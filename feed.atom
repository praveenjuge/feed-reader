        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You've probably experienced pages that "stutter" or "freeze" during scrolling or
animations. We like to say that these experiences are not smooth. To address
these types of issues, the Chrome team has been working on adding more support
to our lab tooling for animation detection, as well making steady improvements
to the rendering pipeline diagnostics within Chromium.
We'd like to share some recent progress, offer concrete tooling guidance, and
discuss ideas for future animation smoothness metrics. As always, we would love
to hear your feedback.
This post will cover three main topics:
A quick look at animations and animation frames.
Our current thoughts on measuring overall animation smoothness.
A few practical suggestions for you to leverage in lab tooling today.

ideas we were considering for a
new responsiveness metric. We want to design a metric that better captures the
end-to-end latency of individual events and offers a more holistic picture of
the overall responsiveness of a page throughout its lifetime.
We've made a lot of progress on this metric in the last few months, and we
wanted to share an update on how we plan to measure interaction latency as well
as introduce a few specific aggregation options we're considering to quantify
the overall responsiveness of a web page.
We'd love to get feedback from developers and site owners as to
which of these options would be most representative of the overall input
responsiveness of their pages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, every one,
As the title suggest, I am a react native developer and I wanted to get a job at FAANG.
From various resources, I’ve come to know that at the starting of career, joining at FAANG may not be a good idea.
So, My initial plan is
 try get selected for internship at siliconvalleyinternship.com/
after spending there 2 years then go for FAANG.
But, Life may not go according to plan. So, I am trying for both.
According to my research, 
I’ve to be good at what I am doing, in my case it will JavaScript, and Design implementation. 
I also have be good at Data Structure and Algorithm
Little Bit about myself:
Top 8% ( 458 reputation ) in Stack Overflow in 2021 ( https://stackoverflow.com/users/14302873/mrpmohiburrahman ) 
I am working as a React Native Developer since 30th December, 2020.
I do not have any kind project to show case
I am willing to work with anything as long as it’s Functional Programming with JS.
This is my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrpmohiburrahman/
What do you suggest?
How can I prepare myself so that I’ll be able to join FAANG as a Front End developer or as JS developer on any stack?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm really confused on this. My understanding on Golang's intentions and design is that it is an intentionally simple language lacking most of traditional OO features. The language is relying on interfaces (and Generics?) for doing most of the things you'd do with classic OO.
Yet I see job ads requiring and even classes teaching Design Pattterns with Golang. And by inquiry I see that they're not talking about Golang-specific DPs (that would make sense) but about fitting traditional OO DPs (and principles like SOLID) to Golang. Which in turn seems to me like bending the language to something it was not designed for in order to fit into models we developed for traditional OO languages like java and C++.
Unsure what is going on here and what the consensus on best practice is (if any).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have new house and feel that you do not want to get tiling done then you can easily paste these tile covers directly on the floor as long as it is completely flat. You can use them even if you do not have tiles on your floor. If you are getting your house remodeled and want to remove the existing tiles, then you can paste them on top of the floors instead of undergoing the hassle of retiling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bootstrap Icons v1.7.0 is here with 120 new and updated icons, taking us over 1,500 total icons for the project! It’s the largest update since the initial release, so keep reading to see what’s new.
120 new icons
This update was a lot of fun for me—drawing all these tiny computer parts most of all! There are dozens of new computer related icons for parts, ports, and peripheral devices. There are also several new brand icons, including Meta, and some other fun icons like a new robot head and a boombox.
Looking for more new icons? Head to the issue tracker to check for open requests or submit a new one.
Install
To get started, install or update via npm:
npm i bootstrap-icons


Or Composer:
composer require twbs/bootstrap-icons


You can also download the release from GitHub, or download just the SVGs and fonts (without the rest of the repository files).
Figma
The Figma file is now published to the Figma Community! It’s the same Bootstrap Icons Figma file you’ve seen from previous releases, just a little more accessible to those using the app.]]></summary>

The demo sets the play-state of the animation depending on the user’s motion preferences (using the prefers-reduced-motion media query). Users could also click the button to toggle motion on and off, which also changes the text of the button to “Turn on motion” or “Turn off motion”. Here’s the original version:

Scott pointed out that some screenreaders wouldn’t announce the change to the button text when the button is clicked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first half of 2022, Chrome will reach a three-digit major version number:
100!  When browsers first reached version 10 many eons ago,
lots of issues were discovered
with User-Agent parsing libraries as the major version number went from one
digit to two.  Now that we are approaching version 100 in both Chrome and
Firefox, with Edge not far behind, we want to detect possible issues related
to three-digit version number early, so we are ready when it becomes a reality.
Starting in Chrome 96, until Chrome 99, a feature flag will be available to force the User-Agent
string to use the major version number 100, regardless of the actual major version
number. It will apply to both the User-Agent request header and the Javascript
APIs (for example, navigator.userAgent).
Similar experiments
are being run on Firefox as well.
Visit
Is Chrome 100 yet? to
check if your browser is sending the major version 100 in the User-Agent
string.
To turn the flag on in Chrome and experiment, type chrome://flags in the address bar and enable
the #force-major-version-to-100 flag.
Visiting
Is Chrome 100 yet?
after enabling the flag reports that the User-Agent has major version number 100.
The goal is to uncover as many issues as possible ahead of time, so send your
bug reports to
Web Compat
and help prepare the web for three-digit major browser version numbers!]]></summary>

It began on Thursday morning with the first Salter Cane band practice in eighteen months. That was pretty safe—three of us in a room, reminding ourselves of how the songs go. I honestly thought it could’ve been a disaster and that I wouldn’t remember anything, but thanks to a little bit of last-minute revision the evening before, it actually went really well. And boy, did it feel good to plug in and play those songs again.
Later that day, Jessica went up to London. We spent that evening in the Royal Opera House, watching a ballet, The Dante Project. We wore masks. Not everyone else did.

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29052246</id>
        <link href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29052246"/>
        <updated>2021-10-30T20:58:54.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are there any, or can we maybe come up with (i.e. suggestions please if it seems like a good idea), HTTP headers that browsers can send to sites that automatically instruct them in terms of:
1. The kinds of cookies I'm willing to accept (e.g. strictly necessary). For example, `X-Prefer-Cookies: strictly-necessary` or `X-Prefer-Cookies: all`.
2. The fact that I don't, and probably never will, care about your newsletter. (If your content really interests me, I'll find a way through your UI to subscribe.) For example: `X-Offer-Newsletter: no`, or `X-Offer-Newsletter: yes`.
If you wanted to facilitate more general UX preference indications from the client side, you could potentially come up with a scheme like `X-UX-Preferences: strictly-necessary-cookies; no-newsletters`.
This way I can set these preferences once in my browser and be done with your annoying cookie selection and newsletter popups (if your site honours those headers, of course).
I think that, if most websites honoured those headers, it might just fix 80% of what I personally feel is wrong with the modern web. (The other 20% I think involves completely eradicating online advertising-driven business models from the face of the planet, which I think is quite a bit harder to achieve than this.)

This blog post is about the implementation of DevTools support for debugging Content Security Policy (CSP) issues with the help of the recently introduced Issues tab.
The implementation work was done in the course of 2 internships:

But now, without JS, you only get the first few lines of content, and the rest is loaded entirely with JS - which… is stupid.
Scribe fixes all that and focuses entirely on the author's content.
I also used the FAQ to auto redirect and now I can read the full content without being distracted by Medium's horrid cruft.
Great example of taking back the web.

The article is based on a single self selected study of 80 individuals sourced from Get The L Out, a group who, prior to the survey, were already united by anti-trans views.
This study breaks the BBC’s own guidelines about using surveys as sources for claims in coverage, as it is self-selected, with a small sample size and a clear bias held by those self-selected to respond.
The article dangerously frames this as a widespread issue, whilst simultaneously acknowledging that there is no actual evidence to that effect outside of isolated claims and cherry picked individual cases.
The article routinely implies that transgender women are not women, uncritically quoting people who call transgender women men without at any point clarifying that this is ignoring their legal status as women in the UK.]]></summary>

Episode one
Coaching. There was one question at the heart of this episode: what’s the difference between training, coaching, and mentoring? I got some great answers to that question, with some good stories along the way.
Episode two
Design Engineering. It will come as no surprise that I really enjoyed this episode. This is a topic I think is growing in importance. The relevation for me was the way Trys framed it less as the intersection between design and development, and more about the gap between design and development. And remember we’re looking for a design engineer to join Clearleft.

in development. This post will be updated as the implementation progresses. 


What is the EyeDropper API? #
Many creative applications allow users to pick colors from parts of the app window or even from the
entire screen, typically using an eyedropper metaphor.
Photoshop, for example, lets users sample colors from the canvas so they don't have to guess a color
and risk getting it wrong. PowerPoint also has an eyedropper tool,
useful when setting the outline or fill color of a shape. Even Chromium DevTools has an eyedropper
you can use when editing colors in the CSS styles panel so you don't have to remember or copy the
color code from somewhere else.

The friend’s neighbor who is slightly younger but was annoying once? Annoying forever! Even if you’ve played with him since! That new friend who said she saw a dinosaur in her backyard? A liar. Forever.
I don’t get it. I try to counsel them out of their beef. Maybe that girl who saw the dinosaur was just pretending, she has a big imagination (and that’s good!), or maybe someone in a dinosaur suit really ran thru the yard. I have one hundred potential scenariors for why she might have said that. We don’t know. And it doesn’t matter, because first of all, seeing a dinosaur sounds bad ass, so why not say it.
Oh, but they’ll undo my words and Wormtongue each other the next day saying “But remember that time…”
I don’t get it. I don’t see myself as a beef holder. Not forever anyways. My wife isn’t a beef holder either. She’s one of the most pleasant people I know. Who taught these kids to hold beef? From whomst was the beef holding begotten? Why hold beef forever? It goes bad. Let the beef go, kid.]]></summary>

One such web application has been Photoshop. The idea of running software as complex as Photoshop directly in the browser would have been hard to imagine just a few years ago. However, by using various new standardized web technologies, Adobe has now brought a public beta of Photoshop to the web.
In this post, we'd like to share for the first time the details of how our collaboration is extending Photoshop to the web. You can use all the APIs Adobe used and more in your own apps as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Question: Hacker News, if someone were designing a new programming language (or library system within an existing language) to mitigate supply chain attacks, what features would be most important to you?
Background: Open-source code has been an amazing boon for software productivity. However, I believe that most of the code that companies run isn't written by their own developers, it is from various packages and frameworks written by outside individuals and groups. My main focus is writing data intensive software where malicious actors, or just poorly written code, could compromise the confidentiality and/or integrity of customer data via a popular package/dependency. Better sandboxing of relatively untrusted code could be a huge boon for applications that have lots of plugins (think Chrome of VS code).
A few thoughts I have had on this front is limiting access of untrusted code to system calls that control file and network access is critical. Also, there would be a need to ensure that dependencies can't "takeover" a process by overwriting the call-stack to run their own code or spawning a new thread / process. Interested in your thoughts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
I and my wife are thinking about starting a web design company, which would target smaller businesses. We would provide custom web and mobile app designs, custom website development, but I was also thinking about providing simple web hosting as well (for small wordpress sites or something similar).
She is great with digital arts and recently started learning web design and UX and she loves it. I'm currently working at a FAANG as a software engineer, but I'm getting more and more bored every day.
However, we are a bit worried whether it is even worth starting a business like this nowadays, because there are countless businesses providing the same services, and I'm not sure if we could get enough clients. Also I've done some research, and found many landing page and website builder tools, some of them are even free.
Is there anything that could make us stand out from the crowd? Is there anything missing in this web design/development space? What could we do to siphon some clients from big web design/development/hosting companies? (other than being extra cheap)

These startups were trying to push code through CI/CD pipelines as frequently as possible, but were stymied by quality assurance. Labor-intensive QA (specifically, smoke, regression, and other UI tests) tended to be the bottleneck preventing CI/CD from delivering on its promise of speed and efficiency. That left a frustrating dilemma for these teams: slow down the release to do QA, or move faster at the expense of product quality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you find yourself designing screens with only a vague idea of how the things on the screen relate to the things elsewhere in the system? Do you leave stakeholder meetings with unclear directives that often seem to contradict previous conversations? You know a better understanding of user needs would help the team get clear on what you are actually trying to accomplish, but time and budget for research is tight. When it comes to asking for more direct contact with your users, you might feel like poor Oliver Twist, timidly asking, “Please, sir, I want some more.” 
Here’s the trick. You need to get stakeholders themselves to identify high-risk assumptions and hidden complexity, so that they become just as motivated as you to get answers from users. Basically, you need to make them think it…]]></summary>

After years of deconstructing and providing valuable commentary on what makes games good, Mark is putting his reputation at stake and trying his hand at game design. Mark has tried making games before but never succeeded because he always started making his game from the wrong direction.
What is the right direction? Well… the answer is: Prototypes.
Mark starts with an ill-fated tale of a Picross-style game he made with folders full of pixel art, animations, juicy buttons but there was one big problem: it wasn’t any fun. Mark said it felt shallow, repetitive, and dull. In his own words:
It comes down to making two very wrong assumptions. Assumption #1 is the game always felt kind of cool in my head, so I just kind of assumed the game wo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Visit ChromeStatus.com for lists of current deprecations and previous removals.
Chrome 96 beta was released on October 21, 2021 and is expected to become the
stable version in late November, 2021.
# The "basic-card" method of PaymentRequest API
The PaymentRequest API has deprecated the basic card payment
method. Its usage is low
and declining. It underperforms when compared to other payment methods in
time-to-checkout and completion rate. Developers can switch to other payment
methods as an alternative. Examples include Google Pay, Apple Pay, and Samsung
Pay.
# Removal timeline
Chrome 96
The basic-card method is deprecated in the Reporting API.
Chrome 100
The basic-card method will be removed.
# Deprecation policy
To keep the platform healthy, we sometimes remove APIs from the Web Platform
which have run their course. There can be many reasons why we would remove an
API, such as:
They are superseded by newer APIs.
They are updated to reflect changes to specifications to bring alignment and
consistency with other browsers.
They are early experiments that never came to fruition in other browsers and
thus can increase the burden of support for web developers.
Some of these changes will have an effect on a very small number of sites. To
mitigate issues ahead of time, we try to give developers advanced notice so they
can make the required changes to keep their sites running.
Chrome currently has a process for deprecations and removals of
API's,
essentially:
Announce on the
blink-dev
mailing list.
Set warnings and give time scales in the Chrome DevTools Console when usage
is detected on the page.
Wait, monitor, and then remove the feature as usage drops.
You can find a list of all deprecated features on chromestatus.com using the
deprecated filter and
removed features by applying the removed
filter. We will also try to
summarize some of the changes, reasoning, and migration paths in these posts.]]></summary>

With this feature, the browser applies an automatically generated dark theme to light themed sites,
when the user has opted into dark themes in the Operating System.
Users can opt-out of dark themes by either disabling the option on the OS level or in a specific setting in Chrome.
# Sign-up for the Origin Trial
You can also enable the darkening algorithm for your users, via an Origin Trial.
This will allow you to test how the Auto Dark Theme performs with regards to your KPIs.

If I have the list of users subscribed to back in stock alert and another table that has latest stock availability, what would be the best appraoch to build an efficient system that looks at these data and trigger back in stock email ?
- Do I poll the stock table for change in stock and then compare with user table and trigger email ? 
- Is there any other better ways of doing it ? Is there any design patterns/ specific tools/ constructs to solve such problems ? I am gravitating towards as event driven model - but not sure what to look out for this problem statement.
I am not looking for a complete solution, but opinions/ pointers to any resource would be greatly appreciated.

Scroll snap, Motion Path, Level 5 Media Queries and CSS functions min(), max() and clamp() are just some of the CSS features that have got me excited in the last year or two, but even these are old-hat compared to the buzz around container queries, or LCH colours, for instance. It can be hard to keep up with the pace of change, but as a developer I would argue that one of the most important qualities to have is curiosity. That doesn’t mean instantly adopting new tools and features the second they arrive (and burning yourself out trying to keep up).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When a browser parses a web page and begins to discover and download resources such as images, scripts, or CSS, it assigns them a fetch priority in an attempt to download resources in an optimal order. These priorities can depend on the kind of resource and where it is in the document. For example, in-viewport images may have a High priority while the priority for early <link> loaded, render-blocking CSS in the <head> could be Very High. Browsers are pretty good at assigning priorities that work well but may not be optimal in all cases.
In this article, we'll discuss Priority Hints and the importance attribute, which allow you to hint at the relative importance of a resource (high or low). Priority Hints can help optimize the Core Web Vitals.

And… it works! If you’re wondering why I made this, the tl;dr is that Sass has a superior way of adjusting the alpha channel on ANY COLOR (rgb, hsl, named color, etc) but that does not work with CSS Custom Properties. This little paint worklet restores that flavor of color manipulation to backgrounds and borders. Here’s a video with a more in-depth explanation:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi HN,
I have to do a university assignment that is about software engineering. Unfortunately, designing user-interfaces (in the UX sense) is not a concern, even though we all have to write a user interfaces.
For my assignment, one component will have to register the minimum, maximum and most likely cost of building a car. These are just estimates that an engineer will do.
The most naive way of doing so would be to put three textboxes that allow the engineer to input whatever he wants. However, only numbers are allowed. Additionally, the manufacturer knows that a car has to cost at least x, and they are not willing to pay more than y.
That could all be done with textboxes, placeholders, validators that show error messages and so on.
But I think a possibly better way would be to have some kind of slider with 3 "blobs" on it that represent min, max and most likely.
The advantages would be that the engineer cannot even select values that are out of bound and having the 3 knobs on the line might even visually represent some skewness to his estimation.
I then went on Google to see if there is any research to "Designing Components" but I'm kinda overwhelmed by "top 10 UI/UX component" answers and MATERIAL.
So I was wondering, how is your process on designing components?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ahmad Shadeed recently published an article where he dug into Facebook’s implementation of the border-radius property on their card components. He had noticed, upon inspecting Facebook’s CSS, that the value for border-radius seemed quite convoluted for what amounted to a value of 8px:
.card {
  border-radius: max(0px, min(8px, calc((100vw - 4px - 100%) * 9999)));
}
After some investigation, Ahmad discovered that this line of CSS was, in fact, a “toggle” — where under some conditions (namely, when the card was less than the full width of the viewport), the toggle would be “flipped”, and the computed value evaluating to 0px. (Read the full article for details of how this works.)

Routing gets easier with URLPattern baked into the browser.
The Eye Dropper API provides a built in tool for selecting

There's a new origin trial that allows you to opt into receiving the

The PWA Summit videos are all online.
And there's plenty more.
I'm Pete LePage, working, and shooting
from home, let's dive in and see what's new for developers in Chrome 95.
# Routing with URLPattern
Nearly all web apps depend on routing in some way whether it's code running
on a server that maps a path to files on disk or logic in a single-page app
that updates the DOM when the URL changes. URLPattern is a new web
platform API that standardizes routing pattern syntax.
It builds on the foundation of existing frameworks, making it easier to perf…]]></summary>

Some errors only occur in production. You won't see them locally or during development because
real users, real networks, and real devices change the game. The Reporting API helps
catch some of these errors⏤such as security violations or deprecated and soon-to-be-deprecated API
calls⏤across your site, and transmits them to an endpoint you've specified. It lets you declare what
you'd like to monitor via HTTP headers, and is operated by the browser.
Setting up the Reporting API gives you peace of mind that when users experience these types of

  API (v1). If you're new to the Reporting API or need detailed usage examples, head over to the main
  post on the Reporting API instead. 

The Reporting API informs you about errors that happen across your site as visitors use it. It gives
you visibility on browser interventions, browser crashes, Content-Security-Policy violations,
COOP/COEP violations, deprecation warnings and more.
A new version of the Reporting API is available. The new API is leaner and more likely to be
supported across browsers.
The legacy Reporting API is named Reporting API v0. The new Reporting API is named
Reporting API v1.

I’m financially engaged with Kevin and I like Texas BBQ, so I thought I’d go. I also thought my former neighbor Cleo was going to be there and wouldn’t it be fun to surprise her.
Cleo didn’t show up. Foiled! I thought she always went to this thing. Ugh. Okay. Reset. I made due, grabbed a plat of free BBQ and sat down. I was now on my own in a sea of retirees running the same free BBQ grift I was running. There were two people under 60: my financial advisor and the person he invited to be the guest speaker. I failed at making small talk, so my tablemates and I sat the long table poking at our meats and the conversation centered around passing the potato salad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week I came across an article titled “Why don’t video games take sex seriously?”… so naturally I clicked it. I was pleased to find the article featured Robert Yang, one of my favorite game designers that I follow on Twitter. I like Yang because our lives are so entirely dissimilar; I’m a straight white guy who makes corporate websites and he’s a gay asian man who makes a lot of homoerotic sex simulator games. If I recall correctly, I started following him about five years ago because of this tweet about level design and I was hooked. Even though I’m not the target audience of his controversial (but yet not controversial) games, I admire and appreciate Yang’s work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few very interesting discussions on Twitter have led me to understand that some folks are talking about Lighthouse scores in a way that is—in my opinion—not as forthright as it could be (intentionally or not). Let’s level set a bit and talk a bit about the different flavors of wiggle room:

Here’s a screenshot of a Lighthouse result from this morning, October 14th, 2021, run on an old MacBook Air (2012) using Chrome 86.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The final episode of season three of the Clearleft podcast is out. Ah, what a bittersweet feeling! On the hand it’s sad that the season has come to an end. But it feels good to look back at six great episodes all gathered together.
Episode six is all about design principles. That’s a topic close to my heart. I collect design principles.
But for this podcast episode the focus is on one specific project. Clearleft worked with Citizens Advice on a recent project that ended up having design principles at the heart of it. It worked as a great focus for the episode, and a way of exploring design principles in general. As Katie put it, this about searching for principles for design principles.
Katie and Maite worked hard on nailing the design principles for the Citizens Advice project. I was able to get some of Maite’s time for her to talk me through it. I’ve also got some thoughts from my fellow Clearlefties Andy and Chris on the topic of design principles in general.
It’s nineteen minutes long and well worth a listen.

And with that, season three of the Clearleft podcast is a wrap!]]></summary>

Overview #
Users are often presented with items, sometimes lots of items, and in these
cases it can be a good idea to provide a way to reduce the list to prevent
choice overload. This
blog post explores filtering UI as a way to reduce choices. It does this by
presenting item attributes that users can select or deselect, reducing results
and therefore reducing choice overload.
Interactions #
The goal is to enable swift traversal of filter options for all users and their
varying input types. This will be delivered with an adaptable and responsive
pair of components. A traditional sidebar of checkboxes for…]]></summary>

September was a good month, a month of rebirth. New projects, rebooting stalled projects, pool closing, kids in school; a rhythm. Walks, boats, ebooks, I even bought a new iPad Mini to support my YouTube and RSS habits. Today my daughter turns six and I’m particularly sensitive to the passage of time. Lots of sunshine, lots of roses, but this month did bring with it some bad news.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Things can move pretty quickly around here. In addition to the change log, we're publishing monthly summaries of some of the highlights of features and changes made to WebPageTest in the last month.
Overview
The custom waterfall page got a significant redesign
WebPageTest now uses Chrome's Dev Tools priorities
The Element Timing API is now supported
The Locations API endpoint can be filtered by a single location
We now warn you if we think your TTFB might be inaccurate
Custom waterfall redesign and dynamic adjustments
One of the (many) features that is a little tucked away in WebPageTest is the ability to customize the waterfall by choosing what metrics and information to hide or display, truncating the waterfall to a given duration and even zooming in on individual requests.
It's a handy …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new episode of the Clearleft podcast just dropped and I have to say, this is one of my favourites so far. It’s all about measuring design.
There was a bit of a theme running through UX Fest earlier this year. On the one hand, there was all the talk of designers learning to speak the language of business (to get that coveted seat at the table), which means talking in numbers. But on the other hand, isn’t there a real danger in reducing user experience to numbers in a spreadsheet?
For this episode I put the narrative together using lots of snippets from different talks, not just from UX Fest but from previous Clearleft events too. I also got some good hot takes from my colleagues Chris, Andy, and Maite. Oh, and it opens with former US Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara. If you know, you know.
This episode comes in at 22 and a half minutes and I think it’s well worth your time. Have a listen.

This is the penultimate episode of season three. Just one more to go!]]></summary>

What concerns me about this practice is that it glosses over a lot of important nuance, and it perpetuates the idea that synthetic or lab-based tools (like Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and many others) are genuine and precise assessments of a site’s actual, real-world performance—rather than what they are: tools to test, debug, diagnose, optimize, and predict performance or detect regressions under a set of controlled conditions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bootstrap v5.1.2 is here with a handful of improvements across our components, plus a fix for an issue in another project that prevented our Sass from compiling properly. Keep reading for the highlights.
Highlights
Temporarily patched a postcss-values-parser issue by rearranging our calc() functions that use negative numbers. This should restore the ability to import and compile Bootstrap’s Sass in create-react-app.
Added border-radius sizes to small and large .form-selects
Added align-self: center to buttons for improved rendering in flex containers
Fixed Collapse regression that prevented toggling between sibling children
Updated JS Sanitizer to add sms in the SAFE_URL_PATTERN
Improved docs around .img-fluid
Added role="switch" to our form switches in our docs
Implemented GitHub Issue forms to replace our previous issue templates.
Up next
Up next is our v5.2.0 release, adding more utility improvements and fixing an issue with how Sass handles re-assigned maps and variables. Alongside that, we’ll be shipping an update to v4 soon as well.
Get the release
Head to https://getbootstrap.com for the latest. It’s also been pushed to npm:
npm i bootstrap


Review the GitHub v5.1.2 release changelog for a complete list of changes since our last release.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many sites use third-party embeds to create an engaging user experience by delegating some sections of a web page to another content provider. The most common examples of third-party content embeds are video players, social-media feeds, maps, and advertisements.
Third-party content can impact the performance of a page in many ways. It can be render-blocking, contend with other critical resources for network and bandwidth, or affect the Core Web Vitals metrics. Third-party embeds may also cause layout shifts as they load. This article discusses performance best practices that you can use when loading third-party embeds, efficient loading techniques, and the Layout Shift Terminator tool that helps reduce layout shifts for popular embeds.
