        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are two things that almost every website does that just drive me nuts, and I don’t understand the reasoning that would lead to these designs.
1) Login link for existing users is tiny and hidden
Why?!? I get it, you want new users, but your existing users need to log in too!
2) auto play of video previews.
Netflix, YouTube, Etc… they all do it. I don’t want the movie to start because I clicked to read the full description, or worse on the main screen just because I stop navigating for a second to read the blurb. I don’t want videos in my suggested feed on YouTube to play silently and then start 20 or 30 seconds into the video once I do click them. Does ANYBODY find these useful?  Why are they the default behaviors? Who do they benefit? Don’t they just end up costing unnecessary bandwidth?  I know that I can usually turn them off, but having to search for the setting is frustrating.
…and don’t even get me started on form validators that are overly strict when they could just strip the unwanted delimiters or white space themselves, or password fields that cannot be pasted, or password rules that make it impossible to generate a random password.

        <link href="https://daverupert.com/2023/04/arc-boosts-elk/"/>
        <updated>2023-04-28T21:40:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my favorite ideas for Twitter was by Oliver Reichenstein in a post called “Make Bots Identifiable”. Oliver makes the case that apps should notify users if the author of the post is a feed, a bot, or an actual human and the UI of the application should reflect that accordingly. The example Oliver gives is setting bot text into monospace and giving it an obvious 🤖 icon.

It’s a simple premise: “make bots identifiable”. Think of how this would neuter Russian disinformation worldwide. It would expose the underbelly of buying bot followers, exposing fake influencers and hustlers as social and political frauds. This, of course, depends on social media companies running bot analysis on their users, which they’d never do because it would pollute the New Users Chart Goes Brrrr metrics that Wall Street loves.
On Mastodon, however, you can self-identify your account as a human or a bot. Not every feed/bot account does this and not every Mastodon client reflects this option in their UI, but one that does is Elk. Bots in the main feed get a small 🤖 icon, like in Oliver’s dream! I decided to use Arc’s Boosts feature to add some custom CSS to make the text monospace for an even more obvious effect.

/* Elk.zone */
div[flex]:has([i-mdi\:robot-outline]) .status-body {
  font-family: monospace;
}


The result is obvious and clear.

Simple selector, not the cleanest, but got to use :has(). It’d be nice if more Mastodon clients (or Twitter, or YouTube, or Twitch, or Bluesky, or whatever’s next) surfaced this kind of information in the main feed. Anyways…
Arc Boosts are cool 😎

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Would love to share a new open-source project I've been working on - Runnable.
Runnable is a framework to build user-facing admin-like workflows with ease, while keeping operations internal. No need to setup REST or GraphQL for internal applications.
There are other similar tools out there that have comparable features, but Runnable is fully open-source and is much easier to set up (due to its simplicity). For example, it does not require a DB or even it's own server. There is an option to use Runnable as a library or as a standalone web-socket server.
Site here: https://getrunnable.com/
You can demo Runnable here https://demo.getrunnable.com/admin/login and login with any Google creds.
Open to feedback and feature requests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! Alexis and Tobi here. We built a native macOS client for ChatGPT API that is free to use (macOS Ventura).
https://www.jamgpt.app/
We built and fine-tuned it to scratch our own specific text-processing itches, so we just wanted to share this with the community.
If you work with a lot of text or code like we do, check it out.
Its core features include:
- Instantly talk to ChatGPT from anywhere on your Mac by pressing a keyboard shortcut.
- Avoid typing out repetitive prompts by saving prompts and accessing them quickly.
- Just download and start typing as you would with ChatGPT. No need to learn anything new.
- Comes with both dark and light mode options
Batteries included: For the first 100 prompts, you can use our API key to try it out right away. After that, you can add your own OpenAI API key. The app is completely free to use and will remain so.
We may add additional pro features in the future, but we have no commercial intentions at the moment. Whatever you see now will remain free.
This is our first version, so things aren't perfect yet, and some features might be missing.
Give it a spin and let’s talk! We’d love to hear your feedback.
Cheers! Tobi & Alexis

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I fixed a couple little bugs and released a new version of my minimalist CSS framework. I built this to scratch my own itch and I've been using it for a few years as the starting point for most of my own websites.
I noticed I hadn't shared this with HN for about 18 months (5 or 6 minor version changes) so I thought it might be okay to do that now.
Edit: Err, I missed a post from 7 months ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Source maps let you keep your code readable and debuggable even after you've combined and minified it, without impacting performance. To learn how source maps work, see the previous DevTools Tips video.
  
  

Watch this video to learn how to work with source maps in DevTools:
Enable source maps.
Use Developer Resources tab to check if source maps loaded successfully.
If required, load source maps manually.
Debug your (mapped) original code instead of deployed as you normally would.
Group the files you author to navigate the file tree in Sources easier.

# Use WebCodecs VideoFrame source in importExternalTexture()
WebGPU exposes an API to create opaque "external texture" objects from HTMLVideoElement through importExternalTexture(). You can use these objects to sample the video frames efficiently, potentially in a 0-copy way directly from the source YUV data.
However, the initial WebGPU specification does not allow creating GPUExternalTexture objects from WebCodecs VideoFrame objects. This capability is important for advanced video processing apps tha…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CSS media queries are a powerful
tool that allow you to control the appearance of your website or web app based
on the device it is being viewed on. With media queries, you can create
different layouts for different screen sizes, orientations, and other factors.
The
update
media query gives you a way to adapt the UI to the refresh rate of a device. The
feature can report a value of fast, slow, or none which relates to the
capabilities of different devices..

# Devices and refresh rate
Most of the devices you design for are likely to have a fast refresh rate. This
includes desktops and most mobile devices.
You can query the device, see if it has a fast refresh rate for rendering
content, and style accordingly while still delivering a single stylesheet.
@media (update: fast) {
  /* computer screens, totally cool to animate */
}
eReaders, and devices such as low powered payment systems, may have a slow
refresh rate. Knowing that the device can’t handle animation or frequent
updates, means that you can save battery usage or faulty view updates.
@media (update: slow) {
  /* e-book readers or severely underpowered devices */
}
Lastly, there are scenarios like printed paper or e-ink displays that may only
offer a single render pass. Output like this cannot refresh at all, and is
referred to as none. It can be queried like this:
@media (update: none) {
  /* one time render like printed paper */
}
In the following CodePen, see a progressively enhanced hover animation using
this new update media query:

This is how I would build a social media app as an example. But it works for a wide variety applications, from social to money to inventory tracking, and it's served me well each time.
1. Make each table a logical collection of events that have occurred, not objects or state. This is not CRUD. One row means one event, for example a table `react` means "a user reacted to some post." Keep these events as close as possible to the end user's intent.
2. Never delete or update rows as a way to record events. This would mean forgetting that something happened. Only do that for manual corrections or spec…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With 2023 graphic design trends taking shape, one of the most popular trends we’re seeing is creative experimentation with Risoprint effects. Risograph printing, also known as ‘riso’ printing, is a unique printing process that has been around since the 1980s but has recently gained popularity among designers for its charming imperfections and vibrant colors. While traditionally used for zines and other print media, digital designers are now also experimenting with incorporating risoprint effects into their work to add a touch of retro charm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Please hear me out: Do not consider this as some unrealistic ambitious project that I am going to pursue. This is purely a thought experiment and design discussion on the feasibility of the idea that bothers me.
I use Emacs most of the time. I do consider it a great piece of software purely due to its extensible nature. I can go on about how Emacs is fabulous, but that is not the point here.
I use VSCODE too. And it is also a great text editor based on Electron.
Electron is a great framework too.
Most of us while doing software development, use a browser. Either for browsing documentation, finding answers, checking the meaning of the error messages, etc. We copy code from the editor, shell to the browser, and back to the editor, and shell.
Also using electron we can create almost any kind of desktop application. Currently what is happening is we create/ship the entire Chrome/JS run time to create an entirely new application for each specific case.
Now let's try to put the pieces together.
Why can't there be a single editor that has a similar extensible nature as emacs but uses JavaScript as the scripting language, and develop extension using HTML and CSS unlike only a text-based extension using elisp in emacs, so that we can leverage the Chrome runtime efficiently?
Why can't we browse the web, edit text, and use the terminal all simultaneously?
Yes, anything is possible given that we solve the hurdles.
Based on your expertise and experience what challenges do you consider one may face during the design and implementation of these requirements?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Hacker News community,
I wanted to share with you a tool I created called MonitUp that has helped me improve my productivity by tracking my computer activities and providing weekly recommendations based on the data.
MonitUp tracks which apps and websites I use during the day, and based on that data, it offers recommendations on how I can better manage my time and be more productive. For example, it has suggested that I create a schedule for myself that includes time for work, rest, and leisure activities, and to prioritize my tasks so that I'm focusing on the most important ones first.
I created MonitUp because I was struggling with productivity and wanted a way to track my time and get recommendations on how to improve. It has been incredibly helpful for me, and I wanted to share it with the Hacker News community.
I'm not here to advertise my product, but rather to share my experience and offer a recommendation for anyone who is looking for a tool to help them improve their productivity. If you're interested in trying MonitUp out, feel free to visit our website at https://timetracking.monitup.com/ and sign up for a free trial.
I'm also here to ask for feedback from the community. What do you think about MonitUp? What other features would you like to see? How can I improve the tool to better serve our users?
Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.
Best,
Faruk Durak

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im back on an intentional job search and unfortunately started going back on linkedin just to get a wider exposure to job postings. 
Am somewhat surprised by this but linkedin website on mobile (not the app) does not seem to have any way to log out from the account. I looked for a couple minutes and couldn’t find anything so it’s possible I missed it - but nothing is obvious.
Additionally, the expected place one would look for such a “feature” is the top right of the page - and that’s where the mobile site puts the link to messages. So it seems to be kind of an intentional loop into getting Users to view messages rather than leaving.
Am somewhat dumbfounded by this but certainly seems like a dark pattern. Phuck you linkedin for this kind of stuff. I’ve always hated this platform and know others share similar feelings (and know there are advocates for it - fair enough).
My browser is set to not store cookies/cache anyway so after closing the mobile browser I was logged out. But good riddance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an interface on top of the OpenAI API for GPT-3 and 4. It looks similar to ChatGPT, but has a few more features.
It does require you to have an API key for the GPT API. The API key is stored in your browser local storage , but a hash of it is used to make sure your history is unique to you. The hash is stored in the backend.
There are two main reasons why I created this for myself, you also might find it useful:
- I would really wanted ChatGPT to have access get contents from websites
- I don't like subscription fees and I don't like how slow the free ChatGPT is, I like to pay-as-I-go, and GPT API already allows me to do that
P.S. There's also a Chrome extension for summarising pages, but it's my first time creating a Chrome extension. It's ugly and buggy, and the slow review process of the Chrome web app developer  console doesn't help.

I find web development to be mostly css(frontend) and if you lack css skills, you can't be a good web developer.

What I’m looking for is the fastest way to prototype UIs for single page web apps.

Policies and law haven't been written and it's the experts that don't even have the confidence you'd hope to hear about:

50% of A.I. researchers believe there's a 10% or greater chance that humans go extinct from our inability to control AI

Tristan Harris and Aza Raskin discuss the risk to society and how safety measures are far from adequate and laws need to be implemented.

When you invent a new technology, you uncover a new class of responsibilities

It's a long watch at a little over an hour, but strongly recommend as we plough head long into a future where AI is inter-tangled with society.

Does anybody know if there's a font awesome icon or HTML tags or legal guidance from creative commons that can be used as a canonical placeholder for publishing art or generated code or articles using AI. I could find stuff like this:

But nothing suggesting a style handling disclosure of the AI generation, a tag, an icon, legal marking or anything authoritative that targets both human and computer consumption (crawling, etc.). I'd prefer something easy-to-copy in text or HTML or the like.
Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[# The birth of test automation
Let's rewind back to the 1990s when the web browser was born. Test automation didn't become a reality until the 2000s, with the emergence of Selenium and WebDriver projects to tackle cross-browser and multi-device testing challenges.
These two projects joined forces in 2011 as Selenium WebDriver and became a W3C standard in 2018. We usually refer to it as WebDriver or WebDriver “Classic”.
The evolution of the Selenium WebDriver project

Test automation prior to WebDriver “Classic” was quite tricky. Being able to automate browser testing significantly improved the quality of developers’ and testers’ lives.

OO design, problem solving, coding it, testing it etc. Does such a thing exist? Sort of like Practical OO Design in Ruby in screencast form? Or even pairing sessions on a problem?

AI can help designers overcome limited resources for research by providing quick and efficient access to data and insights.
Recognizing the potential to harness the vast knowledge available on the internet, I identified an opportunity in leveraging Language Models (LLMs) to create QoQo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What’s the current state and future of work-from-anywhere, productivity devices for someone with poor vision?
I’m not talking about answering emails at the coffee shop with a laptop. I’m talking about hanging off a glacier in the sun, writing code.
And by poor vision, I mean, corrected, I can just about read a newspaper in poor lighting. I can’t see your laptop over your shoulder. You’ll need to jack up the font size, thanks. I’ve never understood shiny screens, it’s like a mirror to me.
I’m not worried about power supply, yet. The current state of batteries should be fine.
Also connectivity is not a problem, yet. I’ll tether my phone, or use some satellite service.
I appreciate that this is idealistic but bear with me. My dream life scenario is that I’m on some physical adventure/expedition, and suddenly we need some code to save our lives. (Anyone do this?)
So I need terminals, IDE’s, connectivity, text and voice based communication, GPT. All the good stuff. I don’t need high resolution or photo/video editing, yet.
Less ambitiously and more realistically, I’d like to work in my back garden when the sun is out.
I’ve always been on the fence about keyboards. I don’t like the rigid posture required but I have adapted to become an efficient user of this tool. And fixing the keyboard to the tiny screen (classic laptop) makes it worse. I’ve always thought we can do better.
Am I just looking for a rugged E-ink tablet?
I should also add, I’m super optimistic and re-energised about where the tech is headed with E-ink for displays and GPT for productivity. The opportunities feel liberating.
Thanks

# The problem
The reading order of an HTML document follows the source order. This means that a screen reader will read the document as it is laid out in the source, and a person using the keyboard to tab around the document will also follow that source order. Usually this makes sense, and a sensible source order for the document is vital for reading mode presentations of content, screen readers, and any device with limited CSS.

When I got around to opening the watch (using the same screw bit for the classic) the lipo battery inside had … popped, I guess. It was bad.
Thankfully I found a few replacements on Ebay (as the batteries are particularly small) and with some careful soldering (to some very small solder point) and squeezing of wires to fit into such a tiny space, the Pebble Steel lives again. That's 3 Pebbles I've revived in recent months - I've just got one Pebble Classic left to fix!]]></summary>

If you’re on Chrome 111 or later, you might have already noticed that we’ve changed the design of our breakpoint sidebar. With Chrome 113, the new sidebar entirely replaces the old design. Our goal with the redesign was to improve the breakpoint workflow by:
Providing a better overview on all breakpoints that are set.
Making common user workflows with breakpoints easier to access and more intuitive.
Making cool existing breakpoint features visible.
This post assumes that you are already familiar with debugging using breakpoints. If you haven’t used breakpoints before, head over to this overview on breakpoints and learn more about how you can use breakpoints to debug your code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
Aron (@arondeparon) here, founder of Gistreader.com.
I was an avid user of Google Reader back in the day, but for some reason, I silently rolled over when they decided to kill it and never looked at RSS again.
Lately, I am getting more and more frustrated by the fact that most of the content that I consume is being pushed at me by some kind of algorithm. I wanted more control over this process, so decided to build GistReader.
In its basic form, GistReader is an RSS reader that aims to make your reading experience as fast and pleasant as possible. In addition to that, it uses AI to automatically create summaries of your articles and uses text-to-speech to optionally read a condensed version of an article to you out loud.
GistReader is my first-ever product launch, so as you might expect, I'm pretty nervous about that, especially when it comes to sharing it on HN :)
Please, feel free to let me know what you think. It's all very early-days (lots of things I want to fix/improve/build) and the only way I can improve is by getting solid feedback from people that might actually use it.
Thanks!

WebGPU is a new web graphics API that offers significant benefits such as greatly reduced JavaScript workload for the same graphics and more than three times improvements in machine learning model inferences. This is possible due to more flexible GPU programming and access to advanced capabilities that WebGL does not provide.
This initial release of WebGPU is available on ChromeOS, macOS, and Windows. Support for other platforms is coming later this year.

But let’s not get distracted from the task at hand: we want to evaluate a few different options on the table to apply styles (CSS) to our web components.
Here are the things we want to think about:

The touch screen, after testing, was fine too. Maybe it was the ribbon that needed re-seating, and I did completely take the DS Lite apart and re-shell it (originally it was red with a LOT of stickers) - I feel like the re-shell has a bit of a Star Wars dark side vibe!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I've been playing around with doc2.site which uses Google Docs to create web pages. I tried several Chat GPT plugins to enhance my doc content with semantics like headings, emphasised text etc.
The problem is I always get plain text responses from Chat GPT (and plugins) even if you ask for the HTML output and then if you copy paste the output into Google Docs, you get the HTML tags like 
blah
.I found a script that does copy the output as HTML:
"const blob = new Blob([html], {type: 'text/html'});" so it's super easy actually but I couldn't find a plugin that handles it nicely like a copy paste response as HTML button.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting with Chrome 114, the Chrome team is reducing the time between the branch for a release, and the actual release to stable. The aim is to shorten the time it takes to launch, and reduce merges.
This will not change the release date for Chrome stable or early stable. It will, however, align the beta release date across platforms. Before Chrome 114, the iOS release went to beta a week before the Desktop and Android releases.
The following table shows how this change affects the 114 release.
Stage
      Chrome 114 (Old)
      Chrome 114 (Revised)
    
Feature Freeze
      Thu, Apr 6
      Tue, Apr 11
    
Branch 
      Thu, Apr 20
      Tue, Apr 25
    
Beta Promotion
      Thu, May 4
      Wed, May 3
    
Beta Promotion (iOS)
      Wed, Apr 26
      Wed, May 3
    
Stable Cut
      Tue, May 23
      Tue, May 23
    
Stable Cut (iOS)
      Tue, May 16
      Tue, May 23
    
Early Stable Release
      Wed, May 24
      Wed, May 24
    
Stable Release
      Tue, May 30
      Tue, May 30
    
Note that Chrome 115 stable will be delayed for two weeks to accommodate the July release freeze, all dates after this have been adjusted to account for the two week delay.
You can keep track of upcoming releases on the Chrome Status Roadmap, and see the schedule in detail on the Chromium Dashboard. We publish a post on this site for each beta release, so you can keep track of upcoming changes to Chrome.

However, it seems the new owner has lost interest - more and more bugs keep showing up and there is no way to contact support. So I'm looking for a new reader. It would be great if it had a fast, minimalist web interface, mobile support, generous free tier (long enough for me to decide whether I like the service or not) and customer support.

I’m Adriana Jara. Let’s dive in and see what’s new for developers in Chrome 111.
# CSS support for nesting.
One of our favorite CSS preprocessor features is now built into the language: nesting style rules.
Before nesting, every selector needed to be explicitly declared, separately from
one another. This leads to repetition, stylesheet bulk, and a scattered authoring
experience.
.nesting {
  color: hotpink;
}
.nesting > .is {
  color: rebeccapurple;
}
.nesting > .is > .awesome {
  color: deeppink;

After nesting, selectors can be

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm obsessed with OpenAI and ChatGPT and I want to work on a voice powered version so that I can just chat with it directly.
I find the streaming text based response distracting and honestly I'd just like to talk to it as if it were a partner/collaborator.
My thinking is to use OpenAI Whisper as the Speech to Text (STT) input:
https://openai.com/research/whisper
Then stream the results to a Text To Speech (TTS).
I'm going to use the raw OpenAI chat API to access GPT directly.
I'm going to OSS it and put it up on Github.
The problem I'm having now is that I need a way to stream the output of ChatGPT to the the TTS system.
I think I need something BETTER than the Google Cloud Speech API so I'm looking for a recommendation.
My idea is to buffer the output from GPT until I have 1-2 sentences, THEN start streaming that, on sentence boundaries, to the TTS system.
That should enable both low latency responses but also give the TTS system a decent chance of making the results sound like an actual human without any jarring breaks (at least I hope)
The problem is that the Google Cloud Speech API doesn't have a streaming API.
Though I guess if I only send 2-3 sentences at a time that I can aggregate these in the client and keep the latency small.
Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot on the heels of our second alpha, we’re releasing a third (and unexpected) alpha for v5.3.0 today with some fixes for some Node Sass compilation errors. In addition, we’ve added a handful of other updates. We’re still on target to ship our stable release soon!
Once again, if you’re new to the v5.3.0 alpha releases, please read through the Migration guide for the first alpha and last month’s second alpha.
Here’s a look at what’s changed in this quick release:
Fixed wrong interpolated variables with node-sass/Hugo.
Added a check for interpolated variables to catch compilation errors with Node Sass when using Sass variables in calc() functions.
Started using --bs-border-radius variables across more components.
Added .d-inline-grid utility class.
Fixed .tooltip-inner placement when using variations in fallbackPlacements.
Fix selectors for dark mode carousel overrides when compiling with $color-mode-type: media-query.
Updated the styling of floating labels when “floated” to include a background-color to help with multiple lines of text in textareas. This also fixes the colors when form elements are disabled in floating forms.
Updated RFS to v10.0.0.
Get the release
Head to https://getbootstrap.com for the latest. It’s also been pushed to npm:
npm i bootstrap@v5.3.0-alpha3


Read the GitHub v5.3.0-alpha3 changelog for a complete list of changes in this release.

I think when I wrote it I wanted someone to discuss it with, but I’ve since realised it’s a very boring topic to many, and still most get offended by the mere challenging of their beliefs.
It’s not to say I am certain what this book says is correct, but that I would love to understand another’s point of view of… well, nothing at all.
I’ve been a little too obsessed with this concept for a few years now, and don’t regret writing the book, but can’t help but think I could have had a few more discussion if I wrote about, literally, anything else (that isn’t nothing)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We made ParallelGPT - a tool that lets you bulk process chatGPT on a spreadsheet UI instead of one-by-one conversation style. Hopefully this saves you time and hassle - especially if you want to build an operational process around it and want to collaborate your team.
You can give it a quick spin on this live demo playground: https://demo.rowy.io/table/parallelGpt#sideDrawer=%22table-i...
I am the co-founder of Rowy(https://www.rowy.io), an open-source low-code platform, and we built ParallelGPT as a fun showcase of what you can do with low-code.
There are tons of exciting AI apps you can build with low-code, and we're always happy to chat about any ideas you have and assist on our Discord.

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35386850</id>
        <link href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35386850"/>
        <updated>2023-03-31T13:28:52.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At work, we recently discussed the issues arising from UX/UI designers using visual tools like Figma or Sketch to create mockups that front-end developers have to manually reverse-engineer into HTML/CSS. While these tools provide useful means of visual expression, they often lead to developers having to infer design vocabulary from the mockups themselves, causing a loss of value and potential misinterpretations.
As a community, how can we bridge the gap between visual and text-based web design to preserve design reasoning and intent? Are there better ways to communicate design requirements without relying solely on visual mockups? How can we emphasize the importance of a clear connection between description and visual presentation in modern web design tools to avoid costly mistakes and improve accessibility?
