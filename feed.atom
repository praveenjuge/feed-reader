        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN, my name is Chris. My team and I are excited to announce the launch of our new open source UI component library called Skeleton.
We've been hard at work for several months and am thrilled to finally pull back the curtain. The goal is to put it out there, let folks go hands on, and gather any feedback we can. If there's bug, a component you would like to see added etc., then we want to know so we can continue to grow and make this better for everyone.
Being open source, we welcome any contributions from the community. If you're interested in joining, you can find us on Github:
https://github.com/Brain-Bones/skeleton
And yes, we realize that the combination of Svelte and Tailwind may place us in a niche. Personally speaking, we've had a lot of success with these technologies in the real world. We love what Rich Harris and his team are bringing to the frontend space with Svelte and SvelteKit, and have found Tailwind to be a great boon when creating design systems for web-based apps We're really hoping Skeleton can bridge the gap and provide the best of both worlds, while saving you the time of recreating these components yourself.
That's really the biggest benefit of Skeleton - the tight integration between Svelte and Tailwind CSS. It utilizes Tailwind’s utility classes to customize and extend the look and feel of each component. Then pairs this with Svelte’s awesome component architecture. This allows you to create customized, responsive, and reactive interfaces with surprisingly minimal effort.
Of course, feel free to try it out for yourself. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm excited to see what everyone can produce with Skeleton!
Thanks!

<form action="/waitlist/success" name="waitlist" netlify>
	... form goes here ...
</form>


Netlify now intercepts these form requests, stores the results in a waitlist table, and lets us download them as a CSV. Huzzah.
CSVs are great and all, they power the business world, but we wanted to take it one step further and update a Notion database whenever someone uses the form. This gives us a lil’ impromptu CRM for adding metadata and tracking invite statuses internally when those start going out.

- Block-based editor
- Drag to reorder blocks
- Basic Markdown-parsing including bold, italic, headings and divider
- Type '/' for command menu and shortcuts
Tiny fun detail: When you move between blocks with your arrow keys, your cursor will remain at roughly the same horizontal position (vs jumping to the start or end of a block).
Lotion is quite limited for now, and we would love any contributions (e.g. image blocks, video blocks, code blocks, etc.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CSS nesting is a convenience syntax addition that allows CSS to be added inside
of a ruleset. If you've used
SCSS,
Less or
Stylus, then
you've most certainly seen a few flavors of this:
.nesting {
  color: hotpink;
  > .is {
    color: rebeccapurple;
    > .awesome {
      color: deeppink;
    }
  }
}
Which after being compiled to regular CSS by the preprocessor, turns into
regular CSS like this:
.nesting {
  color: hotpink;
}
.nesting > .is {
  color: rebeccapurple;
}
.nesting > .is > .awesome {
  color: deeppink;
}
An official CSS version of this syntax is being strongly considered and we have
a split in preference that we'd like to employ the help of the community to
break the tie. The rest of this post will be introducing the syntax options so
you can feel informed to take a survey at …]]></summary>

Odd number grids are a sore point in Responsive Design.

I сhoosed Svelte+TailwindCSS to get more familiar with frameworks as I planning to use it on my next project(probably SvelteKit+TailwindCSS and SSR on Firebase function).
But to get started, decided to begin with something simple, pure Svelte+TailwindCSS and Firebase hosting.
And as my morning routine starts with some workout, decided to implement CrossFit timers.
This simple project allow me to understand more deeply:
  - work with components and cross-component communication 
  - work with local storage (custom store), so you can save yours timers to local storage
  - PWA capabilities, you can install it on your device and it can work in offline mode.
  - get familiar with utility classes and configuration of Tailwind
  - deploy it to Firebase hosting
Few words about product's features: Four different timers available (Tabata, EMOM, AMRAP, RFT); possibility to save your timer; you can share your timers e.g. between your devices or with your friends or audience(for this purpose, custom URL parser/generator was implemented as Svelte doesn't support routing unlike SvelteKit/Sapper); PWA and Offline mode.
Conclusion/Impression: 
It's pleasure to work with Svelte, it allows you write well structured code, all concepts are understandable and easy to apply, pre built animations and transition, flexibility
With TailwindCSS you can quickly prototype UI components with any complexity with 99% of cases, otherwise extensions are available.
Firebase allowed me to deploy the app in few clicks and, as it just hosting, free quotes are available.

While much of the world suffers from extreme high temperures this summer, climate change has become a visible, tangible issue for many of us.
Dave rightly points out that the environmental responsibility has been unfairly hoisted onto the consumer, when in reality this is by the design of governments and large corporations, who have vested interests in maintaining the status quo. Individual lifestyle changes, such as reusable shopping bags, sorting our recycling, or going vegan are never going to make much of a difference when faced with the unstoppable juggernaut of capitalism.

More worryingly, it’s another summer in what looks like a trend of increasingly hot summers due to unstoppable climate change. It’s hot enough that the grass is dying in places that don’t have shade. The heat is so exhausting we’re making trips to cooler states in the summer to escape, ironically those trips are on planes, which exacerbates the climate problem.
I’m desperate to figure out a way I can help. I keep researching what ascetic life changes I could make to have the biggest impact. I could go vegan tomorrow if it made a big difference… but… and I hate to be a cynic… but one dude in Texas changing his diet isn’t going to save the Earth. It wouldn’t even move the needle.
My biggest point of frustratio…]]></summary>

First time submitter here.
After a FOSS related interaction required me to use Google Forms 9 months, I wondered on why no such FOSS tool existed and decided to build it myself. I aimed the site to be for people like me, so no telemetry and minimal JS was the goal. I know this is rather small and incomplete compared to other projects but I've thought you folk might be interested.
Not sure if it breaks the pure part, but the site also uses Flask.
If you're lucky, you might find the app alive at: https://formie.div72.xyz.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the perspective of static site generation, is there a tool to compile HTML+CSS in order to minimize download size?
I'm imagining something which takes the following HTML+CSS:
    
    h1{color:red;}
    h2{color:blue;}
    .custom{display:none;}
    .custom2{display:inline;}
    
    ...
    
Hello
lorem ipsum
dolor sit amet

And transforms it into this:
    
Hello
lorem ipsum
dolor sit amet

However, it should not always inline the css styles, because sometimes that would cause the result to be larger than the original, like this:
    
    h1{color:red;}
    h2{color:blue;}
    .custom{display:none;}
    .custom2{display:inline;background-color:yellow;}
    
    ...
    
Hello
lorem ipsum
dolor sit amet

Here, 
 is shorter than 
, so it should remain unchanged.
I'm not talking about tools like https://htmlcompressor.com/compressor/ which only remove whitespace, or gzip compression. What I want is something that understands the semantics of HTML+CSS and can intelligently inline iff that reduces the size of the resulting HTML file.

Keep reading for highlights from both beta and stable releases.
Docs redesign
As previewed in our beta release, the docs have been redesigned! It starts with our new homepage  where we have a more complete representation of Bootstrap’s features and an updated design.


The docs sidebar navigation has been overhauled to have always expanded groups for easier browsing, a brand new DocSearch experience with search history, and new responsive offcanvas drawers for both sidebar and navbar on mobile.




We even updated our version picker in the navbar to cross-link between minor releases!

        <updated>2022-07-19T15:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After several months, we’ve finally shipped Bootstrap v4.6.2, one of our last releases for the v4. It’s a bit of a maintenance patch featuring bug fixes, dependency updates, and some docs updates.
Read on for the highlights or head to the v4.6.x docs to see the latest in action.
What’s changed
There are two big highlights in v4.6.2:
First, we’ve added an example to our Collapse plugin docs to show how to use horizontal collapsing. This has long been possible via our JS, but we never had an official class to utilize it.
Second, we’ve replaced the deprecated color-adjust with print-color-adjust in our Sass files as part of the Autoprefixer v10.4.6 issues. This should quiet the issues folks have seen from that dependency change. If you’re using our distribution CSS files, like bootstrap.min.css, you may still see the warning.
Beyond that, we’ve addressed a few other things:
Tweaked the size of small and .small to compute to a whole pixel value (was 12.8px and now is 14px).
Improved accessibility around our dropdowns, color contrast, and role attributes.
Fixed some broken links to supporting documentation.
Updated dependencies across the board.
Review the GitHub v4.6.2 release changelog for more details.
From here, we don’t expect to ship any meaningful updates to v4.6.x other than major security or dependency updates. Everything will focus on v5 and beyond after this release, starting with the stable release of v5.2.0. Bootstrap 4 will officially end of life January 1, 2023, though you’re obviously welcome to continue using it longer than that. Follow our release repo to stay in the loop on release maintenance status.

        <link href="https://css-irl.info/logical-properties-for-useful-shorthands/"/>
        <updated>2022-07-19T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something I like about logical properties is the ability to set margins or padding on just a single axis on an element, while leaving the other alone. Say we have an element on which we’ve set some padding using the padding shorthand:
/* This gives us 1rem padding all the way around */
.box {
  padding: 1rem;
}
If, later on, we want to adjust the padding only on the x-axis (while preserving our original value on the y-axis), we have a couple of choices:
We could use padding-left and padding-right. Fine, but longer than our original shorthand.
.box--some-variant {
  padding-right: 2rem;
  padding-left: 2rem;
}
We could use the shorthand, but remembering to include our original values.
.box--some-variant {
  padding: 1rem 2rem;
}
I’m not a huge fan of having to repeat the original value for the y-axis padding. We could abstract those values out into custom properties — something like this:
.box {
  padding: var(--py, 1rem) var(--px, 1rem);
}
.box--some-variant {
  --px: 2rem;
}
On the other hand, there is a logical property that enables us to adjust the padding on a single axis: padding-inline refers to the padding on the x-axis when the document is in the left-to-right (default) or right-to-left writing mode. padding-block refers to the y-axis. (Those directions are reversed for a vertical writing mode.)
So instead we could write:
.box {
  padding: 1rem;
}
.box--some-variant {
  padding-inline: 2rem;
}
Codepen demo →
The same applies to margins, borders and a bunch of others. And check out the inset property for a great positioning shorthand!
Logical properties are very well supported in browsers now, so it’s a good time to start using them.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there, I am Honey - Co-founder at Locofy.
We, along with other makers, have been building Locofy.ai to help massively accelerate the builders - the designers, developers, product managers & founders, and we're excited to share it today with the HN Community.
Locofy.ai simply converts designs into production-ready frontend code for web and mobile apps. It adapts to your preferred design tools, tech stack, and workflows with ease and lets you launch upto 4x faster, while letting designers design the way they want and giving high-quality responsive code that developers love.
With this launch, you can convert your Figma designs into React, React Native, Next.js, Gatsby, and HTML-CSS code. You get a live-responsive prototype that runs on code (we call these ‘real-fidelity prototypes’) and when good to go, you can either export the code to build on top of it or directly deploy to Netlify, Vercel, or Github.
Today, we have also launched on Product Hunt. Let us know your thoughts and suggestions: https://www.producthunt.com/posts/locofy-ai.
Our team will be answering all your questions!

Serina Murphy
      My name is Serina Murphy and I’m currently a UI/UX Designer at Fear Free.



Tell us about your background and experience with design.
After spending a decade of proven success driving revenue in tech advertising (Yahoo!, Miniclip, Disney), I sought out a new career that leverages my creativity and experience in tech. I married two distinct areas of my educational background in occupational therapy (earning a Master’s degree) and UX design (completing a design bootcamp at Avocademy).

There are different ways of going about the frontend. In each case, elements specific to the logged-in-user and the related images get fetched via api calls and are rendered client side.
For rendering the rest of the page -
1. Everything is rendered client side - one can use a single page application to handle the routing. The page structure stays the same, and new image uri's and the associated content are fetched via api calls.
SEO is a priority, so pure client side rendering is suboptimal.
2. Server side rendering for each page with NextJS or even Express…]]></summary>

But I got it working!
Here’s how to get it running by removing the code signature.
The main clue came when I tried running it from the Terminal, to see if it
would show a more useful error. I got the same popup error, but also this:
rosetta error: /var/db/blahblah/SketchUp.aot: attachment of code signature supplement failed: 1
zsh: trace trap  /Applications/SketchUp\ 2017/SketchUp.app/Contents/MacOS/SketchUp

“attachment of code signature supplement failed”, eh?
We’ll just remove that code signature, then… from absolutely everything inside the app.
To do this, launch the Ter…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[User preference media features give you the ability to style web experiences that align with the user's own specific preferences and needs. In other words, preference media features allow you to adapt your user experiences to your user's expectations.


You can enhance the user experience of your website by taking the following three steps:
Discover the possibilities. Learn all the user preference media features.
Style your web experiences. Implement, for example, color, layout, and element size changes based on the preferences.
Test the UI. In DevTools, emulate the preferences and test how your website behaves.
DevTools supports a variety of emulation options. To help you avoid searching for and adjusting system and browser settings, all the emulation options reside in one place—under the Rendering tab in DevTools.
The emulation options of the user's preferences include but are not limited to:
prefers-color scheme—light or dark color scheme
prefers-contrast—lower or higher contrast
prefers-reduced-motion—minimize motion or not
prefers-reduced-data—consume less traffic or not
For a comprehensive list of all emulation options, see Emulate CSS media features.
To discover more effects you can apply using the Rendering tab, see the Rendering tab overview.
Additionally, with DevTools, your testing capabilities aren't limited to the single device you're working on. You can Simulate mobile devices with Device Mode.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bootstrap Icons v1.9.0 is here with over 140 new and updated icons, including some longstanding requests for new brands, transportation options, numbers and letters, and so much more. With this release, we’re now at over 1,800 icons!
140+ new icons
Here’s a quick look at all the new icons in v1.9.0:



Tons of new brand icons including popular browsers, Ubuntu, Google Play, Android, Dropbox, and many more.
New transportation icons including cars, trains, planes, fuel, and common road signs.
New number and letter icons for 1-9, R, C, CC, H, and P (for use cases like registered trademark, copyright, Creative Commons, hospital or helicopter, and parking).
New medical icons for prescriptions, pills, and viruses.
New keyboard icons for tab and escape.
New Universal Access cions.
Redrawn cup icon, now with a steam variant for hot beverages.
Fire, finally!
There are a handful more in there as well, so have a look and put them to use in your next update! In addition, we’ve updated our docs to include mention of Composer installs.
Looking for more new icons? Head to the issue tracker to check for open requests or submit a new one.
Install
To get started, install or update via npm:
npm i bootstrap-icons


Or Composer:
composer require twbs/bootstrap-icons


You can also download the release from GitHub, or download just the SVGs and fonts (without the rest of the repository files).
Figma
The Figma file is now published to the Figma Community! It’s the same Bootstrap Icons Figma file you’ve seen from previous releases, just a little more accessible to those using the app.]]></summary>

New data tables needed to be created for the application too. The person that designed the application is not technical at all. They only designed the front-end and I designed the data model based off it.
I did the best I could with the information I had and we are slowly starting to see a working prototype, but there are still a lot of unanswered questions that I'm trying to figure out. The project is behind. I want to take responsibility for it being behind. But at the same time the project seems understaffed and it appears too much is being asked considering the size of the team.
What could I have done differently?

Sandbox", covering May and June 2022,
as we track the milestones on the path to phasing out third-party cookies in

# Privacy Sandbox Relevance and Measurement origin trial
We're continuing to run the combined origin trial for Attribution Reporting,
FLEDGE, and Topics, along with expanding it to include Fenced frames
and Shared Storage. Fenced frames provide a restricted container for
displaying content which FLEDGE makes use of to display ads. Shared Storage
complements fenced frames by allowing access to a carefully gated form of
unpartitioned storage where the stored data may be used as part of the ad

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32014658</id>
        <link href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32014658"/>
        <updated>2022-07-07T14:35:45.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for resources/tips on how to learn concepts in system design. Things around backend engineering and all the various components that go into building large scale systems (load balancing, message queues, CDNs, etc.). I'd also like to learn concepts around data like database sharding, non-relational database models, streaming/batch (lambda architecture, kappa architecture, etc.) and more.
In terms of what I've done so far...
I've read
- Designing Data Intensive Applications (https://dataintensive.net/) - This book has been recommended a ton on HN/twitter/reddit and I found it extremely useful to get a better idea of how data systems work, different types (OLAP vs. OLTP, data warehouse vs. lake, etc.) and get a better understanding of distributed systems.
- Quastor (https://www.quastor.org/) - This is a newsletter that sends out summaries of system design blog posts from Big Tech engineering blogs. It's been helpful to me for getting an understanding of the different components involved in the tech stacks at various companies and how companies think about building scalable systems.
- MIT Distributed Systems (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrw6a1wE39_tb2fErI4-W...) - This is a series of lectures by Robert Morris (co-founder of YC) on distributed systems and their properties. The lectures pick a specific tool/technology (Google File System, ZooKeeper, Apache Spark, etc.) and then discusses it. I've really enjoyed reading the papers and watching the lectures.
I'd really love any recommendations from the HN community on how else I should be learning about system design.
Thank you very much!

Are you looking for a UI as black as your coffee? Look no further. Dark mode, activate.
These low-light UIs are just what the doctor ordered whenever you need to get those creative juices flowing in the extra early or late hours. Use these picks to inspire your next dark mode UI design project or whenever you want to create something sleek. Even Batman would be impressed.
Nothing beats a good ole dark mode, from NFTs to banks to streaming to fitness. But remember, even if you’re not ready for the day, it cannot always be night 😉■

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I find myself lately gravitating back to older communities that survived the social media wave on the Internet because they seem to be a bit better at keeping track and promoting visibility of meaningful conversations, despite traditional functional flaws, screen sizing, and often dreadful large threaded views. I think a major strength is that most of these traditionally designed sites/apps still emphasize chronological order for content and posts, which makes the experience less prone to manipulation and more timely.
It also seems with older sites like HN and online bulletin boards, content can be bookmarked, and it's easier to correspond with users on a more regular basis. I think the most frustrating trend on modern sites and apps is that content I want to see simply disappears into a sea of other things I don't want to see, and that searching to find that content is futile, as results are often gamified and spammed into oblivion.
I miss IRC now, I miss bulletin boards despite all the flaws, I miss old school web sites that had the same content in the same place even after hitting refresh.
In my opinion, traditionally highly effective, favorable, and functional user-experience-based design has been thrown out the window lately as a trend; apps now are very often geared towards tracking, sponsored post placement, and profit/revenue optimization goals, rather than towards creating favorable user experiences.
It makes me wonder (despite some issues of course) if HN is still one of the best places to communicate and post serious matters BECAUSE it's UI/UX hasn't changed (In major ways) for many years?

The Dude Ranch and a horse named Tank
June kicked off with a rare family trip. My brother and his family came down from South Dakota and we all drove out to meet my mom and her husband in Bandera, TX for two days at Mayan Dude Ranch. Because we live all over the US, we haven’t done a trip with my mom and all the grandkids, and I’m glad we pulled it together.
One of the main attractions of the dude ranch is the cowboy’ing. Lasso classes, hatchet throwing, and trail rides everyday. You can even ride a horse to a chuck wagon breakfast.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I spoke about CSS layout at CSS Day conference recently, and in the Q&A session afterwards I was asked about masonry layout in CSS. Masonry layout, in case you’re not aware, is where different height items are laid out in columns but, rather than being aligned on the row axis, the items below effectively move up to plug any gaps, kind of like a bricklayer — hence the name. Pinterest’s grid design is a commonly-cited example whenever the masonry conversation comes up.
The current state of masonry in CSS
Currently we can build a kind of faux-masonry (or “fakesonry”, if you will) layout in CSS by using columns.
.list {
  columns: 20rem;
  column-gap: 1rem;
}

        <link href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31971019"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Which social media app do you think has the best design? This can include UX or UI design. Apparently most people don't pay attention to fonts, symbols and other stuff closely, but for those of us that do, which app speaks to you the most? This can really be any app, but preferably one of the more known social media apps.
For me, I've used Twitter probably the most by far, so I might be biased. They have a great black dark mode. The font is genuinely so cool. The high contrast labels and icons are so pleasing to look at.  The profile pages are cool and overall, the app layout makes the most sense to me in terms of the replies and features. Apparently Twitter is one of the more confusing apps to use, but Reddit is insanely confusing to me. When you look at social media and the internet overall, Twitter and Bootstrap seem to have had the biggest influence on app and website design, so many apps have similar features that Twitter does.
My least favorite is probably Reddit and Snapchat. Snapchat is pretty smooth to use, but the colors and bubble-like design just doesn't do it for me, and the profiles and searching thing is very confusing. Reddit is just a horrifically slow app and replies to posts are insanely annoying to sift through. I find myself closing every first tier replies so I can read replies instead if replies to replies. It's a confusing mess and there's just about nothing on the app that makes sense to me, which is interesting considering Quora, Twitter and Reddit are essentially the same thing and apparently had some of the same people on their design teams.
There's plenty of more stuff I like about Twitter, but the main thing is that fact that I prefer Twitter's design in general over other apps.
What about you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to know what documentation tools are people using to write software design docs. I have mostly seen that people use whichever general purpose Docs application is being used in their organization to write software docs too (Google Docs, Notion, etc).
If there was to exist a documentation software especially for software design documents, what features would be the most important? Are there any tools which do this well?
Also, as a software engineer, have you ever felt that the documentation software you use is lacking and does not help you communicate your ideas well, due to lack of native support for content like diagrams, schemas, state machines, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an old trick, but one I reach for just often enough to warrant a post on this blog — for no reason other than my own reference!
The problem
Suppose you have a page of content, all neatly constrained within a central wrapper. Probably using some kind of utility class, like so:
.wrapper {
  width: 70rem;
  max-width: 100%;
  margin-inline: auto;
}
(I’m using the margin-inline logical property as shorthand for margin-left and margin-right.)
But oh no! Suddenly you find yourself in need of a component that spans the full width of the page in the midst of your neatly constrained content. What to do? Well, there are a bunch of options.

Chrome DevTools is here to help you adopt new layout design patterns and stay on top of the latest trends. With the support of this CSS feature, you can now inspect and debug your container queries in DevTools.

Recently I came across SubReply[0], a social media site, and its CSS style is really nice. So nice that I decided to rip it and modified it to become a classless CSS style.
I spend about a few hours modding the CSS, removing/replacing class-based part, fixing bugs, and add additional features, such as custom blockquotes.
The style will needs some more work, but basically it has done what it needs to do.
I would love hearing your feedbacks and comments on the project!

Ah, social media. We’ve come a long way from Facebook 2008 to Instagram 2010 (remember Sierra or Mayfair filters, anyone?). In the past, posting 60-90 photos from a night out was acceptable, and uploading professional photos would almost instantly earn you 10K Instagram followers.
That’s enough reminiscing. Social media is now more popular than ever, so we need to be creative and intentional with the designs we choose.
These social media designs will catch your eye, whether creative wine club branding, plant, or puppy-themed posts. With posts like these, growing your (or your client’s) social audience will be a breeze. ■

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article was written by Lorelei Bowman from Maze—the product research platform for modern teams.
Consider the most useful and enjoyable products you use each day. It’s likely they all have one thing in common: they were designed with your needs in mind. Great products anticipate your needs—and their nuances—before you even have them. So, how can you achieve that when designing products?
The answer is simple: with the right research, at the right time in the design process.
In this article, we’ll cover what product research is and why it’s pivotal in your product’s success. We’ll go through each stage of the design process and delve into how to use research to guide and validate your ideas throughout.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I really enjoy it when I see programmers with a deranged disregard for aesthetics in the name of efficiency or productivity. Some of my favorited examples from my own experience:
- An extremely productive, like, 100x senior engineer I know works on a stock Ubuntu box with the default desktop wallpaper and an un-customized IntelliJ IDE and when he opens an IDE window he doesn't even full screen or center it. Just blasting code in an un-centered 68% width IDE.
- The smartest person I know (like, easily) uses the tcsh shell, the nvi editor, and the twm or ratpoision window manager, all ancient, unmaintained tools. I think they were the state of the art when he started using Unix and he never bothered switching.
- I saw a very clever bitcoin developer just set `contenteditable="true"` on an HTML element and use it as a text editor, I think because he already had the window open.
- Another developer I know with insane quality standards just names things "foo" when he can't think of a name for things, to the point where we worked on a project together for a month in a repo called "foo" until we came up with a name.
What are some good examples you've witnessed?
