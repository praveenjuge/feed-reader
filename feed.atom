Those of us who have worked on open source can spot it, burnout is afoot. The project got bigger than what the person or organization could realistically maintain. The maintainers are too busy or too burnt out to get the project back on track.
My open source burnout saga is pretty standard. My coworkers and I made a jQuery plugin that solved a hole in the web platform. It got pretty popular, and we made another one, and another one. Then the issues started pouring in; the surprise refactors, the undiscussed feature drops, the commit stat beefers, the good ideas I don’t have time for, the bad ideas I don’t know how to say “no” to, an…]]></summary>

The backend gets some really nice upgrades, especially with the encryption work that we did for HEY, so your data can be encrypted while its live in the database. At-work encryption, as we call it on the HEY security page.
But it's on the front end things have made a quantum leap. We've integrated the Hotwire frameworks of Stimulus and Turbo directly as the new defaults, together with that hot newness of import maps, which means you no longer need to run the whole JavaScript ecosystem enchilada in your Ruby app.
Turbo traces its roots back to 2012 with the first release of its predecessor Tur…]]></summary>

6 months ago I wrote about how 30-year-olds should basically go back to normal and no longer take many COVID precautions.
The holidays make this policy somewhat worse, because you can infect your family members. Further, vaccine efficacy has waned about 3x for most people since it’s been about six months since the vaccine wave. Some people have expressed concern about solstice in particular, which seems to turn out relatively safe. So let’s examine how you might navigate this.
The key takeaway is that a 1% chance of having COVID, which is about the base rate of COVID in the US, costs older relatives a few days of life if you pass it on to them. Thus, you should probably take a few easy actions beforehand to bring this down to a small number of ho…]]></summary>

When I was primarily writing tweets, I could easily involve myself in a dozen topics in a day. HERE'S A TAKE, THERE'S A TAKE, TAKE THAT! With email, it's a sliver of that.
But it goes even deeper than that. When there's no public outlet for all the possible takes, I've found that fewer takes actually develop. That it's possible to see a story float by and go "I don't need or want to assume even a mental position on this". It feels like the olden days, before we were all mined for opinions all day long by the platforms of engagement and enragement.
This is a helpful constriction in general, especially if you, like me, have a natural tendency to spontane…]]></summary>

For example, given a hypothetical API, `GET /widgets/:id` would return a generic set of properties for the widget... the id, location, parts, etc.
Whereas `POST /widgets` could return all of that, but in a scenario where it doesn't matter (that is, all the other values are null or defaults), then returning just `{ id }` would be sufficient.
Especially in the case of large response payloads, it may save some data from going over the wire, bu…]]></summary>

What is the Launch Handler API? #
There are many ways to launch a Progressive Web App. Probably the most common is via the icon on the
home screen or the app drawer of the device. But when you think about it, there are many other ways
a launch can happen:
A share action when the app is a
share target.
A user click in the file explorer opening the PWA, which
acts as a file handler.
A registered protocol handler that the PWA may launch as the
result of a matching protocol.
A click on a
push notification or an app icon shortcut.
There are even more ways, but you get the idea. Given the manifold possibilities for launching PWAs,

I don't just mean that in a general sense. That other peoples at other times have faced crippling polarization, societal upheaval, and political distress. No, that the very battlegrounds of thought are the same. Not similar, but the same.
William Buckley's show The Firing Line is a treasure trove in this regard.

It starts out by debunking the common myth that prior to coinage, everyone were trapped in this inefficient mode of barter.

If you had a chicken to give and wanted sugar from Gandalf, but Gandalf was a vegetarian, you had to first trade your chicken to Frodo, who’d give you the barley, that Gandalf wanted for his sugar.

This is how mosts economists from Adam Smith forward have described what they imagined the primitive, inefficient barter economies prior to the advent of coinage looked like. It’s a great sales pitch for modern commerce, but unfortunately, as Graeber details, it’s also mostly made-up bullshit.

Another example: Most devs that I know prefer CLI over GUI, even when GUI makes their life easier.
I'm not saying pragmatic design doesn't have its place, but too much minimalism and simplicity is also not good IMO. In the HN example, some simple JS elements or better CSS wouldn't hurt.

Last year I discovered, much to my chagrin, that always-on internet socializing was costly for me. This was inconvenient both because I’d spent rather a lot of time singing the praises of social media and instant messaging, and because we were in the middle of a global pandemic that had made online socializing an almost physical necessity. I made the decision at the time to put off changing my social media diet, and that was correct. But now there is in-person socializing again, and I’m changing how I use social media and messaging. I wanted to talk about this process and how great it was for me, but kept being nagged by the thought that the internet was full of essays about how the internet is bad, all of which I ignored or actively fought with,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month I wrote about writing on web.dev. At that time, the first five parts of a fifteen-part course on responsive design had been published. I’m pleased to say that the next five parts are now available. They are:
Typography
Responsive images
The picture element
Icons
Theming
It wasn’t planned, but these five modules feel like they belong together. The first five modules were concerned with layout tools—media queries, flexbox, grid, and even container queries. The latest five modules are about the individual elements of design—type, colour, and images. But those elements are examined through the lens of responsiveness; responsive typography with clamp, responsive colour with prefers-color-scheme, and responsive images with picture and srcset.
The final five modules should be available later this month. In the mean time, I hope you like the first ten modules.]]></summary>

Right now my plan is to build an MVP, apply to YC and then maybe keep Dart long term. Also, Our team is more familiar with Dart than React. We need a language which can work cross platform and is simpler to implement features.
Thoughts.

I've listened to maybe a dozen shows, and the way he lets his guests talk, at length, feels like a throwback. It doesn't have the intellectualism of a Bryan Magee or the inquisitiveness of a William Buckley, but it does have the spirit of letting people – with whom he, his audience, and others might disagree – present their thoughts in full. In our age, and a stage the size of Rogan's, that feels quaint. Where are the fast jabs? The quick dunks? The stupefied facial expression?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a given that Facebook, Twitter, et al, are designed to monopolize people's attention and energy. This is obviously not great when a lot of public discourse (or attempts at it) happen on these platforms.
I've seen several submissions by HNers working on 'friendlier' social media platforms, but is there academic research being done on what features would constitute a human-centric social media? By human-centric I mean a space designed to encourage thoughtful communication, to the extent that it can, and one that does not exploit the properties of human brains to form addictions to said platform.
This seems like it ought to be an active area of research. I've tried googling, but all that comes up for the terms I can think of is articles on how to use social media for marketing.

Chen Hui Jing is a self-taught designer and developer living in Singapore, with an inordinate love for CSS, as evidenced by her blog (which is mostly about CSS) and her tweets (which are largely about typography and the web). She used to play basketball full-time and launched her web career during downtime between training sessions, and hopes to be able to climb outdoors one day. I talked to her about CSS, and in particular non-English writing systems.

Go Easy on the Multitasking


We’ll state for the record that we think multitasking is a great skill that every person should cultivate. It can come in handy when you’re in a tight pinch and need to think on the fly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are designing Identity and Access management for our Application. 
We have different org using our app. Each org may have some sub orgs. Users belong to one or more sub orgs.
A user can have different roles in each sub org.
E.g a user U1 belong to Org O1 / Sub Org SB1 and Org O1 / Sub Org SB2.
Now user can have Admin role in SB1 and Non-Admin role in SB2.
Now when a U1 logins, user needs to select which sub org he wants to operate in and accordingly all roles will be fetched.
In standard RBAC, we can link user to multiple roles but that will give user all permissions in all those roles. In our case we want to ties user to multiple roles but those roles exist in different contexts SB1 and SB2. So we do not want combined evaluation of permissions from both roles.
Also we want to define permissions assigned to each role at one place only.
Is there any proven extensible design to serve these kind of use cases?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chrome has launched a fund to support the UI ecosystem. We designed this fund to provide grants to people who work on design tools, CSS, and HTML.
All of us who work on the web regularly benefit from the work of people who create specifications, tools, demos, tutorials, and polyfills. Many of these resources are side projects, made available and supported free of charge. They exist because someone saw a need, created something to meet it, then shared it with the rest of the ecosystem.
We want to recognize and help support this work and invest in the CSS ecosystem. We're excited to enable people to spend time on these projects and create more value for the web.

First of all, the fact that all this footage exists is remarkable. It’s as if Disney had announced that they’d found the footage for a film shot between Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back.
Still, does this treasure trove really warrant the daunting length of this new Beatles documentary? As Terence puts it:
There are two problems with this Peter Jackson documentary. The first is that it is far too long - are casual fans really going to sit through 9 hours of a band bickering? The second problem is that it is far too short! Beatles obsessives (like me) could happily drink in a hundred hours of this stuff.
In some ways, watching Get Back is liking watching one of those Andy Warhol art projects where he just po…]]></summary>

The goal of this essay is to help you understand EfficientZero, a reinforcement learning agent that obtains better-than-human median performance on a set of 26 Atari games after just two hours of real-time experience playing each game.
Specifically, it gets 116% of human median performance on the data-limited Atari 100k benchmark. The previously-best algorithm only reached about 41% of median human performance, so this is a reasonably large leap.
Chart stolen from paper

The benchmark is called 100k because agents only interact with the environment for 100,000 steps -- about two hours.  Note also that the human benchmarks were also set after the humans in question had about two hours of experience on the game.  So EfficientZero seems to -- at lea…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello.
This year I dived into UI/UX area and at the same time I work as a web developer. I sincerely love making good UI. But at my full time job it's not always possible due to different reasons =\
So I've been posting random UI/UX staff on Twitter, then I made a free book that had 50 tips (posted it here as well).
I decided to finish this year by collecting everything I learned and here it is: https://akcium.gumroad.com/l/ui-ux-tips.
This time it's a paid one. But, you can check ~20 pages of it, just go to https://akcium.gumroad.com/l/ui-ux-tips-sample, put 0 in the price and download it for free.
I tried to illustrate almost every tip and provide some additional links.
This is especially useful for devs and founders who cannot afford a designer or just want to make their UI look decent.

Bramus: As a kid, I always liked to tinker with things. I would spend days playing with my LEGO® bricks, building my own fantasy world and objects from scratch.
When we got a computer at home—an unusual device to own in the 1990s—I soon traded in the physical toys with computer games. I wasn't an avid gamer though; I don't think I ever finished a game entirely. Instead of finishing the games, I found myself modding them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I teach a college-level intro to html/css/js to mostly business majors. We can get by with VSCode doing livereload on a single machine or liveshare on multiple machines, but not both because Univ IT blocks liveshare's public port broadcast. Teaching them Git would burn 1-2 class sessions, but might be worth it -- not sure.
Is there a way to satisfy these reqs?
1. Provides live-sharing (2+ students code from separate machines in the same file)
2. Supports auto-reload on each machine without public port binding (Univ IT blocks port broadcast)
3. Is an IDE or IDE extension
4. Keeps some sort of version history
5. Syncs a local copy of the files on each machine* (nice to have)

But the trolls never came. Since we launched HEY World, every single one of the many thousands of posts made here have had a "report abuse" link at the bottom. Not once has it been used to report a posting that actually violated our use restrictions. Not. Once.
All that worry, all that consternation, all those arguments back and forth about policy and protocols, all for nothing.
Furthermore, HEY World is a pretty minimalist system. By design. The individual pages contain just five links: Link to the au…]]></summary>

every year towards the end of it I want to remind you that if you like my work, you can help financing this newsletter by giving a contribution. At this point I want to say thank you to every single reader, to everyone who supports me, sends me feedback or suggestions. I love this project so much because my readership (you!) is so amazing.
When I looked up something these days in my archive, I realised how true the introduction from last year is still today.
On the topic of creating for the web: I personally think micro-typography, good translations and good content writing matters a lot to the success of a product. So I wrote an article on well crafted translations and why automation isn’t good enough yet, showing some prominent examples that just aren’t good enough.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An interesting notification from @cyishere popped up in my Twitter feed the other day:
I use a Chrome extension Read Aloud to read the web pages for improving my English. The reading voice for most web pages is American accent, but when it reads @CSSInRealLife, it switches to British, which is very interesting.😁
— CY is here 👩🏻‍💻🚀🖖🏻 (@cyishere) November 29, 2021
 
I replied that I thought this was likely due to the page’s lang attribute, which on this site is en-GB — British English. The default for many frameworks is en, American English. While there might not be huge differences between the two, it can affect how certain words are pronounced to assistive technologies such as screenreaders. (You can read more about the lang attribute on MDN.) Of course, it would have a much bigger impact on web pages that are in a different language altogether, so you should always make sure you change it to the appropriate value!
The experience shared by @cyishere serves an important reminder that people browse the web in all sorts of ways we might not be aware of when building our sites, and we should make sure we build with that flexibility in mind. While it’s easy to see this unknowability as a hindrance, I believe that it’s something to be embraced. In building for the web, we have the opportunity to deliver content to users in a way that suits them, and the web platform provides us with all sorts of features in HTML and CSS that help us do that. Starting with semantic HTML and layering on top with progressive enhancement is a solid strategy.
Speaking of the lang attribute reminded me of Manuel Matuzović’s excellent article analysing his HTML boilerplate. It contains tons of useful information about many of the elements and attributes most of us don’t give much thought to day-to-day if, like Manuel, we recycle the same boilerplate from project to project. It’s well worth a read.]]></summary>

These dark emotions are then propelled by the particle accelerator that is Twitter into super-charged takes. All that energy has definitively nuked any previous utopian hope that "connecting the world" would lead to peace, love, and understanding.
That, ironically, is perhaps the one thing everyone does seem to agree on at the moment: social media is making everything political worse. But of course such a conclusion is only shared until the question of who to blame emerges or what to do about it is brought up, and then it's back to the tribal drums.

The procedure involved cutting away 1mm layers of flesh at the tumor site and looking at each layer under a microscope, repeating the process until there’s no cancer detected. Thankfully we got it in one go. But because this is my nose, you can’t graft a piece of butt cheek on there to patch it up, we had to borrow skin from other parts of my nose and sew it all up. It looks like I got into a fight, but it seems to have gone well. Still don’t know what the final product will look like, but I’m glad it’s over for now becuase that was a lot of ambient anxiety hanging over me.

TLDR

There’s an organization based in London called the Rationalist Association. It was founded in 1885. Historically, it focused on publishing books and articles related to atheism and science, including works by Darwin, Bertrand Russell, J. B. S. Haldane, George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, and Karl Popper.
The topics covered overlap with the present-day rationalist movement (centered on Lesswrong). They include religion and atheism, philosophy (especially philosophy of science and ethics), evolution, and psychology.
According to Wikipedia, membership of the Rationalist Association peaked in 1959 with more than 5000 members and with Bertrand Russell as President.
This post displays some covers of Rationalist Association publications, and links t…]]></summary>

These days, you have RA3. RA3 has data slices and compute slices. The “data slice” I think is a group of one or more network attached SSDs, and each compute slice is an EC2 instance. Data is still distributed over slices, but I empirically see now that any slice on a node can access any block which is on that node - that’s definitely not how it used to be.
So I think what happens now is SSD is on the network, which is now a notional “data slice”, but there’s only one data slice per “node” (you don’t really have nodes any more - it’s more of a legacy billing concept), and you have a cloud of EC2 ins…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2013 Chong-U Lim wrote a research paper for MIT wordily titled Modeling Player Performance in Avatar Customization Using Social Network Data: A Case Study Using Virtual Items in Team Fortress 2. It’s all about the correlation between in-game loot —digital items people win or buy on the Steam marketplace— and player’s social status in an online competitive game called Team Fortress 2. What a phenomenal research topic! It’s a dense paper, so thankfully Tommy Thompson at the AI & Games YouTube channel breaks it down.
One interesting piece was how the study talks about players creating a “phantasmal identity” —a projection of real-world human ideas onto a digital avatar— and how the player’s identity is often projected in a “ridiculous and exaggerated fashion”. A machine learning model was able to classify and predict (with ~60% accuracy) a player’s social status (social interactions) based on their status performance (value of in-game hats). I think about this often, because it’s a fascinating look at the relationship between digital cosmetics (hats, skins, avatars, sprays) and social status broadcasting. Louis Vuitton, but Loot Boxes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know what it is about cooking and recipe-focused websites. They seem to be some of the worst in terms of pop ups, and superfluous garbage content. I spend so much time searching for the actual content on most pages because there are so many links to other crap.
For example, check out this Betty Crocker page where there's about 300px of whitespace at the top, a huge useless picture of flour, and a navbar that doesn't quite stick to the top of the page (viewing on Firefox) https://www.bettycrocker.com/how-to/tipslibrary/charts-timetables-measuring/equivalent-measures-abbreviations
Another example is allrecipes.com. I think it fares pretty well on Desktop, but on my phone I notice they insert adds throughout the ingredient list and instructions. Also met with a full-screen popup from Amazon about Cyber Monday.
There's gotta be some plain and simple sites out there, and I'd like to hear about them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok so the high level breakdown:
1. Read and do the problems for the first half of the book. Do not rush this part of the process.
2. Skip the second half of the book when the chapters switch to being real world examples
3. Having trouble on a particular section? Watch the youtube video to get a cleaner read: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22hwcnXIGgk&list=PLOtl7M3yp-DX6ic0HGT0PUX_wiNmkWkXx
4. Don't spend too much time on NP/NP-Complete/NP-Hard topics
5. Over learn chapter 2. This is arguably the most important chapter having a deep understanding of runtime analysis helps you in every other chapter and on the interview
6. Don't spend too much time on writing proofs in Chapter 1. Understand them and be able to work through them and understand how the math comes together, but writing a specific proof isn't too valuable. 
7. Sometimes the interview problems at the end of the chapter are silly. If it feels dumb, example: 1.36. How much does the ice in a hockey rink weigh? Skip it. These are older school programming interview questions and have been largely phased out
Ultimately I feel like this book is the best resource for big tech interview prep, and I want to help my students spend their time as efficiently as possible. If anyone has additional advice or feedback on how I can improve this list, I'd love to hear it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN:
I have been developing apps for iOS and Android for about 10 years. Started with Objective C and Java and then moved to Swift and Kotlin. I don't have much web dev experience though (mostly vanilla JS) but do have lots of mobile dev and backend dev experience in node js and bit of Rust.
Have you switched from native to cross platform dev?
Have you tried both flutter and react native?
Which one did you prefer and why?
Thanks!
Edit: I did start learning flutter yesterday and it seems pretty decent so far. 2 problems I do have are:
1. Too must nesting (which some say can be solved by breaking down everything into smaller widgets but seems like a lot of extra code work).
2. Flutter for web dev is absolute trash and useless as it seems to just draw the content using canvas instead of actually creating the html tree.

I’m an independent researcher working on AI alignment and the theory of agency. I’m 29 years old, will make about $90k this year, and set my own research agenda. I deal with basically zero academic bullshit - my grant applications each take about one day’s attention to write (and decisions typically come back in ~1 month), and I publish the bulk of my work right here on LessWrong/AF. Best of all, I work on some really cool technical problems which I expect are central to the future of humanity.

Read more about RSS Club.

Twitter has been fever-pitched about Web3, blockchain, and NFTs. It’s made it an unenjoyable place for me as more and more people I follow chase the money over to Web3. Everything is getting an NFT feature: Twitter, Discord, Reddit, Disney+, Star Trek; it’s exhausting.
I spent a lot of time and emotional well-being last month thinking (aka “doing my own research”) about Web3 and NFTs. I’m not morally opposed to ledger-like problems that blockchain can solve and DAOs even sound great; but the surface area for criminal activity, unregulated markets, no consumer protection, fake scarcity to drive up values, low-quality art being cheaply made selling at inflated values, thousands of 500 watt GPUs glowing in a basement in Iowa destroying the environment for a profile picture… Ugh.
NFTs are sucking the air out of everything… both literally and figuratively.
Two weeks ago I uninstalled Twitter from my devices. Waking up in the morning I’m no longer greeted with a million angry voices. No faux conservative outrage, no reactive liberal outrage. It can all be undone in an instant, but right now I’m unplugged from the infernal machine and it feels unsettingly quiet.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a fan of logical properties in CSS. As I wrote in the responsive design course on web.dev, they’re crucial for internationalisation.
Alaa Abd El-Rahim has written articles on CSS tricks about building multi-directional layouts and controlling layout in a multi-directional website. Not having to write separate stylesheets—or even separate rules—for different writing modes is great!
More than that though, I think understanding logical properties is the best way to truly understand CSS layout tools like grid and flexbox.
It’s like when you’re learning a new language. At some point your brain goes from translating from your mother tongue into the other language, and instead starts thinking in that other language. Likewise with CSS, as some point you want to stop translating “left” and “rig…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working with web testing frameworks (Selenium and its wrappers / Cypress / Puppeteer / Playwright / others) for the last few years, but I asked myself what "frameworks of the future" should look like. I found myself not wanting things too wild or different from what we have today - just incremental improvements. Is that objectively true? What, if anything, is the next leap forward? Or are we close to them being "good enough" for the most part?
My top "problems", in some shape or form, from existing products:
- Be faster to complete builds
- Have fewer false positives (or do accurate self-healing magic)
- Be easier to get started with (or be optionally codeless like Selenium IDE)
- Don't be a walled garden (what if I want to run the same logical 'test' across Playwright and Cypress)
- Help me write better tests (or be difficult to write bad tests within)
- Emulate mobile devices better than just viewport modification
What do the HN folks think?

This is an essay describing a basic sanity-inducing mental movement that I use approximately ten times per week, and suspect other people would benefit from adopting (and regularly reminding each other to do). I've talked about it elsewhere, but until now it didn't have its own linkable reference post.

P1: Things are often not what they seem.
This can be because the seeming itself is broken, e.g. the progression that goes:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not only my first step, but what's the path which I should follow in order to become good at designing my own UI/UX for my products?
I am currently a full stack web developer, and I mostly use templates / pre-made components when working on projects, but I want to start doing my own custom designs.
I am sure that I need to learn the basics of UI/UX design first, then move to a tool such as Figma / XD / Sketch.
But the number of resources online is just too much, I can't weed out the bad ones, and I can't figure out a clear roadmap for myself on how to appraoch my journey?
Your input on the subject would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It used to be fairly easy to find an entry point into that most-helpful UI in one of "my repositories", or that of a third-party, by selecting a non-main branch at the top-level of a repo's GitHub Web UI, then clicking the Contribute dropdown on the far-right of that element, and then clicking Compare.
From there, one could play with the base and compare dropdowns.
Of late, I find it's completely hit-or-miss, regardless of the browser, and regardless of that browser's regular vs. private mode (if it has that distinction).
Anyone else experienced similar? I've found it quite disruptive the past several days, but maybe it's just me?

At the beginning of 2020, the Chrome team across mobile and desktop
laid out a plan to improve the discoverability and engagement of
installed web apps. Our work led to a greater than 100% increase in
PWA installation and engagement. We achieved this by researching
existing features, running A/B test experiments and user interviews
to gain insight into users perceptions and expectations. This article
covers how we got there.
# Unified install language
The call-to-action that triggers a PWA install was inconsistent across
the web platform. For Chrome on Android, we had settled on Add to
home screen, but on our Desktop Platforms, we
emphasized Install. The rationale for this discrepancy came from
a study the team ran in 2016 that compared different strings. The
team found that…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29313055"/>
        <updated>2021-11-22T23:55:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roughly once a week, HN will feature a link to a new web-based UI framework/toolkit. These seem to build upon a history that, briefly stated, seems to go: HTML -> HTML5 -> JS -> Node -> React -> [ a lot of stuff ]. Obviously there are things that branched off at various points along the way.
As a purely native desktop application developer, whenever I read about these frameworks, they seem to contain almost no trace of any of the programming models/designs/lessons that were learned between (say) 1980 and 2005 in the domain of native GUI toolkits (both platform-specific and cross-platform). There's almost no trace of any of the vocabulary, but also very little sign of any of the fundamental concepts (widgets, "classic" MVC, etc.)
So I'm asking without (much) predjudice: what's so different about UI/UX in web-dev that justifies throwing away all these design lessons? Or are they really still in modern web frameworks and I'm just not seeing them?

But fear not - there are many ways to increase your motivation levels and keep them high all day long.


In this article, I will explore ways to keep motivation high and bounce back from setbacks; these methods are psychology-proven to work in any situation. Let's dive deep into this topic. 


Consider Your Reason(s) Why 


One of the best ways to motivate yourself is by considering your "why." What do we mean by that? Think about why you want to achieve a certain goal. "But, what if I don't know why?" you might ask.


Well, there's a way for you to find your motivation and discover your true "why."

Chrome 97 beta was released on November 18, 2021 and is expected to become the
stable version in late December, 2021.
# Remove SDES key exchange for WebRTC
The SDES key exchange mechanism for WebRTC has been declared a MUST NOT in the
relevant IETF standards since 2013. The SDES specification has been declared
historic by the IETF. Its usage in Chrome has declined significantly over the
recent year. Consequently it is
removed as of Chrome
97.
# Remove WebSQL in third-party contexts
WebSQL in third-party contexts is now removed.
The Web SQL Database standard was first proposed in April 2009 and abandoned in
November 2010. Gecko never implemented this feature and WebKit deprecated it in
2019. The W3C encourages

Whilst I'm here in the real world, my blog will exist in the digital world, and every single post URL will work (404s are for the weak! 😏).
Back in 2015 I set myself an goal to publish at least two posts a month, for the most part I've managed. I've always been a fan of "easy goals" - something that's achievable without it causing stress - so doing some writing twice a month definitely hit that sweet spot.
This particular blog has been active since 2006, but I had also toyed with more diary-like sites during the early-2000s but the URLs are so obscure not only has the web forgotten, but they're wiped clean from my own memory.

Container logistics is an interesting but complicated topic, with a lot of implicit knowledge kept by industry insiders. In this post, I'll give a brief overview, based on my experiences having worked in the industry for three different shipping companies (all located in Chile) over a period of five years. Hopefully, this will allow people to get more accurate models of the heavy port congestion in Long Beach that has been theorized about extensively here on LW. I can't comment on circumstances specific to that port or the US more generally; but there's a set of underlying intuitions that should give people a solid, universal foundation to think about the issue. Based on those intuitions, I think people are way too optimistic about simple and eas…]]></summary>

What's distracting about it? Maybe something's too colorful. Maybe it's something regarding the layout. Maybe it's the ordering of elements, or the size or proportion of something related to something else. Maybe it's a specific animation. Maybe it's even a sound generated by a specific action, button press, or gesture.
So what do you do? You look, you consider. But when you're staring at the thing that prompted the feedback, it's common to narrow your focus until only the  offending element is in view. Essentially, when someone says "it's this t…]]></summary>

From raster to vector #
Have you ever scaled an image and the result was pixelated and unsatisfactory? If
so, you have probably dealt with a raster image format such as WebP, PNG, or JPG.
          
  
    Scaling up a raster image makes it look pixelated.
  

In contrast, vector graphics are images that are defined by points in a coordinate system. These
points are connected by lines and curves to form polygons and other shapes. Vector graphics have an
advantage over raster graphics in that they may be scaled up or down to any resolution
without pixelation.

This post is the first in a series of transcribed Discord conversations between Richard Ngo and Eliezer Yudkowsky, moderated by Nate Soares. We've also added Richard and Nate's running summaries of the conversation (and others' replies) from Google Docs.

The transcripts are a complete record of several Discord channels MIRI made for discussion. We tried to edit the transcripts as little as possible, other than to fix typos and a handful of confusingly-worded sentences, to add some paragraph breaks, and to add referenced figures and links.

In case of conflict, consider users over authors over implementors over specifiers over theoretical purity.
It’s all about priorities, see?
Prioritisation isn’t easy, and it gets harder the more factors come into play: user needs, business needs, technical constraints. But it’s worth investing the time to get agreement on the priority of your constituencies. And then formulate that agreement into design principles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The way to work without regrets is to pursue projects that'll have been worth your time even if they don't pan out. Projects that'll tickle your curiosity, flex your competency, and teach you something new regardless of where they ultimately end up. Projects that leave you better off, as a person, despite not being a commercial or critical success. If you work on projects like this, it's impossible to waste your time.
My personal nightmare is investing years of my life into something that ends up going nowhere, and then feeling like it was all for nothing. That's how life slips through your fingers. That's how you cross over from your 20s to your 30s and curse what you missed along the way because the bet didn't pay out.
When you look for projects that'll be worth it even if they don't work, you know you'll engage the fires of intrinsic motivation. Tap into the magic of flow. Look with satisfaction at a good day's work, well before you're done.
That's a work of meaning.]]></summary>

The trouble with time The current way to manage dates and times in JavaScript is with the Date() object. It’s pretty ok, but it’s not great.
It has methods for creating a Date() object from a string, formatting dates and times, and getting back specific values. But it lacks native methods to add or subtract time from a date.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few questions for anyone at Spotify:
- Why isn't there a list of new episodes from podcasts you follow? (This should be MVP- absolutely every other podcast service i know of has this!)
- How exactly am I supposed to use the "your episodes" playlist?
- Why don't podcasts always sort correctly when you go to a podcast list? 
- Why can't I search within an artist's page? even if it's limited to their discography?
- Why can't there be a separate list item in the sidebar for podcasts, artists and albums?
- Why can't I get to the "find podcasts" area from the library (or the your episodes area)? this used to exist!
- in the podcasts section in your library, why can't I sort by most recently updated?
I get why Spotify is pushing podcasts so hard, but why not implement some absolutely basic features?
Phone issues:
- Why does it take so long (if it even shows up) for downloaded podcasts to show up when you're offline?
    - what's the point of downloading them if they won't show up?!?!?!?!?!
