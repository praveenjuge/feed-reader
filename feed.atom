Maybe I’m affected by me growing up in an an unprecedented part of history, where the entire human knowledge is available through the click of a button. This has a number of key implications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A friend of mine is pissed off.
He hired someone to replace a bunch of windows at his house.
The guy did the work. Poorly. And now it turns out he needs to have everything redone. Given how badly the job went, he's going to work with someone else to get it done right the second time.
What's there isn't really salvageable. Even the windows themselves need to be reordered.
It's a big number, it's real money.
He's going to try to get some money back from the original guy who messed up the job, but it's a long road. Outcomes unknown.
So he's staring at a big loss. He called me to talk about it.
He asked me if I've ever experienced something like this, and how I coped with it.
I absolutely have, and I've always found that how you frame it has a huge impact on how you feel about it. It allows you to move on.
I told him the way I've approached this sort of thing in the past is to frame it as "overall, this job cost more than I expected", rather than "This guy fucked me, I'm out $X, and now I have to pay someone else $Y more to redo it".
Yes, the total is the same, but one involves loss while the other involves missed expectations. I find it a lot easier to deal with underestimating total cost than feeling like I got screwed. Construction projects frequently go over budget. People deal with this all the time. The community is large! You're a member now.
Loss aversion is of course how it's described, but applying technical definitions doesn't often change how you feel. Being able to reframe it does.]]></summary>

The mind is divided, like a rider on an elephant, and the rider’s job is to serve the elephant. The rider is our conscious reasoning—the stream of words and images of which we are fully aware. The elephant is the other 99 percent of mental processes—the ones that occur outside of awareness but that actually govern most of our behavior.

It's the same underlying premise to Julia Galaef's book The Scout Mindset. We launder our arguments and reasoning through the tribal wash. Which is made easier by the fact that many valiant principles are in opposition to each other, and that you can often…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[2021 was an incredible year for Ruby on Rails. We started it off still celebrating the third major version of Ruby, and left it with the accomplishment of the seventh major version of Rails. Together, these releases sparked a renewed enthusiasm for building modern web applications with Ruby on Rails, unlike anything I can recall since the late oughts. The moment was finally right, and we were right for the moment.

But it should! 30-40% of web pages have a <canvas> element and 98% of all canvases use a Canvas2D rendering context.
There are Canvas2Ds in cars, on fridges, and in space (really).
Admittedly, the API is a bit behind the times when it comes to state-of-the-art 2D drawing.
Fortunately we've been hard at work implementing new features in Canvas2D to catch up to CSS, streamline ergonomics and improve performance.
# Part 1: catching up with CSS
CSS has a few drawing commands that are sorely missing from Canvas2D. With the new API we've added a handful of the most requested features:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here’s something I’ve been mulling around. Often in programming you hit a situation where you have to choose two paths:
The 15 minute fix
The 30 day fix (+30 days of repercussions)
I know, I know, that’s a gross generalization but it’s related to the tension between speed and sustainability in software development. I’ll explain a bit further…
The 15 minute fix
The fifteen minute fix is the most direct way to solve the problem. A hard-coded value, installing a third-party library, adding another prop, or introducing a manual process to get the job done. You don’t have time to find the right abstraction, to write it yourself, think through all the edge cases, or automate the process. But deep in the back of your mind, you know that you made a compromise…
Sometimes the compromise is worth it.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, my web friend Sara Soueidan tweeted out a poll…
 Do you use Progressive Enhancement (PE) to build your Web products? If you don’t, do you mind sharing the reason(s) why?
 A shocking 36.8 percent of respondents said they didn’t know what progressive enhancement was! Another 13.5 percent said they don’t use it.
So today, we’re going to talk about Progressive Enhancement, the New Hotness™.
Let’s dig in!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If your existence is all about work, and work goes to shit, then life goes to shit too. If you live for your hobby, and your hobby hits the wall, then your life crashes too. If everything else is waiting until you hang with your mates, and your mates fade away, then you fade too. Betting your drive to get up in the morning on a single path will leave you completely stuck if that one road is blocked.
Don't bet all your happiness and purpose on a single square. 
It's fine to lean on one pillar or another at different times in your life, but you'd do well to make sure there's a few others holding up the roof if the first one crumbles. Yes, rock it out at work, but reserve some evenings and weekends for a hobby too. Sure, enjoy that tight-knit crew, but realize that life eventually changes for them some day as well.
Diversification is resilience in action. It's having something in reserve. It's knowing that everyone, everywhere, doing anything, will eventually suffer setbacks, frustration, and despair. And planning for that by packing a bag with more than just hammers.
It doesn't have to be 33/33/33, but you aren't prepared for the likely life if it's 90/5/5. And it won't help you that one in a hundred can hit glory for a while betting it all on 100/0/0. You'll only ever see their highlight reel, and you'll never see the other ninety-nine who crashed and burned.
Diversify your life.]]></summary>

Courses have been helpful, but it seems that no matter the course, I do my best learning by making things myself. So I’ve been tinkering around and trying to build some new projects.
My latest experiment was to build something that allows me to toggle a class on an element with a particular id.

<button type="button" data-toggle-target="#example" data-toggle-class="blue">
  Toggle
</button>

<div id="example">
  This element will have the <code>.blue</code> class toggled on it.
</div>


The gist is that I want to use a <button> to toggle any class I want on another element of my choosing, all using data attributes so that it’s infinitely flexible and functional in any context.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know a bit about Japanese folk music (民謡), but Pete Seeger opened my eyes to and old song called  “Genbaku O Yurusumaji (Forgive us the atom bomb)”, an anti-nuclear Japanese dirge.
Born in the US in the cold war, it never seemed necessary to establish an anti-nuclear stance. It just was. A threat deterrent as much as a threat. Or so we told ourselves. Moving to Japan and witnessing Hiroshima changed that for me. The perspective the Japanese have changes your perspective.
With the current threat of atomic warfare, this song has been on my mind.

ふるさとの街やかれ
身よりの骨うめし焼土に
今は白い花咲く
ああ許すまじ原爆を    
三度許すまじ原爆を    
われらの街に

ふるさとの海荒れて
黒き雨喜びの日はなく
今は舟に人もなし
ああ許すまじ原爆を
三度許すまじ原爆を
われらの海に

ふるさとの空重く
黒き雲今日も大地おおい
今は空に陽もささず
ああ許すまじ原爆を
三度許すまじ原爆を
われらの空に

はらからのたえまなき
労働にきずきあぐ富と幸
今はすべてついえ去らん
ああ許すまじ原爆を
三度許すまじ原爆を
世界の上に

The city of my hometown
We buried the charred bones of our relatives
White flowers are blooming now
Oh forgive the nuclear bomb
Forgive the nuclear bomb three times
In our city

The sea of my hometown is rough
There is no day of joy in black rain
There are no people in the boats now
Oh forgive the nuclear bomb
Forgive the nuclear bomb three times
In our sea

The sky of my hometown
Black clouds, the earth is covered today
Now the sun isn't in the sky
Oh forgive the nuclear bomb
Forgive the nuclear bomb three times
In our sky

No praise from the belly
Wealth and happiness is labor
I can't leave everything now
Oh forgive the nuclear bomb
Forgive the nuclear bomb three times
On top of the world]]></summary>

Recently I’ve been thinking quite a bit about third-party scripts and how much bloat they so often add to the average webpage — and, consequently, their impact on climate change via the additional carbon emissions generated, often for something the end user doesn’t really want or need. Third-party scripts can include ads, trackers, analytics, social media embeds, and probably some other stuff too. An analysis by Marmelab found that up to 70% of the carbon footprint of media websites could be attributed to ads and stats (source).
Often we as developers aren’t in a position to remove these things entirely, and the conversation around web monetisation is a complex one. But we should at least load them as responsibly as possible. (I wrote about some strategies for optimising social media embeds for Smashing Magazine.)
One thing we might not consider, however, is whether the third parties themselves use green web hosting — that is, hosting that is powered by renewable energy. Fershad Irani has developed a useful tool that analyses the third-party scripts on your website: Are My Third Parties Green? checks whether they use a green web host (to the best of knowledge, via The Green Web Foundation’s dataset), as well as how much of your site’s overall size comes from third-party scripts, how effectively they’re cached, and their estimated carbon emissions.
Tools like this are great for shining a light on the environmental impact of our websites. Although measuring the carbon emissions of a website is far from an exact science, projects like this help raise awareness, and enable us to begin conversations and increasingly make informed choices.

The count down to version 100 of Chrome and Firefox is just
weeks away.
CSS cascade layers gives you more control over your CSS, and
helps to prevent style-specificity conflicts.
The showPicker() method allows you to programmatically
show a browser picker for <input> elements like date, color, and
datalist.
And there's plenty more.
I'm Pete LePage. Let's dive in and
see what's new for developers in Chrome 99.
# Chrome 100 and Firefox 100
Chrome 100 ships in late March (2022), and Firefox 100 ships shortly after in
early May. Both of these are a major version number milestone and roll over
to three digits. But, if your code is expecting two digits, the new version
number could cause issues for you.

Deep breathing has been shown to increase oxygen levels in the blood, improve cardiovascular health, and even boost mood. The problem is that most people are not aware of breathing correctly during exercise.


You should inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. This helps prevent air from entering your lungs and causing them to collapse. You also open your chest and expand your ribcage when you breathe deeply. It is a great way to stretch the muscles of your upper back.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Russian invasion of Ukraine is at once reaffirming all the ills of social media and showing its utterly unique capacity to give a direct voice to anyone around the world. And while the more unfortunate expressions of this being due to "blue eyes and blond hair", it is fostering a strong sense of fraternity here in Europe. This just is different than a far-away war in Yemen or even Syria. Being upset about the basic human graduation of empathy – that makes us care more about that which is closer and familiar – is an intellectualization straight out of Haidt's WEIRD diagnosis.
Being able to read, in real time, about members of the Ukrainian parliament taking up arms, mixed together with pictures of walking the dog, is a deeply humanizing experience. Seeing Zelenskyy tweeting his calls wi…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://daverupert.com/2022/02/the-accordion/"/>
        <updated>2022-02-27T19:57:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“The Accordion” (Τ’ ακορντεόν) is an old, popular Greek song written by Manos Loïzos (Μάνος Λοΐζος) in 1967 while Greece was under far-right military junta control. It’s an unassuming anti-fascist song with it’s slow, folksy tone and fluttering accompaniment, but it’s final words offer a somber battle cry: “Fascism will not prevail!”
Manos spent his latter years in the Soviet Union where he died in Moscow in 1982. I’m not sure if he ever escaped fascism (despotism?), but perhaps the communism of the Soviet Union suited him better than the military junta in Greece.
I first heard this song on a news story about Orestes Fintiklis. Fintiklis was removing Trump’s name from his international hotel in Panama when a scuffle happened between security staff and the new management. Once the fight broken up, employees terminated, and Trump’s name removed from the hotel, Fintiklis sat down at the piano and played this song.


Στη γειτονιά μου την παλιά είχα ένα φίλο
που ήξερε και έπαιζε τ' ακορντεόν
όταν τραγούδαγε φτυστός ήταν ο ήλιος
φωτιές στα χέρια του άναβε τ' ακορντεόν

Μα ένα βράδυ σκοτεινό σαν όλα τ' άλλα
κράταγε τσίλιες παίζοντας ακορντεόν
φασιστικά καμιόνια στάθηκαν στη μάντρα
και μια ριπή σταμάτησε τ' ακορντεόν

Τ' αρχινισμένο σύνθημα πάντα μου μένει
όποτε ακούω από τότε ακορντεόν
κι έχει σαν στάμπα τη ζωή μου σημαδέψει
δε θα περάσει ο φασισμός


In my old neighborhood I had a friend
who knew and played the accordion
when he sang, he was like the sun
fires in his hands ignited by the accordion

But at one dark night, like every other night
he kept a look-out playing the accordion
fascist trucks stood in the paddock
and a gun shot stopped the accordion

The started slogan comes back to me
whenever I hear an accordion
and it has marked my life like a stamp
'Fascism will not prevail!']]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just released v0.3.2 of Hibiki HTML (lots of new changes and features)!
The biggest, from the feedback I got on HN, is that Hibiki HTML is now
licensed under the standard MPL v2 (Mozilla Public License v2, OSI
approved), and is able to be integrated into any project (free,
commercial, or (A)GPL) without any fear over a non-standard license.
I've also released a new Bulma UI control library for Hibiki -
https://libs.hibikihtml.com/test-bulma.html .  It features buttons,
tabs, menus, modals, great looking form inputs and controls, and a
simple data-table control with built in sorting and pagination!  There
are also Hibiki HTML library wrappers for rendering markdown and code
highlighting.
Hibiki HTML is a great middle ground between vanilla HTML and full-on
JS frameworks like React or Vue.  You can add dynamic functionality,
reuseable components, and backend REST calls in a single HTML file.
No tools to install, no JavaScript stack to configure,
no build process, and no need to be a JavaScript expert.
It works works great for embedding into backend
servers (or scripts), tools to interact with REST APIs, or
adding dynamic functionality to static sites.
I'd love to to hear and answer any feedback, questions, or comments.
If you have a project you'd like to use Hibiki HTML on, I'm also happy
to lend a hand or build out additional functionality or components you
might need.

We've had some explosive, illuminating, and contested conversations over the years, Jason and I. And I've loved everyone of them. Whether we were discussing venture capital, profitable businesses, and the definition of success or talking about big tech, education, healthcare, and wealth taxes. Having intense debates about big questions is a thrill. But this last one was different.
Partly because we simply agreed more than we usually do, but also because the topics felt dangerous this time around. Like I ought to weigh my words carefully, lest I open a flank for later attacks. Like every argument ought to be hidden in an armored helmet from inside a protective trench.

Songs from their faith, country, region, race, culture, subculture, futbol team, or even the local tavern; a shared connection. The following is one of the songs from my community, a lament, I’d like to share with you all.
Been In This War For Too Long: Liturgical Demonstrations From Bygone Days by Seth Woods

G             D           C  
Remember your mercies, O Lord  
G                 D  
We’ve got so much hurt  
Remember we’ve fallen so hard  
From our concrete towers to Earth  
Remember we sleep every night  
With doors locked and shades pulled down tight  
Remember your mercies, O Lord  

G             C       G  
We’re already so terrified  
Em                  C  
We just stay in one place  
We just cover our faces  
We just look at our hands  
Em                      C       D  
We just don’t know what time it is  

Remember your mercies, O Lord  
Just could you please be kind  
We’re grateful for so many things  
But you also gave us these minds  
Like you gave us the sky and the trees  
And we couldn’t keep them from harm  
Remember your mercies, O Lord  
We’ve wired our hearts with alarm  

We just sit in these chairs now  
We just stare at these screens now  
We just work all the time now  
We just don’t know what day it is  

We’re tired and hungry for dreams now  
We’ve traded our love for relief  
When our casualties rise like black rivers  
From deserts to flood city streets  
Remember your mercies, O Lord  
Please don’t deny us our song  
We’re rambling, restless, and weary  
We’ve been in this war for too long  
We’re black and we’re blue and we’re broke down  
We’ve been in this war for too long

But I can see how he's been able to slide past the professionally outraged class of media watchers so far. I mean, look at him! He's the anti-Rogan persona from afar.

Sites that haven't had time to migrate away from using the reduced User-Agent string and move toward User-Agent Client Hints can take part in a deprecation trial to continue receiving the full User-Agent string.
The registration for the deprecation trial will begin with the Chrome 100 Beta. It will allow sites to receive the full User-Agent string ahead of the Chrome 101 release, where the minor version string will be reduced. If you would like to test the origin trial on Chrome 100 Beta before it launches to the stable channel, be sure to register and test before the release date for Chrome 100 (currently scheduled for March 31st, 2022).

Putting together the line-up of a three-day event is quite challenging, but kind of fun too. On the one hand, each day should be able to stand alone. After all, there are one-day tickets available. On the other hand, it should feel like one cohesive conference, not three separate events.
I’ve decided to structure the three days to somewhat mimic the design process…
The first day is all about planning and preparation. This is like the first diamond in the double-diamond process: building the right thing. That means plenty of emphasis on research.
The second day is about creation and execution. It’s like that …]]></summary>

Objections to this term has taken many forms. But they all seek to justify the opposite label of "violent", no matter the blind logical leaps required.
Some claim that the background of certain organizers or participants as either anti-government, white supremacist, trumpers, conferate-flag-wavers, or whatever means that even if there were no (or only isolated) violent acts, that this still rendered the protests at large violent. Others that "hateful rhetoric" or "unacceptable views" was violence in speech. Others still that incessant honking or blocked streets constituted violence against the peace and habitability of their city.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone who's been hiring people for 23 years, I've seen, read, and reviewed tens of thousands of job applications.
The ones that typically rise to the top are the ones that demonstrate effort to get this job, and not just any job.
We recently hired our first Email Marketing Manager. Nearly 400 people applied for the position.
As applications tend to do, they ranged from the basic resume, to the standard cover letter and resume, to the custom cover letter and resume, and, finally, some more creative approaches to stand out.
I wanted to share one, in particular. This application is shared with the applicant's permission, although it's been slightly modified to remove personal information they weren't comfortable sharing publicly.
Beyond it being an exceptionally good application — you'll know why when you see it — it was the one that got the person the job. This is who we hired. It's a great example of what really wanting the job can look like when you put in the extra effort to stand out in the right ways.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many of us have so many duties in life that we neglect to look after our own needs. This is especially true for those who are responsible for a large number of people. Self-care is a vital element of stress management, even if it's difficult to prioritize when you have so many other things on your to-do list.


How Self-Care Can Help You


When we're physically and emotionally exhausted, we're less equipped to handle the challenges that life throws at us. Or, to put it another way, when we are physically and emotionally at our best, we are more robust and capable of handling life's stress. A massage, a hot bath, or some other type of pampering rejuvenates you on the inside and out. Taking time to maintain self-care provides a number of advantages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I never did make it all the way through Jean Baudrillard's book Simulacra and Simulation before I lost my paperback copy on a trip. But it lodged several perspectives deep in my brain that I'm still trying to process. One of which was this:

Disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us believe that the rest is real.

It's a novel illustration of the point both David Graeber and Yuval Noah Harari have kept making in their works: Human institutions are all, broadly speaking, make believe. 
Where Harari illustrates this point with everything from the corporation to human rights, Graeber invites us to imagine fresh alternatives to debt and capitalism. And I remember nodding to both, but it was Baudrillard's pithy contrast that really made the point sink in.
Yet even when it's sunk …]]></summary>

The original URL for this prediction (www.longbets.org/601) will no longer be available in eleven years.
One year later, Matt called me on it and the prediction officially became a bet:
We’re playing for $1000. If I win, that money goes to the Bletchley Park Trust. If Matt wins, it goes to The Internet Archive.
I’m very happy to lose this bet.
When I made the original prediction eleven years ago that a URL on the longbets.org site would no longer be available, I did so in a spirit of mischief—it was a deliberately meta move. But it was also informed by a genuine feeling of pessimism around the longevity of links on the web. While that pessimism was misplaced in this case, it was informed by data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[eBPF is an amazing technology that allows safely running user-supplied functions at pretty much arbitrary probe points in a kernel/user space context. Much has been written about how amazing this feature is for kernel observability. But as someone who writes user space code, what I find even more amazing is the support for tracing arbitrary user space programs, with no code changes and low overhead.
However, doing in-depth analysis can get complicated and time-consuming. My goal with wachy was to make this debugging significantly easier/faster to use, by displaying traces in a TUI next to the source code and allowing for interactive drilldown analysis. If you get a chance, check out the start of the demo video since (AFAIK) it's quite unique and gives a much clearer idea than I can provide with just text.

In the post he shares his opinions on blogging as a way to order your thoughts and ideas, somewhere between a sketchbook full of notes and a fully-formed essay. He writes:
The very act of recording your actions and impressions is itself powerfully mnemonic, fixing the moment more durably in your memory so that it’s easier to recall in future, even if you never consult your notes.
That’s certainly the way it works for me. I find the best way to learn about a technical concept is by writing about it. Often I’ll refer back to a blog post I’ve written in the past, to refresh my memory. Sometimes the act of writing itself is enough to preserve it in my mind.

This year marks fifteen years of freelancing in my life. That’s 100% of my work life and nearly half the time I live on this world. So I wrote something down on it on my blog.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this month I has the pleasure of speaking at a special green-themed edition of Toronto Web Performance Meetup (online). There were three of us speaking in all, each with a different take on how we as web developers can reduce our environmental impact.
Web Performance And The Planet
Fershad Irani spoke about how web performance relates to our site’s carbon emissions, and the concrete actions we can take to build our sites greener. His article analysing the COP26 website helped inspire my own article for CSS Tricks on website carbon budgets.

Building a Greener Web
My own talk was about the wider context around reducing our website’s environmental impact, how we can convince stakeholders to make it a priority, and why individual action matters. I also talked about some of the things we can do beyond making our websites greener, as part of the wider community.

The Carbon Footprint of Images
Jon A. Særetås talked about images on the web, and how we can reduce their environmental impact. His talk included some really interesting data, and some surprising details we don’t often consider — like the fact that many of our file live on in the cloud indefinitely, meaning they continue to consume resources.

You might notice that this post avoids including YouTube embeds. I recently wrote about the environmental and performance impact of third-party embeds for Smashing Magazine. Linking to the videos instead of embedding them vastly reduced the page weight — and saves you, the user, from downloading unnecessary resources if you choose not to watch the videos!]]></summary>

They unnecessarily add them to the keyboard focus order of the web page. They ensure the clear buttons are accessible - but not keyboard focusable. The clear button(s) do not show up when their associated fields are readonly or disabled, The button’s respect reading directionality of a web page (e.g., dir=rtl), and that keyboard focus returns to the text field once the clear button has been activated.]]></summary>

So-called UX is a scourge.
My experience in industry has been (unsurprisingly) that companies care only for usability insofar as marketability (or lawsuits) are concerned (so looms the shadow of the American Federation for the Blind).
I spent the better part of a year working out how to make a Swing desktop app usable for the blind (not to mention a full prior year of HCI graduate-level training and consultation with a blind PhD. candidate for the same) into something tolerable by prevailing standards, for which I insisted on actual trials by blind users.
Today, I feel like we need an American Federation for the Sighted (or otherwise perceiving) to

There is a limitation with the Screenshot Service: when the page you’re taking a screenshot of is slow and/or very large, the request times out. Quoth myself, from ~7 months ago:
What happens if a site is super slow or is currently down?
Netlify Functions have a 10 second execution limit. If the site doesn’t render in 10 seconds, we show a fallback image by default. Currently this is a low-contrast 11ty logo using the same image size as the requested screenshot (via SVG width and height attributes).
While this fallback behavior is okay I was starting to see it more often than I’d like. Why, you might ask? Why would it take more than 10 seconds to fetch a screenshot?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, author here.
This project was a pleasure to do, Remix has very good developer experience. But further than that it's actually a really good way to develop applications, it's a mix of old meets new where the paradigm encourages you to take advantage of web standards for data fetching (forms, links, a tags).
And it turns out that it's actually an optimal way to develop simple or even complex web applications which can deploy in a number of runtime environments (including edge workers). So you can get an insanely fast website for users. Note that this project is not necessarily an optimal website implementation (since it copies Hacker News) but rather it's intended to be useful as a starting point or reference for your own projects!
You can read about some of the benefits of it on the project page linked.
By the way I'm currently available to work (if you email me at clinton.dannolfo @gmail!)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What's the goodwill of developers worth to a platform operator? It's a hard question, because it can't be answered by the traditional economic models used by bean counters to populate the balance sheet. And it's far more ephemeral than the goodwill of consumers. The relationship is more intertwined. We're not just engaging in transactions, we're lifting each other up. Good developers breed strong platforms, and strong platforms attract good developers. When it works, it's symbiotic.
There's nothing symbiotic about Apple's current relationship with its developers. 
Every time Apple mobilizes its law machine to squash a developer in court, foil democratic accountability in the legislatures, or give regulators the middle finger, Apple wounds the relationship with developers. They can win ever…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I suck at CSS. There, I said it.
I've always loved frameworks like Bootstrap, Bulma, etc... that let's me build frontends the same way I would play Legos as a kid.
I understand CSS, what the properties do, individually. But I lack the creativity and design skills required to come up with half of what is provided by those frameworks. I could do it if I had infinite time and patience, but I don't.
I've heard a lot of good about TailwindCSS for a couple of years now. So I gave it a try. From what I've gather after a few days, I don't understand it.
Instead of writing CSS, I add classes to my HTML. Ok, but I don't want to rewrite everything all the time, it would be like using the inline style attribute.
Ok, then I install PostCSS, and start writing classes with @apply. Wait, hang on, isn't that just writing plain old CSS with a new syntax and new names to learn?
I must be missing something, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Way back when, we used to release new software on Fridays all the time. That often meant working Saturdays and Sundays to fix an urgent problem with the new stuff, wrecking the weekend for whoever did the release.
It was stupid yet predictable, because we kept setting deadlines at the end of the week, as most naturally do. But Friday is the worse day to release anything.
First off, you probably rushed to finish before the weekend. So work done on Fridays tends to be a bit sloppy.
Second, Mondays don't come after Fridays. Saturdays and Sundays do. So if something goes wrong, someone's working the weekend.
Third, if you work the weekends, you don't get a chance to recharge. Basically, when you've worked all week, and you're forced to work the weekend, the following Monday is the eighth day o…]]></summary>

She did all the drawings. I digitized them and added them to the page as inline SVGs. Then I wrote the code. Nothing fancy — it's just one HTML page with a few links. But I like the end result (yes, I'm 100% biased): https://kevin.tw
Fun technical facts: the page is entirely self-contained (except the favicon). It doesn't have any JavaScript at all. And it weighs 35Kb total (52Kb if you include the favicon).

The right wireframe can make an excellent app – turning an idea perfectly into an app, while a wrong wireframe can break everything.

You know, the ancient practice of listening, presenting arguments, accepting counterarguments, and progressing towards a deeper shared understanding. Even when the topics are hot. Even when the counterpart is a stranger. And it's giving me vintage internet vibes!
Take this Canadian trucker protest, for example. I've heard from a lot of Canadians on the topic. Some support the protests, others don't. It's clearly a topic where a Canadian might feel like a Dane shouldn't have standing to participate in the discussion (and plenty do!). Yet literally all the many debates I've had over the past week since writing about this topic have managed to be civil and respectful despite also occasionally being tense. Remarkable.

Transcript: #
If you're seeing this video, it is Monday, February 14—Yep.
Which means that I am now very excited to announce that effective today, Netlify will be sponsoring full-time development of Eleventy!
Eleventy started with the very basic idea that the tools we use to make websites should be simpler for both beginners and experts, and we are still working very hard to continue to deliver on that mission today.
This announcement is such huge news for our project in multiple ways: the project's longevity, sustainability, delivery of features, integrations fixes enabling folks to take on even larger scale projects (if this sounds like your project, please get in touch).
This is one small part of Netlify's larger strategy to invest in an ecosystem of frameworks and tools to make building for the web easier, more resilient, and more scalable. I'm now on a team of three folks working toward those goals, and if this sounds like a pretty sweet deal to you, we are hiring.
And personally speaking, I'm just so grateful to have this opportunity. Grateful to the folks that have trusted Eleventy with their web projects, grateful to folks that have participated in our community, whether it be answering questions, writing blog posts, code, docs, or being friendly on Discord, Twitter, or at meetups.
I'm grateful to everyone building for the open web—accessible to all—independent of walled gardens and app stores, where a wallet isn't a prerequisite.
And I don't know if you all can tell, but I am so excited. If Eleventy was walking before now we're going to find out what it really feels like to run.
Stay tuned.]]></summary>

This spun out of a video editor which I originally built in Swift. It turns out people on Windows want to edit videos too, so now I’m rewriting it with Rust, Electron, and Svelte with an eye for performance.
Rust is a systems programming language, akin to C or C++, but safer. It’s known for being super fast.
Electron is a framework for building cross-platform desktop apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s known for being kinda slow and bloaty. But there’s an ace up its sleeve: Electron apps can be extended with compiled native code, and if you do the heavy stuff in native code you can a nice speed boost.
Svelte is a JavaScript UI framework – an alternative to React, Vue, Angular, or one of the other 750…]]></summary>

I use Firefox as my main browser, which claims to protect privacy by blocking trackers. And to be honest, I don’t read a lot of articles on desktop, preferring to read the news on mobile while I’m on the go. While you might get one or two pop-ups on mobile, the area available for them is clearly a lot smaller, and I generally find the browsing experience for many of the sites I regularly visit is OK.
Most of the sites I do visit on desktop are for my day-to-day job, or research for this blog, and are built with developers as the target audience.

EVERY Gundam Timeline Explained - Tim Lyu breaks down every Gundam timeline and series in an incredible and obsessive fashion. I also watched his Evangelion breakdown too. youtube.com
Scams, Art Theft and NFTs - I like Brad Colbow’s thinking, from an artist’s perspective, around NFTs. youtube.com
Make Free Stuff - Max Böck touches on one of my biggest concerns with Web3 in that it attempts “to impose even more artificial locks and transactions on users, to extract even more money”, getting away from the Web’s anti-capitalist beginnings. mxb.dev
Omnichord - Jake Albaugh makes a free musical instrument using the Web Audio API. And it’s fun. Also, subdomains rule. omnichord.jake.fun
nuxt-cms-template - Alex Riviere and Andrew Walpole figured out how to integrate Netlify CMS’s block-based editor and preview feature with a Nuxt application. It may not sound like a big deal but getting a React app and a Nuxt app working together without creating a turducken is pretty intuitive. github.com
Accessible document workflow iwth Eleventy and Prince - Larry Hudson shows how to turn an Eleventy site into an accessible PDF using Prince. 11ty-prince-pdf-example.netlify.app]]></summary>

The long expansion of enabling concepts is now at last being compressed for human comprehension. Hallelujah!
And like with expanding complexity, where one complication often leads to another, compressing complexity also cascades.
Propshaft, a new asset pipeline library for Rails, is the result of such a cascading compression of complexity. Enabled by the same trifecta of HTTP/2, browser-run ES6, and import maps that powers Rails 7, Propshaft is dramatically simpler than the Sprockets …]]></summary>

And yet, Danish society has simply moved on.
At our kids' school, it seems that virtually everyone has had omicron by now. With anecdotes ranging from no symptoms at all to the majority experiencing mild colds to a few with flu-like symptoms.

So that's why I'm back to in-person lessons. I tried YouTube, I tried some books, I tried an app or two, I tried a bunch of stuff, but I've discovered I simply learn guitar best with one-on-one in-person instruction.

With a persistence that is driving some progressives both inside and outside of Canada absolutely batty. How dare these truckers continue to exercise their basic political rights to freedom of assembly, association, and speech?!

While honking horns and blocking roads is surely thinning the patience of nearby residents, it's hardly the kind of actions that would warrant sending in the military. Which is rather inconvenient if you'd really like the military to use its force against your domestic, political opponents!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spring is the season for new beginnings, a time to renew and recharge.  But more importantly just as we do a regular ‘spring clean’ of our home to declutter our personal space we should also be focused on a ‘spring cleanup for our mind’ as well.   


After all, it is your mental thoughts that create your life’s destiny


Declutter your mind, what a fabulous idea!  Begin to rid yourself of any negative thoughts and behaviours you have harbored from the past in order to live a fulfilling life now.   Let’s use a seed we plant in the earth as an analogy.  With enough nurturing and care that seed will bloom into a beautiful plant or flower.   However, at the same time if you are not taking care of it weeds will begin to grow and the plant will die off and wither away from a lack of attention.

In particular, we have greatly appreciated all who have offered considerate feedback, as some of that feedback has already made its way into improving the product!
While in many ways, this release is just another refinement in our ongoing product iteration, it also involved some relatively big changes. In fact, enough has changed around here that perhaps it's helpful to first acknowledge what has not: our content, features, and functionality.
Still, things do look a bit different! So in this post, I'll aim to detail many of the goals and design decisions behind what's changed, and even share a little about where we're headed…]]></summary>

I have logged hundreds of hours complaining about browsers on Twitter, on podcasts, and on this blog. I have logged thousands more hours trying to keep up with browsers and I frequently interact with people who write specs and make browsers. I have not been 100% successful in my efforts to get a <rupert> element as my legacy but I have learned a lot about giving feedback to web browsers.
Browsers are really complex
Eric Meyer recently put it very well…
[W]eb browsers are actually 60fps+ rendering environments.  They’re First-Person Scrollers.

 Don’t repeat yourself too much, but also don’t abstract your code to an extent that it is not understandable.
 In programing, DRY is an acronym that stands for Don’t Repeat Yourself. It’s good advice that’s sometimes treated as a Holy Grail in coding.
Sometimes, a little repeated code a good thing. Today, I wanted to look at some specific examples of when DRY is good, and when it creates more problems than it solves.]]></summary>

The worst part is, I often just blank in the 5 minute question time. I’ll come up with something because I’m good on my feet, but deep down it feels ineffectual. I’m not getting what I need in that time period, so let me just use the bathroom before the next interview.

I mentioned that I had a go-to list of questions that I literally printed and brought with me, and would bring out during this 5-minute lightning round. I definitely felt like a huge nerd pulling a set of printed questions out of a binder.
But it turned out to be really helpful, and at a couple of these interviews, my interviewer …]]></summary>

I want to sell a few items (handmade) but I don't want my store to look like any other e-commerce store. Ideally, I'd want it to look like a game  where my customer avatars can walk around and pick up items like they do in a physical store.
Any tips and tricks on where to start looking? Or am I off my rocker?

That’s certainly not a complaint from me: it makes sense to consider properties as part of an ecosystem. But I have to confess, I love it when a new CSS property lands in browsers that doesn’t have a steep learning curve and just works, with no fuss. The aspect-ratio property hits all the right spots there, neatly solving with a single line of CSS something that was, quite frankly, a bit of faff before. It’s been supported in browsers for going on a year now, but with Safari finally catching up in September 2021, we can finally …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a well established phone checking habit.
If I'm developing and my tests are running I pick up my phone. If my phone is in my peripheral vision I will pick it up at some point to check what's happening on it. If I'm working on a problem and I'm not sure exactly what to do I pick up my phone (to sooth my nerves).
I don't like the habit, but I have it.
I used to pick up my phone to check online dating sites a lot, but now I am less interested in them. So I find myself picking up my phone and not really being sure what to do with it when it is in my hands.
There are two directions I can go in (I think):
1. Stop picking up my phone as much. This means my brain needs to get better at holding that boring period where there are no inputs. (I must be a dopamine addict)
2. Find something more interesting to look at when I pick up my phone (by the morning I will already have checked Reddit and the news, so need something new).
Does anyone have any ideas of interesting apps to look at that could turn this habit into something productive?
Does anyone have any success getting more comfortable "holding" the boredom? (Maybe I should buy a Rubik's cube?!)

Their first attempt would literally have re-routed donations for the truckers to “other charities”. That sounded so crazy when I first read it that I had to dig up multiple confirming sources to believe it to be true. But true enough it was!


Thankfully, this original plan was revised after Gofundme got some “donor feedback”, including from the likes of Elon Musk (what a timeline we’re living in!). The new plan will “just” block the donations from reaching their intended recipients, and result in refunds 7-10 days(!!) from now. What a conveniently long time to keep $10 million locked up, and unable to support the protesting t…]]></summary>

Yes, I know that the week finishes on Friday, but Fridays have been declared the no-meetings day at Clearleft: a chance to concentrate on heads-down work without interruption. Besides, some of us don’t work on Fridays. So Thursday really is the new Friday.
At this Thursday afternoon meeting we give and get updates on what’s been happening with project work, new business, events, marketing. We also highlighted any shout-outs that have posted in the #beingsplendid Slack channel during the week. Once that’s all taken care of, the Thursday afternoon meeting often finishes with a fun activity.

Opening up the Gameboy up and took a peek, and yep, found game pak loading doberry had been messed with. Bit of a duff job on whoever tried to repair it before me - and it even looks like they spotted there was a short and tried to slice through it with a knife:

Pins A2 and A1 were definitely connected! Some flux and solder later and it looks more like this:
