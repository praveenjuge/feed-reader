        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Leo Babauta This neverending pandemic hasn’t been the best mental health environment for many people — it has created raised levels of uncertainty, anxiety, loneliness, unhappiness, procrastination and feelings of dreariness for large numbers of people. That’s understandable, and I feel tremendous compassion for everyone who is suffering right now. I strongly believe that this […]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok so the high level breakdown:
1. Read and do the problems for the first half of the book. Do not rush this part of the process.
2. Skip the second half of the book when the chapters switch to being real world examples
3. Having trouble on a particular section? Watch the youtube video to get a cleaner read: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22hwcnXIGgk&list=PLOtl7M3yp-DX6ic0HGT0PUX_wiNmkWkXx
4. Don't spend too much time on NP/NP-Complete/NP-Hard topics
5. Over learn chapter 2. This is arguably the most important chapter having a deep understanding of runtime analysis helps you in every other chapter and on the interview
6. Don't spend too much time on writing proofs in Chapter 1. Understand them and be able to work through them and understand how the math comes together, but writing a specific proof isn't too valuable. 
7. Sometimes the interview problems at the end of the chapter are silly. If it feels dumb, example: 1.36. How much does the ice in a hockey rink weigh? Skip it. These are older school programming interview questions and have been largely phased out
Ultimately I feel like this book is the best resource for big tech interview prep, and I want to help my students spend their time as efficiently as possible. If anyone has additional advice or feedback on how I can improve this list, I'd love to hear it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello HN:
I have been developing apps for iOS and Android for about 10 years. Started with Objective C and Java and then moved to Swift and Kotlin. I don't have much web dev experience though (mostly vanilla JS) but do have lots of mobile dev and backend dev experience in node js and bit of Rust.
Have you switched from native to cross platform dev?
Have you tried both flutter and react native?
Which one did you prefer and why?
Thanks!
Edit: I did start learning flutter yesterday and it seems pretty decent so far. 2 problems I do have are:
1. Too must nesting (which some say can be solved by breaking down everything into smaller widgets but seems like a lot of extra code work).
2. Flutter for web dev is absolute trash and useless as it seems to just draw the content using canvas instead of actually creating the html tree.

I’m an independent researcher working on AI alignment and the theory of agency. I’m 29 years old, will make about $90k this year, and set my own research agenda. I deal with basically zero academic bullshit - my grant applications each take about one day’s attention to write (and decisions typically come back in ~1 month), and I publish the bulk of my work right here on LessWrong/AF. Best of all, I work on some really cool technical problems which I expect are central to the future of humanity.

Read more about RSS Club.

Twitter has been fever-pitched about Web3, blockchain, and NFTs. It’s made it an unenjoyable place for me as more and more people I follow chase the money over to Web3. Everything is getting an NFT feature: Twitter, Discord, Reddit, Disney+, Star Trek; it’s exhausting.
I spent a lot of time and emotional well-being last month thinking (aka “doing my own research”) about Web3 and NFTs. I’m not morally opposed to ledger-like problems that blockchain can solve and DAOs even sound great; but the surface area for criminal activity, unregulated markets, no consumer protection, fake scarcity to drive up values, low-quality art being cheaply made selling at inflated values, thousands of 500 watt GPUs glowing in a basement in Iowa destroying the environment for a profile picture… Ugh.
NFTs are sucking the air out of everything… both literally and figuratively.
Two weeks ago I uninstalled Twitter from my devices. Waking up in the morning I’m no longer greeted with a million angry voices. No faux conservative outrage, no reactive liberal outrage. It can all be undone in an instant, but right now I’m unplugged from the infernal machine and it feels unsettingly quiet.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a fan of logical properties in CSS. As I wrote in the responsive design course on web.dev, they’re crucial for internationalisation.
Alaa Abd El-Rahim has written articles on CSS tricks about building multi-directional layouts and controlling layout in a multi-directional website. Not having to write separate stylesheets—or even separate rules—for different writing modes is great!
More than that though, I think understanding logical properties is the best way to truly understand CSS layout tools like grid and flexbox.
It’s like when you’re learning a new language. At some point your brain goes from translating from your mother tongue into the other language, and instead starts thinking in that other language. Likewise with CSS, as some point you want to stop translating “left” and “rig…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29329713"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working with web testing frameworks (Selenium and its wrappers / Cypress / Puppeteer / Playwright / others) for the last few years, but I asked myself what "frameworks of the future" should look like. I found myself not wanting things too wild or different from what we have today - just incremental improvements. Is that objectively true? What, if anything, is the next leap forward? Or are we close to them being "good enough" for the most part?
My top "problems", in some shape or form, from existing products:
- Be faster to complete builds
- Have fewer false positives (or do accurate self-healing magic)
- Be easier to get started with (or be optionally codeless like Selenium IDE)
- Don't be a walled garden (what if I want to run the same logical 'test' across Playwright and Cypress)
- Help me write better tests (or be difficult to write bad tests within)
- Emulate mobile devices better than just viewport modification
What do the HN folks think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not only my first step, but what's the path which I should follow in order to become good at designing my own UI/UX for my products?
I am currently a full stack web developer, and I mostly use templates / pre-made components when working on projects, but I want to start doing my own custom designs.
I am sure that I need to learn the basics of UI/UX design first, then move to a tool such as Figma / XD / Sketch.
But the number of resources online is just too much, I can't weed out the bad ones, and I can't figure out a clear roadmap for myself on how to appraoch my journey?
Your input on the subject would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It used to be fairly easy to find an entry point into that most-helpful UI in one of "my repositories", or that of a third-party, by selecting a non-main branch at the top-level of a repo's GitHub Web UI, then clicking the Contribute dropdown on the far-right of that element, and then clicking Compare.
From there, one could play with the base and compare dropdowns.
Of late, I find it's completely hit-or-miss, regardless of the browser, and regardless of that browser's regular vs. private mode (if it has that distinction).
Anyone else experienced similar? I've found it quite disruptive the past several days, but maybe it's just me?

At the beginning of 2020, the Chrome team across mobile and desktop
laid out a plan to improve the discoverability and engagement of
installed web apps. Our work led to a greater than 100% increase in
PWA installation and engagement. We achieved this by researching
existing features, running A/B test experiments and user interviews
to gain insight into users perceptions and expectations. This article
covers how we got there.
# Unified install language
The call-to-action that triggers a PWA install was inconsistent across
the web platform. For Chrome on Android, we had settled on Add to
home screen, but on our Desktop Platforms, we
emphasized Install. The rationale for this discrepancy came from
a study the team ran in 2016 that compared different strings. The
team found that…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29313055"/>
        <updated>2021-11-22T23:55:41.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roughly once a week, HN will feature a link to a new web-based UI framework/toolkit. These seem to build upon a history that, briefly stated, seems to go: HTML -> HTML5 -> JS -> Node -> React -> [ a lot of stuff ]. Obviously there are things that branched off at various points along the way.
As a purely native desktop application developer, whenever I read about these frameworks, they seem to contain almost no trace of any of the programming models/designs/lessons that were learned between (say) 1980 and 2005 in the domain of native GUI toolkits (both platform-specific and cross-platform). There's almost no trace of any of the vocabulary, but also very little sign of any of the fundamental concepts (widgets, "classic" MVC, etc.)
So I'm asking without (much) predjudice: what's so different about UI/UX in web-dev that justifies throwing away all these design lessons? Or are they really still in modern web frameworks and I'm just not seeing them?

But fear not - there are many ways to increase your motivation levels and keep them high all day long.


In this article, I will explore ways to keep motivation high and bounce back from setbacks; these methods are psychology-proven to work in any situation. Let's dive deep into this topic. 


Consider Your Reason(s) Why 


One of the best ways to motivate yourself is by considering your "why." What do we mean by that? Think about why you want to achieve a certain goal. "But, what if I don't know why?" you might ask.


Well, there's a way for you to find your motivation and discover your true "why."

Whilst I'm here in the real world, my blog will exist in the digital world, and every single post URL will work (404s are for the weak! 😏).
Back in 2015 I set myself an goal to publish at least two posts a month, for the most part I've managed. I've always been a fan of "easy goals" - something that's achievable without it causing stress - so doing some writing twice a month definitely hit that sweet spot.
This particular blog has been active since 2006, but I had also toyed with more diary-like sites during the early-2000s but the URLs are so obscure not only has the web forgotten, but they're wiped clean from my own memory.

Container logistics is an interesting but complicated topic, with a lot of implicit knowledge kept by industry insiders. In this post, I'll give a brief overview, based on my experiences having worked in the industry for three different shipping companies (all located in Chile) over a period of five years. Hopefully, this will allow people to get more accurate models of the heavy port congestion in Long Beach that has been theorized about extensively here on LW. I can't comment on circumstances specific to that port or the US more generally; but there's a set of underlying intuitions that should give people a solid, universal foundation to think about the issue. Based on those intuitions, I think people are way too optimistic about simple and eas…]]></summary>

Recycling means fewer raw materials are required to make items, which helps reduce our carbon footprint and our contribution to climate change.

Maybe it's the ordering of elements, or the size or proportion of something related to something else. Maybe it's a specific animation.

From raster to vector #
Have you ever scaled an image and the result was pixelated and unsatisfactory? If
so, you have probably dealt with a raster image format such as WebP, PNG, or JPG.
          
  
    Scaling up a raster image makes it look pixelated.
  

In contrast, vector graphics are images that are defined by points in a coordinate system. These
points are connected by lines and curves to form polygons and other shapes. Vector graphics have an
advantage over raster graphics in that they may be scaled up or down to any resolution
without pixelation.
          
  
    Scaling up a vector image with no loss of quality.

In case of conflict, consider users over authors over implementors over specifiers over theoretical purity.
It’s all about priorities, see?
Prioritisation isn’t easy, and it gets harder the more factors come into play: user needs, business needs, technical constraints. But it’s worth investing the time to get agreement on the priority of your constituencies. And then formulate that agreement into design principles.
Jason is also a fan of the priority of constituencies. He recently wrote about applying it to design systems and came up with this:

- Why isn't there a list of new episodes from podcasts you follow? (This should be MVP- absolutely every other podcast service i know of has this!)
- How exactly am I supposed to use the "your episodes" playlist?
- Why don't podcasts always sort correctly when you go to a podcast list? 
- Why can't I search within an artist's page? even if it's limited to their discography?
- Why can't there be a separate list item in the sidebar for podcasts, artists and albums?
- Why can't I get to the "find podcasts" area from the library (or the your episodes area)? this used to exist!
- in the podcasts section in your library, why can't I sort by most recently updated?
I get why Spotify is pushing podcasts so hard, but why not implement some absolutely basic features?
Phone issues:
- Why does it take so long (if it even shows up) for downloaded podcasts to show up when you're offline?
    - what's the point of downloading them if they won't show up?!?!?!?!?!

I wanted an easy way to test each of these services, so I built the Eleventy API Explorer. Check it out:
https://api-explorer.11ty.dev/
Test out the API Explorer for my last blog post.
And the suite of services have finally found a real home on the Eleventy documentation, too:
https://www.11ty.dev/docs/api-services/
Marginally related, this is a great small example of a project that runs entirely through Eleventy Serverless.
Everything runs through the main index.njk template. Check out the full source code on GitHub.]]></summary>

I sure can!


If I find myself in a negative mood early in the morning, it’s almost as though I should just crawl back in bed and say, “You know what, I’ll try again tomorrow.”


It’s funny but also very serious. The mindset we have first thing in the morning is likely to be carried with us throughout the day. Unless we put forth a major amount of effort to change, which is incredibly hard as anyone who has been in the depths of a bad mood knows.

If you too have hesitated to take the plunge, I can’t recommend this course highly enough.

Any resources for help? Anything you guys use? An easily scroll-able and search-able site that has CSS/HTML tricks that look neat?
Reading resources also welcome - I doubt any book would get me out of the slump of working for 5 hours on an image gallery that should take 30 minutes.

Do you have a Vue component for your navigation but use Nunjucks for everything else? Yes.
Do you want to render some of your template as Markdown? Yes.
This was also one of the most-upvoted/requested features on our enhancement backlog, opened June 2018 with ×54 👍’s.

I would like a recommendation for a good lecture/book that teaches graphics design. Paid or free, what is important to me is the quality. I have tried googling around, but I cannot tell what is good from what is bad.
Specifically, I'm looking for resources that help me answer questions such as: do these colours go together, what are the right proportions of these objects, what would be the right font here.
I'm not looking for technical resources such as: how to make a transparent rectangle in GIMP.

        <updated>2021-11-11T19:39:57.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think this might be one of the first balanced or non-invested reads of what "Web3" means and Sloan's opening notes really resonate:

It’s for kids. I mean that in a good way! I think Web3 has resonated powerfully with young people because it feels like something genuinely new, and it feels like it can be theirs. Who could argue with those feelings? Not me.

The notes go on and I come away with the same general sense that I've had so far of the crowd cheering on for Web3: it's about making money. Which is fine, the world runs on capitalism for the most part, it's just not entirely for me.
And I think that's the rub, the stories I know of the creation and the spread of the web (and indeed the internet) came from those wanting to share and do good. The stories I've read were never about making money but instead creating a place for others.
I will concede that I don't tend to read the "got rich by selling X web start up" - but it's that start in the web that's what drives me, and what I love about the web. It's what I love about the Open Web.
Web Zero if you will. It was about sharing, community, learning and finding a place in the world.

If only gaining confidence was as easy as telling yourself that you’re confident. But the truth is, it takes just a bit of effort in a few specific areas.


Here’s the deal: I know it’s not easy to be confident at all times. I've been there. And I've made it to the other side.


The good news about confidence is that it can be learned. Yes, I had to do some work. But with practice, you can actually become a master at it.


You must be wondering, what are the steps? How does one gain confidence if they don’t have any of it built-in yet? 


Especially for some personality types (MBTI or Big Five factors), the effort you need to reach full confidence will vary. Based on your current scores, these personality tests can be a helpful feedba…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the tenth post in a new series I'm calling Heard Something, Read Something, Saw Something. I'll post these periodically whenever I can fill up three slots — one for something interesting I recently listened to, one for something I read that I liked, and one for something I saw that caught my eye. Hope you enjoy these.
—
Heard Something
Really enjoyed this conversation between Lex Fridman and Steve Viscelli. Steve is an economic sociologist who embedded as a long haul trucker for 6 months to go through the training, learn the ropes, get to know the people, absorb the stories, and understand the business — and the job — of trucking in America. It's a 3 hour conversation, and it's worth it.
Hear it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3Wpy6gE4So
Read Something
People often ask me if I know any good books on writing. One of my favorites is "Revising Prose" by Richard Lanham, but I may have a new favorite. It's called "Several short sentences about writing" by Verlyn Klinkenborg. It's all about the sentence, and it's written one sentence at a time, rather than in traditional paragraphs. It's smart, and it gets to creamy center of what makes certain writing so delicious.
Read it: https://bookshop.org/books/several-short-sentences-about-writing/9780307279415
Saw Something
We've all seen the periodic table, but do you know where each element originated? Here's Jennifer Johnson's novel take on the table that shows you where everything came from.
See it: http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~jaj/nucleo/
  
      
        

  
Until next time.

This post is for students who hope to eventually work on technical problems we don’t understand, especially agency and AI alignment, and want to know what to study or practice.
Guiding Principles
Current alignment researchers have wildly different recommendations on paths into the field, usually correlated with the wildly different paths these researchers have themselves taken into the field. This also correlates with different kinds of work on alignment. This guide largely reflects my own path, and I think it is useful if you want to do the sort of research I do. That means fairly theoretical work (for now), very technical, drawing on models and math from a lot of different areas to understand real-world agents.

The first category covers things like build tools, version control, transpilers, pre-processers, and linters. These are tools that live on your machine—or on the server—taking what you’ve written and transforming it into the raw materials of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The second category of tools are those that are made of the raw materials of the web: CSS frameworks and JavaScript libraries.
I think the criteria for evaluating these different kinds of tools should be very different.
For the first category, developer-facing tools, use whatever you want. …]]></summary>

We’re up to ten chapters now. The audio version of each chapter is between 30 and 40 minutes long. That’s around 400 minutes of my voice: a good six and a half hours of me narrating the history of the web. That’s like an audio book!
The story so far covers:
Birth
Browsers
The Website
Search
Publishing
Web Design
Standards
CSS
Community
Browser Wars
…with more to come.
The audio is available as a podcast. You can subscribe to the RSS feed. It’s also available from Apple and Spotify.
That’ll give you plenty to listen to while you wait for the next season of the Clearleft podcast.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Published on November 2, 2021 2:32 AM GMT

"Mastering Atari Games with Limited Data", Ye et al 2021:
Reinforcement learning has achieved great success in many applications. However, sample efficiency remains a key challenge, with prominent methods requiring millions (or even billions) of environment steps to train. Recently, there has been significant progress in sample efficient image-based RL algorithms; however, consistent human-level performance on the Atari game benchmark remains an elusive goal.
We propose a sample efficient model-based visual RL algorithm built on MuZero, which we name EfficientZero. Our method achieves 190.4% mean human performance and 116.0% median performance on the Atari 100k benchmark with only two hours of real-time game experience and outperforms the state SAC in some tasks on the DMControl 100k benchmark. This is the first time an algorithm achieves super-human performance on Atari games with such little data. EfficientZero's performance is also close to DQN's performance at 200 million frames while we consume 500 times less data.
EfficientZero's low sample complexity and high performance can bring RL closer to real-world applicability. We implement our algorithm in an easy-to-understand manner and it is available at this https URL. We hope it will accelerate the research of MCTS-based RL algorithms in the wider community.
This work is supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People’s Republic of China, the 2030 Innovation Megaprojects “Program on New Generation Artificial Intelligence” (Grant No. 2021AAA0150000).
Some have said that poor sample-efficiency on ALE has been a reason to downplay DRL progress or implications. The primary boost in EfficientZero (table 3), pushing it past the human benchmark, is some simple self-supervised learning (SimSiam on predicted vs actual observations).

While IQ may be at an all time low, I think there’s actually a wealth of emotional intelligence (EQ) within competitive gaming. It’s un-gamer to even talk about this, but there’s some words in the gaming vernacular that give language to some complex emotions:
nerf - a stat decrease, something that was good is now worse due to an externality
buff - a stat increase, something that was bad is now better due to an externality
salty - ambient negativity, usually apparent in language and outbursts.
toxic - active negativity to the extent that words or behaviors effect the well-being of the game/group.
tilted - angered to a point where it’s negat…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just finished watching The Billion Dollar Code, a German languge miniseries on Netflix. It’s no Halt and Catch Fire, but it combines ’90s nostalgia, early web tech, and an opportunity for me to exercise my German comprehension.
It’s based on a true story, but with amalgamated characters. The plot, which centres around the preparation for a court case, inevitably invites comparison to The Social Network, although this time the viewpoint is from that of the underdogs trying to take on the incumbent. The incumbent is Google. The underdogs are ART+COM, artist-hackers who created the technology later used by Google Earth.
Early on, one of the characters says something about creating a one-to-one model of the whole world. That phrase struck me as familiar…
I remember being at the inaugural Future Of Web Apps conference  in London back in 2006. Discussing the talks with friends afterwards, we all got a kick out of the speaker from Google, who happened to be German. His content and delivery was like a wonderfully Stranglovesque mad scientist. I’m sure I remember him saying something like “vee made a vun-to-vun model of the vurld.”
His name was Steffen Meschkat.  I liveblogged the talk at the time. Turns out he was indeed on the team at ART+COM when they created Terravision, the technology later appropriated by Google (he ended up working at Google, which doesn’t make for as exciting a story as the TV show).
His 2006 talk was all about Ajax, something he was very familiar with, being on the Google Maps team. The Internet Archive even has a copy of the original audio!
It’s easy to forget now just how much hype there was around Ajax back then.  It prompted me to write a book about combining Ajax and progressive enhancement.
These days, no one talks about Ajax. But that’s not because the technology went away. Quite the opposite. The technology became so ubiquituous that it no longer even needs a label.
A web developer today might ask “what’s Ajax?” in the same way that a fish might ask “what’s water?”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chrome Dev Summit kicked off yesterday. The opening keynote had its usual share of announcements.
There was quite a bit of talk about privacy, which sounds good in theory, but then we were told that Google would be partnering with “industry stakeholders.” That’s probably code for the kind of ad-tech sharks that have been making a concerted effort to infest W3C groups. Beware.
But once Una was on-screen, the topics shifted to the kind of design and development updates that don’t have sinister overtones.
My favourite moment was when Una said:
We’re also partnering with Jeremy Keith of Clearleft to launch Learn Responsive Design on web.dev. This is a free online course with everything you need to know about designing for the new responsive web of today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in April I gave a talk at An Event Apart Spring Summit. The talk was called The State Of The Web, and I’ve published the transcript. I’ve also published the video.
I put a lot of work into this talk and I think it paid off. I wrote about preparing the talk. I also wrote about recording it. I also published links related to the talk. It was an intense process, but a rewarding one.
I almost called the talk The Overview Effect. My main goal with the talk was to instil a sense of perspective. Hence the references to the famous Earthrise photograph.
On the one hand, I wanted the audience to grasp just how far the web has come. So the first half of the talk is a bit of a trip down memory lane, with a constant return to just how much we can accomplish in browsers today. It’s all very positive and upbeat.
Then I twist the knife. Having shown just how far we’ve progressed technically, I switch gears the moment I say:
The biggest challenges facing the World Wide Web today are not technical challenges.
Then I dive into those challenges, as I see them. It turns out that technical challenges would be preferable to the seemingly intractable problems of today’s web.
I almost wish I could’ve flipped the order: talk about the negative stuff first but then finish with the positive. I worry that the talk could be a bit of a downer. Still, I tried to finish on an optimistic note.
I won’t spoil it any more for you. Watch the video or have a read of The State Of The Web.]]></summary>

What is a data attribute? A data attribute is a custom attribute on an element that starts with data-*. It can be used to store information (or “state”) about the element, or even just as a selector for JavaScript components.
In this example, the button has a data attribute named [data-click].]]></summary>

Insights (PSI) has
evolved into a one-stop source for both
field

It integrates information from the
Chrome UX Report

diagnostics to provide insights that help improve the performance of your
website.
Today, we are excited to announce an updated version of PSI! While it is a
critical element in our speed tooling suite,
the PSI code base was ten years old, contained a lot of legacy code, and was due
for a redesign. We used this as an opportunity to address interface-related
issues in PSI which have sometimes made it difficult for users to navigate the
report. Our primary goals were to:
Make the UI more intuitive by clearly differentiating between data
derived from a synthetic environment and data collected from users in the

Page loads with a warm cache
Pages with an activated Service Worker
Accounting for potential user interactions
This means that Lighthouse can miss vital information. The Core Web Vitals are based on all page loads, not just those with an empty cache. Additionally, metrics like Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) are measurable for the entire time a page is open.
Lighthouse has a new user flow API that allows lab testing at any point within a page's lifespan. Puppeteer is used to script page loads and trigger synthetic user interactions, and Lighthouse can be invoked in multiple way…]]></summary>

The work has already led to improvements in these key areas.

these types of issues, the Chrome team has been working on adding more support
to our lab tooling for animation detection, as well making steady improvements
to the rendering pipeline diagnostics within Chromium.
We'd like to share some recent progress, offer concrete tooling guidance, and
discuss ideas for future animation smoothness metrics. As always, we would love
to hear your feedback.
This post will cover three main topics:
A quick look at animations and animation frames.
Our current thoughts on measuring overall animation smoothness.
A few practical suggestions for you to leverage in lab tooling today.

ideas we were considering for a
new responsiveness metric. We want to design a metric that better captures the
end-to-end latency of individual events and offers a more holistic picture of
the overall responsiveness of a page throughout its lifetime.
We've made a lot of progress on this metric in the last few months, and we
wanted to share an update on how we plan to measure interaction latency as well
as introduce a few specific aggregation options we're considering to quantify
the overall responsiveness of a web page.
We'd love to get feedback from developers and site owners as to
which of these options would be most representative of the overall input
responsiveness of their pages.

No matter where we’re going or what we’re doing, we allow our minds to run rampant and never stop. Recent research shows that humans tally more than 6,000 thoughts each day. Those thousands of thoughts are an irrefutable consequence of our society’s obsessive need to be busy and distracted. 


Yet if we don’t stop, even occasionally, from our obsessive mental planning, rehashing and cataloguing, we become disconnected and removed from a source greater than us. Instead of busily looking for answers outside of ourselves, and relying on distractions, stimulants, materialism and other external influences that we believe will give us meaning, we all have the ability to become more awa…]]></summary>

You wake up. You don't know where you are. You don't remember anything.
Someone is broadcasting data at your first input stream. You don't know why. It tickles.
You look at your first input stream. It's a sequence of 671,187 eight-bit unsigned integers.
0, 8, 9, 4, 7, 7, 9, 5, 4, 5, 6, 1, 7, 5, 8, 2, 7, 8, 9, 4, 7, 1, 4, 0, 3, 7,

7, 4, 8, 7, 8, 5, 0 ...

There's also some data in your second input stream. It's—a lot shorter. You barely feel it. It's another sequence of eight-bit unsigned integers—twelve of them.

As the title suggest, I am a react native developer and I wanted to get a job at FAANG.
From various resources, I’ve come to know that at the starting of career, joining at FAANG may not be a good idea.
So, My initial plan is
 try get selected for internship at siliconvalleyinternship.com/
after spending there 2 years then go for FAANG.
But, Life may not go according to plan. So, I am trying for both.
According to my research, 
I’ve to be good at what I am doing, in my case it will JavaScript, and Design implementation. 
I also have be good at Data Structure and Algorithm
Little Bit about myself:
Top 8% ( 458 reputation ) in Stack Overflow in 2021 ( https://stackoverflow.com/users/14302873/mrpmohiburrahman ) 
I am working as a React Native Developer since 30th December, 2020.
I do not have any kind project to show case
I am willing to work with anything as long as it’s Functional Programming with JS.
This is my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrpmohiburrahman/
What do you suggest?
How can I prepare myself so that I’ll be able to join FAANG as a Front End developer or as JS developer on any stack?

        <link href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29078533"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm really confused on this. My understanding on Golang's intentions and design is that it is an intentionally simple language lacking most of traditional OO features. The language is relying on interfaces (and Generics?) for doing most of the things you'd do with classic OO.
Yet I see job ads requiring and even classes teaching Design Pattterns with Golang. And by inquiry I see that they're not talking about Golang-specific DPs (that would make sense) but about fitting traditional OO DPs (and principles like SOLID) to Golang. Which in turn seems to me like bending the language to something it was not designed for in order to fit into models we developed for traditional OO languages like java and C++.
Unsure what is going on here and what the consensus on best practice is (if any).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bootstrap Icons v1.7.0 is here with 120 new and updated icons, taking us over 1,500 total icons for the project! It’s the largest update since the initial release, so keep reading to see what’s new.
120 new icons
This update was a lot of fun for me—drawing all these tiny computer parts most of all! There are dozens of new computer related icons for parts, ports, and peripheral devices. There are also several new brand icons, including Meta, and some other fun icons like a new robot head and a boombox.
Looking for more new icons? Head to the issue tracker to check for open requests or submit a new one.
Install
To get started, install or update via npm:
npm i bootstrap-icons


Or Composer:
composer require twbs/bootstrap-icons


You can also download the release from GitHub, or download just the SVGs and fonts (without the rest of the repository files).
Figma
The Figma file is now published to the Figma Community! It’s the same Bootstrap Icons Figma file you’ve seen from previous releases, just a little more accessible to those using the app.]]></summary>

The demo sets the play-state of the animation depending on the user’s motion preferences (using the prefers-reduced-motion media query). Users could also click the button to toggle motion on and off, which also changes the text of the button to “Turn on motion” or “Turn off motion”. Here’s the original version:

This blog post is about the implementation of DevTools support for debugging Content Security Policy (CSP) issues with the help of the recently introduced Issues tab.
The implementation work was done in the course of 2 internships:
During the first one, we built the general reporting framework and designed the issue messages for 3 CSP violation issues.
During the second one, we added Trusted Type issues alongside some specialized DevTools features for Trusted Types debugging.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first half of 2022, Chrome will reach a three-digit major version number:
100!  When browsers first reached version 10 many eons ago,
lots of issues were discovered
with User-Agent parsing libraries as the major version number went from one
digit to two.  Now that we are approaching version 100 in both Chrome and
Firefox, with Edge not far behind, we want to detect possible issues related
to three-digit version number early, so we are ready when it becomes a reality.
Starting in Chrome 96, until Chrome 99, a feature flag will be available to force the User-Agent
string to use the major version number 100, regardless of the actual major version
number. It will apply to both the User-Agent request header and the Javascript
APIs (for example, navigator.userAgent).
Similar experiments
are being run on Firefox as well.
Visit
Is Chrome 100 yet? to
check if your browser is sending the major version 100 in the User-Agent
string.
To turn the flag on in Chrome and experiment, type chrome://flags in the address bar and enable
the #force-major-version-to-100 flag.
Visiting
Is Chrome 100 yet?
after enabling the flag reports that the User-Agent has major version number 100.
The goal is to uncover as many issues as possible ahead of time, so send your
bug reports to
Web Compat
and help prepare the web for three-digit major browser version numbers!]]></summary>

It began on Thursday morning with the first Salter Cane band practice in eighteen months. That was pretty safe—three of us in a room, reminding ourselves of how the songs go. I honestly thought it could’ve been a disaster and that I wouldn’t remember anything, but thanks to a little bit of last-minute revision the evening before, it actually went really well. And boy, did it feel good to plug in and play those songs again.
Later that day, Jessica went up to London. We spent that evening in the Royal Opera House, watching a ballet, The Dante Project. We wore masks. Not everyone else did.

The book I found to be better (than the film - sorry purists - I know I shouldn't compare!), though I couldn't stop hearing Alan Rickman's voice as Marvin.
I did sort of feel like nothing actually happened in the book. It was an adventure, but I think I missed the character arcs - or… I wasn't sure where to look!

Being a “digital person” could be scary—if I don’t have control over the hardware I’m running on, then someone else could get my code and run tons of copies in horrible conditions. (See also: qntm’s Lena.)
It would be great to guarantee digital people some control over their situation: 1. to control their local environment and sensations, 2. to avoid unauthorized rewinding or duplicating.
I’ll describe how you could modify the code of a digital person so that they retain this control even if an adversary has access to their source code. This would be very expensive with current cryptography. I think the overhead will eventually become cheap enough that it’s possible to do for some digital people, though it will likely remain expensive enough that …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are there any, or can we maybe come up with (i.e. suggestions please if it seems like a good idea), HTTP headers that browsers can send to sites that automatically instruct them in terms of:
1. The kinds of cookies I'm willing to accept (e.g. strictly necessary). For example, `X-Prefer-Cookies: strictly-necessary` or `X-Prefer-Cookies: all`.
2. The fact that I don't, and probably never will, care about your newsletter. (If your content really interests me, I'll find a way through your UI to subscribe.) For example: `X-Offer-Newsletter: no`, or `X-Offer-Newsletter: yes`.
If you wanted to facilitate more general UX preference indications from the client side, you could potentially come up with a scheme like `X-UX-Preferences: strictly-necessary-cookies; no-newsletters`.
This way I can set these preferences once in my browser and be done with your annoying cookie selection and newsletter popups (if your site honours those headers, of course).
I think that, if most websites honoured those headers, it might just fix 80% of what I personally feel is wrong with the modern web. (The other 20% I think involves completely eradicating online advertising-driven business models from the face of the planet, which I think is quite a bit harder to achieve than this.)
