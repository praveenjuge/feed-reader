          <p>Spooky season has come and gone. We’ve put away our trademark giant inflatable Beetlejuice sandworm. Halloween in our neighborhood is a great time. Almost everyone pitches in to make it special for the hundreds of kids that take to our streets. A genuine piece of Americana.
There’s been a bit of sporting going on in October. Otis wrapped up his fall baseball season. Otis’ team didn’t have the greatest season but I think learning the lesson “not all seasons are bangers” is a good lesson. I did scorekeeping for the team which is not too difficult, but its one of those jobs no one volunteers for.

Are there any less intense ways to follow the links that pop up here, whatever &#x27;less intense&#x27; might mean to you? Maybe just posts that hit the top 10, maybe only posts that linger on the front page for a certain amount of time.

          <p>I would like to move away from CMS that I&#x27;m using to GitHub pages. I think that the easiest way is to use my RSS feed as source, but I don&#x27;t know how to convert. I get it that not everything can be converted, but just to manage to get the images and text out and formated right it would be great.
My second option is to copy HTML source code, but I don&#x27;t think that GitHub pages support all of the HTML tags.

          <p>MakePlace is a PC app that lets you drag-and-drop furniture and edit floorplans. The goal is to make interior design easy and fun, like playing with Lego.
It started off as an app to simulate housing in an MMORPG, since the furniture system there was atrocious. I&#x27;m now trying to adapt it as a simulator for general interior design.
Like many 3D design software, there are a bunch of tools and controls, and first-time users may feel somewhat lost. So I&#x27;ve made a starting tutorial to help ease users into the controls. Do you think the tutorial works well?
Let me know what else can be improved!

          <p>I have a rails app and I need to build a good UI for my website. It has a form and requires CRUD operations and has 3/4 pages. The backend is in place, but I&#x27;m not quite comfortable with the UI part. I need to build a UI that is responsive. Are there any recommended drap/drop UI builders that can export the required HTML/CSS that I can just shove into my existing rails app?
Sites like wordpress will allow me to create a UI and some backend but it is a new backend that I&#x27;ll need to learn. I&#x27;d rather keep the backend as rails as I&#x27;m comfortable with it, so it&#x27;ll be faster for me to build on it.

          <p>I would like to move away from CMS that I&#x27;m using to GitHub pages. I think that the easiest way is to use my RSS feed as source, but I don&#x27;t know how to convert. I get it that not everything can be converted, but just to manage to get the images and text out and formated right it would be great.
My second option is to copy HTML source code, but I don&#x27;t think that GitHub pages support all of the HTML tags.

          <p>Hey,
when I started this newsletter in 2013, I’d never imagined to writing this for nine years, to have thousands of subscribers via email, and many more via the website, social media, and the RSS feed. With many ups and downs, changes in schedule, and ups and downs in motivation, I’m glad to have this project still alive, to get feedback from my dear readers (you), and seem to have a positive impact on web developers’ work lives. This is what still motivates me today.
But what remains open is the question of monetarizing this project. I have always accepted contributions, but they decline every year. And while the monthly schedule brings a bit more flexibility, writing the newsletter is the big chunk of work. Right now, I’m happy if the contributions at least pay my hosting and sending bi…</p>

          <p>The Storage Standard defines an API for persistent storage and
quota estimates, and the platform storage architecture. It&#x27;s available behind the
#enable-experimental-web-platform-features flag in Chromium 106, and we&#x27;d love your feedback.
# What problem does the storage standard aim to solve?
Traditionally, as the user runs out of storage space on their device, the data stored with APIs like
IndexedDB or localStorage gets lost without the user being able to intervene. A way to make
storage persistent is through invoking the
persist() method of the
StorageManager interface. It simultaneously requests the end user for permission and changes the
storage to be persistent once granted:
const persisted &#x3D; await navigator.storage.persist();
if (persisted) {

          <p>I recently built a tool to manage and store RSS Feeds in Notion. 
The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t auto save the HTML into notion page (this would required parsing HTML into Notion objects). I started on this with [html2notion](https://github.com/Jeadie/html2notion), but it turned out to be alot of work.
With Notion already having a [Notion web clipper](https://www.notion.so/web-clipper), I was wondering if it was worth implementing? Personally I read a small fraction of the blog posts from my RSS feed, and I like the spare page to take notes. For me, notion-rss solves the one core problem I have, acquiring and filtering high quality RSS feeds. What does HN think?

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;33419574 target="_blank">Ask HN: How would you design an alternative Twitter</a>
          <p>So much talk about Twitter alternatives in recent days, including people migrating to Mastodon and even Jack Dorsey announcing his new decentralized social media platform.
I was thinking, if I was to build a new micro-blogging aka Twitter alternative, what technological choices would I make to get it quickly off the ground but allow for scale?
What database technology or approach would you go for?
Would you build a (mobile first) web application first or would you start straight away with a native iOS/Android app (maybe Flutter)?
Would you go for a centralised or decentralized approach? If the latter, how would you decentralize it without sacrificing the &quot;public town square&quot; effect that Twitter currently has but is clearly lacking with the fragmentation of Mastodon?
To answer my own question, I would probably build a centralized platform like Twitter is now, probably opt for a fast NoSQL database like Google&#x27;s Firestore in Datastore mode and to keep things simple I would probably even make sure that tweets would get automatically deleted after some years as I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s needed to build a forever growing database of people&#x27;s thoughts in that moment that persists for decades to come. Micro-blogging always felt to me as a thing right now, a thought in this moment but that thought could be different in a few days, months and definitely a few years, so why store it forever. Feels like I could save a huge operational cost and prevent abuse by not keeping tweets for beyond their relevancy.
What are your thoughts?

          <p>If building a GraphQL API backed by a native graph database sounds interesting or at all helpful for the problems you’re trying to solve as a developer, perhaps you’d like to give the open-source [Neo4j GraphQL Library](https://srv.buysellads.com/ads/long/x/TCZPLYDDTTTTTTFR6JINCTTTTTTGVUIVKKTTTTTTCT2NTYYTTTTTTI4BVH7U4JBCKQ466IDGV2IUWESGCV7WALL5QYYE) a try.

          <p>As a software engineer that lives too much of his life on a computer, I like keeping my machine as clean as possible. I don’t keep rogue downloaded files and removes apps when I don’t need them. Part of keeping a clean, performant system is removing empty directories. To identify empty directories, I use the […]

          <p>Infinity is seductive. 1,000 emails take up just as much space (and cost just as much) as one. An online bookstore can carry every book ever published. And the long tail of music gives every single person a chance to share their work. The simplest thing to do is “let the market sort itself out.” […]</p>

          <p>On the Chrome team, we are constantly amazed by the pace of innovation on the web. Since the launch of the Chrome Web Store (CWS), our goal has been to enable the creation of innovative and useful products, and we couldn&#x27;t do this without a rich community of developers. As the variety of products offered on CWS has evolved over the years, we&#x27;ve received some important feedback regarding how our policies are written and enforced. We agree that we can do better to make our policies clearer to developers and to enforce them in a way that does not come at the expense of good-intentioned developers who provide useful products.
To that end, we&#x27;ve decided to provide more context on our policies and our general philosophy for the evolution of the Chrome Web Store. Through this update, we hope to b…</p>

          <p>I have a dream of making a cringe detector - a program that you could input a tweet or image, and it outputs how cringy it is.
I am thinking, it could use a neural net, or not necessary.
I was trying to imagine, how could that thing work? And actually out of clue.
What do you think?

          <p>I&#x27;m wondering if HTML/CSS is a good option if you want to leave content for your grandchildren.
Not just text but fully interactive web-pages that load images and videos.
I&#x27;m fairly certain there will always be some sort of compatibility mode, but for a general audience, I&#x27;m wondering if in 30 years, browsers (or their equivalent) would have moved to something closer to a canvas rendering model or something that makes accessing this data difficult.

          <p>cssminc is a CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) minifier implemented as a tiny, dependency-free, C89-compliant library which can read CSS from arbitrary sources (via a callback) and emit it in minified form to an arbitrary destination (via a callback).
Its library-level code is only 2 files (one header, one implementation) and it includes an optional CLI app which demonstrates how it&#x27;s used.

Frameworks like MooTools and Prototype extended prototypes while jQuery and other smaller frameworks did not. Each had their benefits, but ultimately all these years later I still believe that the ability to extend native prototypes is a […]

          <p>This is obvious. Circus peanuts don’t have nuts, legumes or anything else that resembles a nut. They’re a metaphor. Or perhaps a simile, it depends on your level of pedantry. And yet, many people have a hard time with metaphor. Metaphor, not memorization, is the heart of learning. If you understand A, and you see […]</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;33390423 target="_blank">Ask HN: Books covering best practices in advanced multithreaded design in C++</a>
          <p>I&#x27;m looking for books or online resources showing best practices in use of atomics, barriers and locks in the design of multithreaded realtime applications in C++. I am specifically looking for actual implementation examples and architecture examples and not just covering the basic theory or use.
Background/context:
I am working on an application where I need to share various datastructures between threads. I&#x27;ve been using atomics but as the complexity grows it becomes hard to review code for &quot;correctness&quot;. My goal is to avoid holding locks for long periods of time. Since this is a realtime application I also want to avoid waiting. So lock-free, wait-free is preferred.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;33394730 target="_blank">Ask HN: Is speed of delivery the most important metric in productivity?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;m fairly new to the field and relatively late to the party (because I&#x27;m old), but a recurring theme that I&#x27;m noticing in my current company (which is a small startup) is how the faster you deliver the better you look to the CEO and even CTO&#x27;s eyes.
In hour fairly infrequent meetings other engineers have raised the point that we should start valuing code quality and proper testing to our codebase, only to be met with arguments such as &quot;the customer doesn&#x27;t pay for good code&quot;.
Furthermore, most likely an anecdotal bias and nothing else but I want to mention it: Online elitism revolves around shipping speed too. Comments like &quot;I can build X in Y hours&quot;, &quot;I can skim the docs and build what I want with Z library in less than a day&quot;, and so on.
How does everyone feel about it? Maybe it&#x27;s just me but it feels weird. It&#x27;s kinda like everyone I mentioned feels like there are no trade-offs to be concerned in regards to speed over quality or people decided that there&#x27;s no reason to bother ourselves with contemplating what we&#x27;re trading off speed with. Also, I feel that because quality is subjective and perfect is the enemy of done, people rely on objective metrics like &quot;time taken&quot;.
Is there truth and merit to this observation?

          <p>I’ve spent the last week or so cleaning, purging, and reorganizing my office. I had encapsulated myself in a micro-hoarder situation in the shed which made it difficult to get focused. Clutter, as I’m learning, is adversarial to my distractible brain. One task that’s been looming over my head was this box of file folders.
This box of file folders was a collection of all expenses and tax documents from the years 2012-2016. And I mean everything. Every gas, electric, internet, and credit card bill that came to my house. Every business expense. Every health expense. Every mortgage payment. The reason I hoarded all these documents? Self-employment. All those numbers factor into my tax bill every year, so I kept every physical document that was relevant. America glamorizes starting your own bus…</p>

          <p>If you like me have many events during the day, you are probably also tired by constant switching to Mac Calendar or Google Calendar just to check when the next event starts. I searched for a widget that would show me upcoming events in some &quot;always visible&quot; way, but all apps showed the schedule in a separate window. So I decided to make a new app that would show a schedule right in a Dock icon.
More to this, My Upcoming Events shows a countdown in the same Dock icon several minutes before the start of the event, which is handy for me, so I can start right on time.
Limitations: MacOS, Google Calendar only.

          <p>The only two possible filters on the list of videos of a channel now are most recent and most popular.
I know it&#x27;s a small thing but somehow this hits me really hard.
Also, there&#x27;s less videos on a single row now. Because we can&#x27;t read more than that without our attention span going poof.

          <p>I’ve been working on a little site to replace Nuzzle after Twitter acquired and shut it down last year. The basic idea is that you connect your Twitter account and receive a unique RSS feed that gives you all the links that would show up in your Twitter timeline. I mostly built it for myself but given all the Twitter drama, I figure there are people out there like me who want to escape the commentary, but still value the links people share.
Please give it a try! If you encounter bugs or want to give feedback, you can drop a comment here or message me on Twitter at @kdamica.

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/viewport-resize-behavior/ target="_blank">Prepare for viewport resize behavior changes coming to Chrome on Android</a>
          <p>In November, with the release of Chrome 108, Chrome will make some changes to how the Layout Viewport behaves when the on-screen keyboard (OSK) gets shown. With this change, Chrome on Android will no longer resize the Layout Viewport, and instead resize only the Visual Viewport. This will bring Chrome on Android’s behavior up to par with that of Chrome on iOS and Safari on iOS.
Here&#x27;s some background on what&#x27;s happening, why Chrome is making this change, and what you can do to prepare.
# The Layout Viewport and the Visual Viewport
When visiting a website, you don’t get to see the entire page&#x27;s contents after it has loaded. Instead, the browser offers you a viewport through which you get to see a portion of the page. This viewport is also known as the Layout Viewport. When the content of a …</p>

Learn more about the features listed here through the provided links or from the list on ChromeStatus.com. Chrome 108 is beta as of October 27, 2022. You can download the latest on Google.com for desktop or on Google Play Store on Android.
# CSS
Chrome 108 includes a number of new CSS features.
# CSS Overflow for replaced elements
Chrome will start to roll out a change that allows developers to use the existing overflow property with replaced elements that paint outside the content-box. Paired with object-view-box this can be used to create an image with a custom glow or shadow applied, with proper ink-overflow behavior like a CSS shadow would ha…</p>

          <p>The Payment Handler API
allows payment providers to make their custom payment experience available for
merchants, along with the Payment Request
API. When the Payment Request
API is initialized via the
new PaymentRequest() constructor, it silently fires a canmakepayment event with
the merchant&#x27;s origin and arbitrary data to
a service worker that is registered for the Payment Handler API.
This cross-origin communication does not require a user gesture and does not
show any user interface.
Chrome is going to remove the identifying fields from canmakepayment event
and start the origin trial from Chrome 108.
The information on this page only applies to the payment app providers that use
the Payment Handler API. If you don&#x27;t use it, you can skip these instructions.

          <p>In the course of my work I sometimes find myself needing to mock API requests — often when I’m prototyping, or testing a concept for an article. There are a couple of useful (free) tools I reach for on these occasions.
n:point
n:point provides lightweight, publicly accessible API endpoints for your JSON data. It’s super easy to use: simply give it some JSON and it sets up an endpoint in seconds. No messing about with access tokens, it’s ideal if you just want to fetch some data. You can also define and lock the JSON schema. I’m using n:point for a Codrops article on creating an interactive line graph based on timeseries data.
Mockeroo
If you need to actually generate some data, Mockeroo is a tool that enables you to do just that. You can add rows of different types and Mockeroo will generate random data. There are configuration options, including setting ranges (for numbers and dates, for example), and including null values. If you’re happy writing Ruby, you can also include formulas and you can download the data in different formats.
I’ve only used Mockeroo for generating JSON, but you can also create API endpoints. It’s not as quick as n:point to set up, but looks useful if you need to mock any more complex API requests.</p>

          <p>The
origin private file system
provides access to a special kind of file that is highly optimized for performance, for example, by
offering in-place and exclusive write access to a file&#x27;s content. Developers can get access to such
files by calling
createSyncAccessHandle(),
which is a method exposed on
FileSystemFileHandle objects. This call
results in a FileSystemSyncAccessHandle.
The createSyncAccessHandle() method and therefore FileSystemSyncAccessHandle is only
exposed in Workers. It is not available in the main thread. 


FileSystemSyncAccessHandle is a file primitive that provides performant access to local files. One
of its main use cases is applications porting C/C++ code to Wasm; however, asynchronous calls are
not fully supported on Wasm yet, and using the

There are new properties in the Screen Capture API to improve the screen sharing experiences.

There is a new way to send data to a backend server with the declarative PendingBeacon API in origin trial. And there’s plenty more.

In this version the Screen Capture API adds new properties to improve the screen sharing experiences.
The DisplayMediaStreamConstraints added the selfBrowserSurface property. With this hint the application can tell the browser that when calling getDisplayMedia() the current tab should be excluded.

          <p>I have a regrettable habit of folding my legs on the chair when working and hunch back, which is unhealthy.
Anyone who had struggled with something similar in the past, please share your advice and experience.
BTW, I also have ADHD which comes with challenge of behavior inhibition.

It’s standard these days to use that preference to show the dark or light theme on a given website. But what if the user changes their preference while using your app?

          <p>This week, no sooner than October 26, we will begin increasing the Privacy
Sandbox Relevance and Measurement origin trial population towards 5% of Chrome
Stable users. We always take an incremental approach to increasing limits and
actively monitor for issues in Chrome origin trials–you can expect to see
traffic levels increase over a period of a few days. Pre-stable channels, Canary
and Beta will continue as is with a 50/50 split for origin trial eligibility.
We brought the trial to Chrome Stable in
August to enable functional testing
in a real, production environment—and the results helped us improve API
stability, developer documentation, and support. We are increasing the scale of
this testing to 5% to continue functional testing through 2022 and prepare for
utility testing in 2023.

We are on the path towards phasing out third-party cookies across the web

On the surface, cookies provide a simple key-value store that&#x27;s sent between the

I am trying to find an article I read, possibly posted on HN, about how mobile operating systems are becoming/could become the de facto unified messaging interface across multiple instant messaging apps due to the ubiquity of push notifications and the prevalence of contacts on share sheets.
As I recall, it was primary a UI/UX-focused article.
Unfortunately after an hour of trying various search combinations I have not come up with anything. I&#x27;m pretty sure it was an article published after 2019.
Hopefully someone remembers this and can share the link with me in the comments.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;33294641 target="_blank">Ask HN: Help finding good embedded DSP design resources?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;m working on an LED art project that combines a few realtime signals; audio and some other inputs to inform the visuals. I&#x27;m running things on an ESP32 right now and doing an FFT and some other sort of seat-of-the-pants DSP stuff on one core while the other handles bluetooth, LED control, etc. I&#x27;ve got some time to mess around and I&#x27;d like to get a broad strokes overview of the embedded DSP field to inform myself on where to explore next. I&#x27;ve got a fair bit of hands on experience but little formal training.
Ultimately the goal is to *make good art* so I&#x27;m not really looking for anything specific. In my head I&#x27;ll get some good papers/textbooks/libraries/articles recommended to me and then I&#x27;ll spend a few weeks to write toy implementations of whatever seems interesting in C to get a feel for the space.
I&#x27;m particularly looking for the nitty-gritty type stuff, cool hacks that save cycles and improve latency, my goal here is visceral reactivity and I&#x27;d like to get some more tools in my toolkit that allow me to interpret and combine signals in realtime in interesting ways. Even info on cool math hacks like Carmack&#x27;s fast inverse square root would be appreciated.
P.S. Also of interest is material on debugging and modelling realtime code.

          <p>This is my background image.
I set:
    background-position:50% 50%;
I get this as my output:
But I don’t understand the output.
So, I read little bit about background-position again.
&gt;A value such as 20% 65% specifies that the point 20% across and 65% down the image be placed at the point 20% across and 65% down the element.
https://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/css/color-background/background-position.html
&gt;With a value pair of &#x27;14% 84%&#x27;, the point 14% across and 84% down the image is to be placed at the point 14% across and 84% down the padding area.
https://wiki.cdot.senecacollege.ca/wiki/CSS_GUIDE_BACKGROUND_POSITION
&gt;A horizontal value of 25% positions the point 25% from the left edge of the image at a point that is 25% from the left edge of the background positioning area.
“Learning web design” by Jenniver Nierdest Robbins
If I wanted to put the background image at the center using the “percentage percentage”, how’d I do it? (50% 0% doesn’t work).
Sadly, I still don’t get it.
My HTML Code:
    
    
Document
        

My CSS code:
    body{
        background-color:yellowgreen;
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        background-image: url(../images/circle.png);
        background-position:50% 0%;
       
    }

          <p>I recently started using AWS for my new job, and am currently stuck with CloudWatch for logs. I used to dislike Graylog because of the clunky interface, but I just cannot extract anything from CloudWatch! My logs are there, I can view them but it&#x27;s impossible to query them:
- on the Log Streams page, the pagination doesn&#x27;t work, I can only view page 1
- if I do &quot;Search all streams&quot; with a basic filter (something like &#x60;foo &#x3D; &quot;bar&quot;&#x60;) it doesn&#x27;t return anything (I know there are some matches I can see them)
- Logs Insights is limited to the last 3 hours of logs
Is there an alternative CloudWatch interface somewhere that would allow me to finally query my logs? I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s a CLI, a heavy client or a webpage, I just want to query my logs...

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;33275657 target="_blank">What&#x27;s the difference between CSS “em” and “rem”?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;ve read this much about this:
1) Learning Web Design
Book by Jennifer Niederst Robbins
1 rem&#x3D; 1* browser&#x27;s default font size
1 em&#x3D; depends on the element type, for h1 it&#x27;s something, for h2, it&#x27;s sth else.
2) https://css-tricks.com/confused-rem-em/
&gt;While em is relative to the font-size of its direct or nearest parent, rem is only relative to the html (root) font-size.
I get the rem part, but not the em part. What does it mean?
3) https://blog.logrocket.com/using-em-vs-rem-css/#:~:text&#x3D;Let%27s%20get%20started!-,What%20are%20em%20and%20rem%20and%20why%20use%20them%3F,relative%20to%20a%20set%20value.
I&#x27;ve read this as well but since I&#x27;m only knowing html and starting to learn css, I could not get most of the things written there.
4) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;tlRLEsZa89M
I watch this short video. It does makes things somewhat clear about &quot;inherits from parent&quot;.
Anyway, I am eager to learn the crux of &quot;em&quot;. Maybe with some code examples, or figures(if it&#x27;s lying anywhere in internet)

          <p>It’s been some years since Tab Atkins-Bittner first proposed Cascading Attribute Sheets. I had a situation come up which made me think about them again and I thought I’d share.
On my site I have a handful of blog posts which have a title and/or text content in different languages. As someone who speaks a handful of languages, I like incorporating different languages, phrases, and untranslatable words into my day-to-day blogging. 「手答え」(tegotae) is an example of one of those words. It directly translates to “hand response” but is sometimes translated as “haptic feedback” or “game feel” when used in a video game context.
One problem with my use of other languages is that I’m lacking proper lang attributes on the foreign text, which makes it inaccessible. I’ve started brainstorming ways out of…</p>

          <p>The YouTube gods surfaced me a video of classical guitarist Brandon Acker comparing a $200 guitar, a $2,000 guitar, a $20,000 guitar, and a $200,000 guitar. As you step up in orders of magnitude in cost, you start to see what creates value: the materials, the resonance, the sustain, the ease of playability. I’ve played guitar all my life and I never even imagined $200,000 guitars existed. I won’t spoil which one is the best but the result is shocking! Every guitarist I’ve talked to that’s seen this video had the same reaction.
tl;dr- I would love to see someone do this with websites.
Bonus: Building a classical guitar from scratch

If you want a behind the scenes look at what goes into making a $20,000 guitar, musician and YouTuber Rob Scallon spends a week+ building a classical guitar with the same classical guitar luthier from the previous video,  Marshall Bruné. It’s a two hour video and I gobbled up every minute. Planks of wood and chunks of bone transformed through bending, shaving, sanding, gluing, and polishing; a transfiguration into a masterpiece. Incredible.
As mentioned in other carpentry videos I’ve watched, I love the little glimpses into the bespoke tools experts create to do their job well; the benders, the shapers, the hole cutters. The processes too! The fretboards are aged a minimum of seven years in a humidity controlled environment! How would you even know to do that without centuries of institutional knowledge? It’s interesting to see where these masters of their craft draw the line on what to do bespoke (the body) and where to leverage prefabrication and modern machinery (the neck).

          <p>What&#x27;s the best book to learn CSS for beginners except Jon duckett and head first? (Problem: I need to print these books as they&#x27;re not available to purchase, and neither of these books are printable).

          <p>Hi HN,
I&#x27;ve recently gone through a few interviews where I did poorly on system design questions like &quot;design twitter.&quot; The interviewers expressed a wish to see me go more in depth on technologies, but I simply don&#x27;t have much experience in any of them, as my current role is heavily ML focused and issues of scaling were long-ago solved by my large employer.
My question is are there any recommendations for ways to get more experience on system design? For most things it&#x27;d be as simple as &quot;start a project revolving around X&quot; but for scaling.. you kind of need users first. Was wondering how to get around this problem.
Thanks

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/rename-trust-tokens/ target="_blank">Trust Tokens renamed Private State Tokens</a>
          <p>The origin trial for Private State Tokens (previously known as Trust Tokens) is now closed.
API status updates will be provided on this page and on Chrome Platform Status.
# Name change
What you may have seen described as Trust Tokens will now be referred to as Private State Tokens.
Private State Tokens enable trust in a user&#x27;s authenticity to be conveyed from one context to another, to help sites combat fraud and distinguish bots from real humans without passive tracking.
# Why do we need this renaming?
The name &quot;Trust Token API&quot; was originally chosen to indicate that by using the API, websites could issue tokens to demonstrate their level of trust in the user. The tokens could then be redeemed for activity on other websites. Since then, we&#x27;ve received feedback that the name led to a misunderstanding that the API provided a signal of trust determined by the browser. The word &quot;trust&quot; has different meanings for different sites, and the website issuing the token determines the signal of trust.
We&#x27;re renaming the Trust Token API to Private State Token API to better showcase its privacy and utility benefits.
The API provides a small amount of storage to allow organizations to convey information from one context (token issuance) to another (token redemption)  in a privacy-preserving manner. The tokens are designed to help protect the user&#x27;s identity by using techniques such as cryptographic  blind signatures.
# Engage and share feedback
Demo: The Trust Tokens origin trial has closed, so the demo won&#x27;t work, but you can still view code for trust token issuance and redemption.
GitHub: Read the proposal, raise questions and follow discussion.

Seems Microsoft is trying to unify dev experience around React 
https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/wiki/FAQ---Fabric-and-Stardust-to-Fluent-UI
&quot;Our end goal is to unify these things. One styling solution, one theming solution, one set of utilities, one set of component authoring patterns, one set of components, one documentation site.&quot;
Is it mature? Worth to invest time and follow in coming years?

          <a href=https://adamsilver.io/blog/designing-a-time-input/ target="_blank">Designing a time input</a>
          <p>Entering a time is challenging because:
a time is made up of hours, minutes and a period (AM or PM)
there are many different formats for the same time like ‘12am’ ‘24:00’, 12.00am’, ‘12a.m.’ and ‘00’
Here I’ll explain why I recommend using a single text input for time.
But first, I’ll explain how to avoid the complexity of entering time in the first place.
# How to avoid making users enter a time
When it comes to forms, whenever we can help users avoid having to fill them out in the first place, we should.
When it comes to time there are certain ways to do that.
For example, I’m working on a service that has a closing time field for a job advert.

          <p>I am new to embedded PCB design. I can find lots of resources such as video tutorial or the schematics for the power, adc, dac, etc.
But I cannot find any hands-on tutorial on SDRAM, neither software nor hardware connection. I don&#x27;t know what those pins on SDRAM are for and how can I connect them to the MCU.
Is there any book about this topic?

          <p>I like to write articles about technology or to create tutorials.
I&#x27;m starting to feel the need to know how to structure them visually in a way that makes the right information standout. Sorry, if this is not very clear.
For example, I find that just using headings is not enough for this.
Does anyone have any reading resources about how to use design to improve readability? I think that&#x27;s basically what I need.

          <p>Hi HN!
Here&#x27;s what I am searching for, but haven&#x27;t found yet: a website that offers the releases of software as RSS feeds.
I imagine that after logging in, you can search and select software products (from Github, from Gitlab, or even proprietary,...). You then get one RSS feed which combines all releases into one stream.
Creating multiple streams that combine by topic, programming language or whatever would be great too.
Does something like this exist? Or something similar? I know that Github offers feeds for single projects, but it feels tedious to add like 50+ single feeds to the reader.
Thanks for any tips!

          <p>Which companies hire for hybrid Developer/Designer roles? 
I feel that sometimes that&#x27;s a really fulfilling role for some people (like me) and wondering where I could be paid for that (most jobs are either or one of the two positions).
Furthermore: has anybody worked in a similar role in a tech company and can share their experience?
Companies I&#x27;m aware already:
- Basecamp (designers owning the styling part of the FE)
- Ashby (recently saw some open positions about it but not exactly sure how it works there)
Thanks

          <p>That’s what it said on the side of the tractor-trailer on the highway. Since 1924, they’re almost 100 years old. But it’s unlikely that it’s everyone’s favorite. Being everyone’s favorite is such an attractive goal, and almost impossible to achieve. Ask someone about their favorite pie and they’ll talk about the one they ate as […]</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;33197429 target="_blank">Why is it so difficult to design digital baseband (e.g., LTE) chips?</a>
          <p>The LTE digital baseband market was famously dominated by Qualcomm, which maintained a 60+% market share for nearly a decade (2009-2019).  MediaTek also successfully entered the market, but not for high end phones for high-income markets (U.S., Europe, etc.). Famously, both Intel and Broadcom (two semiconductor firms known for their ability to design successful chips in other markets, e.g., MPUs, cable modem chips, WiFi chips, Bluetooth chips, etc.) attempted to enter the market and failed. Broadcom exited the market and wound down their LTE business unit. Intel sold its group to Apple, which now has gone on to fail to develop a 5g digital baseband solution (Apple continues to use Qualcomm for its 5g digital baseband solution).
Why (from an engineering perspective) is it so difficult to develop an advanced  LTE (or 5G) digital baseband chip such that even semiconductor powerhouses like Intel and Broadcom have struggled to develop solutions which compare to Qualcomm&#x27;s offerings?
Note - answers from semiconductor design engineers appreciated :)

I’ve looked at pidgin and Adium, so far I don’t see a zoom connector. Does anyone know of an alternative client?

Eleventy is a static site generator created by Zach Leatherman who came to this TKYT session to give me a beginner&#x27;s crash course on building static sites with Eleventy.
For folks more experienced with Eleventy, skip to the WebC portion that begins at almost exactly 1:00:00!</p>

          <p>We&#x27;re building an app that helps people manage their schedules, tasks, and notes all in one place.
The goal is to create a personal workspace where people can manage their days and weeks on a single screen, set their personal and professional priorities, access a single schedule combined of all their calendars, and navigate through their days without switching between multiple apps.
At the moment, we&#x27;ve implemented bi-directional Google calendar synchronisation, various types of tasks (e.g. daily, weekly, &quot;until done&quot;),  and basic note-taking functionality.
Also, Emery has some things we really wanted to see in other apps – private notes for meetings, group editing of overdue tasks, categories that can be used to group tasks/notes/meetings together, and weekly productivity reports.
Currently, it&#x27;s a web app for desktop. A standalone desktop app is coming soon.
Happy to hear any feedback and answer any questions!

          <p>Meta just unveiled their new Quest Pro headset. I am curious whether any of you are actually using AR/VR-Headsets on a regular basis for productive tasks.
Please share your use-case and how switching to this platform did (or perhaps didn&#x27;t) improve your productivity and overall work experience.

          <p>This is not for &#x27;deep&#x27; or &#x27;slow&#x27; reading with intention and focus. The idea is that you have a large pool of incoming stories and you aren&#x27;t interested in &#x27;reading&#x27; all of them, but you want to reduce the chance of missing a single story. You want to &#x27;screen&#x27; all stories.
This UI explores a &#x27;mark-and-clear&#x27; idiom; you mark a group of stories as &#x27;read&#x27; and then you clear that group, purging the stories from your view completely.

          <p>I have a systems design interview coming up, and I&#x27;ve never participated in one before. What can I expect to be asked? 
Is it a high level design to talk through, or is in an in depth design, trying to justify different services and weighing up the pros and cons of aws v azure etc?

          <p>The Chrome team has been working hard to build new capabilities, though we&#x27;re
responsible for only a small fraction of the work. Web app developers depend
on countless others in the community to build a strong ecosystem of APIs, tools,
demonstration apps, and other materials. That&#x27;s why earlier this year, we
announced the Advanced Web Apps Fund.
We&#x27;ve sponsored 11 projects, distributing more than $100k through the
Open Collective,
to recognize the importance of these projects and enable their creators to
spend time on them. These projects include:
Espruino Web IDE: makes coding Espurino boards
as easy as opening a web browser.
iPlug2: a free open source framework
for making audio plugins with minimal code.
PocketBase: open source realtime backend with
embedded database, real time subscript…</p>

          <p>Hello,
I built this web UI to merge multiple tree based e-commerce categories into one &quot;super tree&quot;.
You can export the super tree as JSON, and import it into another system such as a search engine.
Users can then select a single category and view items from all of the semantically equal categories.
The app is here: https://app.tree-merge.com/
You can download the sample categories and use them to demo the UI.

There are two actions that I’ve been frequently using with test writing: skipping all but one test or single tests. […]

          <p>Container queries are a new CSS feature that enables you to write styling logic that targets features of a parent element (for example, its width or height) to style its children. Recently, a big update to the polyfill was released, coinciding with support landing in browsers.
In this post, you will be able to take a peek inside how the polyfill works, the challenges it overcomes, and the best practices when using it to provide a great user experience for your visitors.
# Under the hood
# Transpilation
When the CSS parser inside a browser encounters an unknown at-rule, like the brand new @container rule, it will simply discard it as if it never existed. Therefore, the first and most important thing the polyfill must do is transpile an @container query into something that won’t be discarded…</p>

          <p>Hi HN,
My friend tries to land her first job as UX. She had a maternity break from work, was working as buildings designer before. I can see she is slowly descending into depression since she gets rejected without being given feedback. Most recently she has gone through a series of interviews with the company, got to the final stage and was rejected- without any feedback. And this after investing her time into preparing assignments and taking tests...
I try to coach her out from depressive thoughts she is getting, but it&#x27;s not really helping. If I was running a company I would take her onboard, she wants to be UX but I think she would do whatever the current need would be to provide value.
Do you know of anyone looking to get junior UX? Any advice would be of great value to her, thanks in advance!

          <p>HTML is over 29 years old today. You must have used it in many projects during your career.
Perhaps the first time was modifying MySpace or some 90s/2000s social media site.

Which of your needs are not being met with HTML as it is today?

          <p>The optic nerve dominates. It’s piped directly into our brains and uses a lot of processing power to help us discern the world through vision.
