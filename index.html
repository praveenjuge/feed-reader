          <a href=https://github.com/geoffsdavis/tape-measure target="_blank">Show HN: TapeMeasure – Swift class for creating segmented, labeled lines in UI</a>
          <p>TapeMeasure is a utility class, written in Swift, for generating a visual tape measure, or any other graphical elements that need layout in a measured sequence.
I created this class to help with a pet project I&#x27;m working on, where I needed to generate segmented, labeled lines to use as axes on charts and graphs. It occurred to me that this seems to be a pretty common task, involving a lot of boilerplate code and tedious calculations. Why not decouple the code and move it into a dedicated class? It&#x27;s self-contained, nice and simple, and easy to unit test.
It can also handle a lot of tweaks to the &quot;tape measure&quot;, such as boundary clipping and shifting offsets. It&#x27;s especially good for animation, where you can just change a parameter or two during animation, and call for the re-calculated data to re-render your measured line. That makes it great for animated sliding and scaling effects.
Anyway, enjoy!

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32276120 target="_blank">How we renamed our Design Converter to Magical Ass</a>
          <p>So here we go, our rebranding is done. New logo, new domain, what could go wrong.
We provide a tool to convert design files between Figma, XD, Sketch, Figma, PDF and more and have recently rebranded it from &quot;XD2Sketch&quot; to &quot;Magicul&quot;. We started out as a simple tool to allow users to import XD files in Sketch hence the name XD2Sketch but soon added more features. The name just didn&#x27;t make sense anymore. Magicul initially seemed to be a great name, but turned out to be a bit of an interesting pick when translated to French.
We&#x27;ve sent out a newsletter to our customers to let them know about the changes and here&#x27;s what one of our users replied:
Hey folks,
While I understand that you guys probably hope to operate primarily in English, I think it needs to be mentioned that your brand name &quot;Magicul&quot; in french, literally means &quot;Magical ass&quot;... but the real kicker is the .io of the domain, which literally means input &amp; output...
So here goes the bad news... The entire french community is reading your brand name - literally - as: Magical ass (dot) in &amp; out.
And then there&#x27;s the logo itself... which is a hole with a hat.
Christ. You can&#x27;t make this stuff up. This is ugh, umm, a brutally unfortunate brand?...lol
I&#x27;m in Quebec, Canada, where french is dominant and so I&#x27;m keenly aware of this - and so are my partners, colleagues and friends. We all had a good laugh.
Don&#x27;t know what else to say...?
Bonne chance mes amis!
Have a good one,
- A fan of your work in Montreal.

I just thought this was too hilarious to not share.

          <p>I’m not dying, but before I do I want to share with you — future generations of rockers — what I know about putting on a live music rock show.
The audience’s energy will match your energy. If you stand like a turd on the stage, they audience will stand like a bunch of turds. If you bob your head, they’ll bob their heads. If you move around, they’ll move around. If you show low confidence, they’ll have low confidence in you and start checking out.
Don’t let your band drama show on stage. Every band has drama, but don’t let it show on stage. The audience isn’t there for that.
Practice setting up and tearing down efficiently. Don’t make the audience wait and don’t be “that guy” who drags out setup extra long as some weirdo passive-aggressive attention seeking move. See previous rule.
No matter how big the stage, setup as close to each other as possible. Look and feel like a combined unit of people making music. Trust me, it will be more impressive.
The bassist and the drummer should stand next to each other. It’s all about the bass guitar and the kick drum locking in together.
Never leave the van unattended during load-in or load-out. If you haven’t had your gear stolen at this point, it’s a miracle.
Lead guitar gets the attention, but the bass guitar brings the sex. Flashy medleys get attention, but people feel the bass, no matter how boring.
Don’t riff stage banter. It’s hard to be witty on the fly unless you are very, very witty. Have some prepared goofs or smalltalk.
Make friends with the soundboard operator. This person ultimately controls how good you sound and can make or break you.
“Come forward to the stage” is at best a one-time suggestion. You can’t control people, never ask more than once.</p>

          <p>Blogging. The quintessential starter project for most—if not all—site generators. Here’s a few samples:
Next.js guides new developers to Learn Next.js “by creating a very simple blog app.”
Gatsby’s tutorial guides folks to create their “first Gatsby site: a blog site…”
Remix’s home page has a prominent Get Started call to action button that links to their Blog Tutorial.
Given that Markdown is a very popular document format for blogging, this gives us the opportunity to compare the performance of different site generators for this pervasive use case (highlighted on each generator’s documentation, as noted above).
Let’s see how each generator stacks up when consuming markdown files from the local project’s file system and building into a production-ready project.

          <p>At the beginning of the pandemic, Joe McCann wrote a speculative future piece called The New, New World Order (use a private tab if Medium paywalls you). Predicting the future or forecasting trends is never exact work, but Joe made some thought-provoking claims even if everything doesn’t pan out as predicted.
My favorite claim —and the one I still think about today— was the one about Cloud-work vs. Land-work. Dividing the labor force based on whether you work on the cloud or you work on the land is some sci-fi shit. A new dichotomy for a new era. I can already imagine cloud workers wearing silver jumpsuits and land workers wearing beige jumpsuits.

Jokes aside, I find Cloud-work vs. Land-work an innovative way to frame job types. It breaks away from the tired “blue collar” and “white colla…</p>

          <p>Olivia Hoskin
      Writer &amp; Design Enthusiast 

Muted colors in design can help your audiences enjoy a new peace of mind that emanates from low saturation or chroma — just like the color palettes in this collection.
Quite literally the “opposite of saturated” these designs are subtly elegant. As vivid colors of our past are slowly replaced with harmonious combinations of green, orange, beige, and other shades of “calm” we can enjoy feelings of safety, familiarity, and nurture.
Muted color palettes bring a modern and genuine look and feel to any design project. Perfect for a conscious product or brand, muted colors can be added to anything from packaging to illustrations, to logo color schemes.
📌 Pro tip: Experimenting with a muted palette? Try using a small amount of vivid color in your …</p>

Let’s say we have a group of elements, and we want them to animate in turn on a loop — such as this wavy text example. We’re calculating the animation-delay value them using a custom property corresponding to the element’s index.

With the Console API, you can:
Log, filter, and group the messages.
Interact with the current page.
Log variables.
Log and display object in various formats: tables, HTML elements, JSON objects.
Count function calls.
Display stack traces.
Measure the time elapsed between two points in code.

          <p>I&#x27;m still quite early in my career, only at my second SW Dev job. My previous position was a monolith app with arguably poor design resulting in large parts of the app being very tightly coupled when they shouldn&#x27;t be. Obviously this make testing some parts of the app very difficult  and of course those were the critical parts of them app (our integration test suite took over 24 hours to run at one point).
When I joined my current company they were in the process of breaking down their monolith into micro services which based on my work at my previous position seemed like a much better alternative. After some time here I feel like I&#x27;m unsure whether or not micro services are as amazing as they need to be but I&#x27;m currently chalking it up to my inexperience with them. It seems like there needs to be a balance of making sure that each service has a limited responsibility while also not having services too interdependent.
So basically I would like to learn more about good design practices and pitfalls to avoid. What resources have you guys used to learn more about micro services?

          <p>I discovered RSS a few days back and have been searching around for good blogs to fill my feed. 
I found a few great blogs here on HN:
[1] https://alien.slackbook.org/blog/
[2] https://acoup.blog/
[3] https://scholars-stage.org/
Are there any other active blogs that fill this template of long and deep discussions on a particular topic by an individual?
I&#x27;m particularly interested in books, philosophy and electronics blogs though any topic will do as long as it&#x27;s not deep level programming.
It doesn&#x27;t necessarily need to have an RSS feed because I&#x27;ll try some workarounds if it is interesting enough.
Though not particularly related, old-style one-man informative sites (and not blogs) are also welcome.

          <p>This summer marks the summer my kids got online. I gave them “the talk” and set down some ground rules.
Never send a photo of yourself to a stranger.
What you say online is the same as saying it in person. If you’re a mean person online, it’s the same as being mean in person.
No spamming. Conversations are a back and forth.
It’s okay to leave the chatroom if you’re uncomfortable.
Hopefully this sets a good foundation for “being online”. It’s earlier than we planned, but with friends’ travel schedules, COVID quarantines, and Texas heat advisories; parent-initiated Zooms and FaceTimes weren’t scaling. We’re now letting the kids self-govern their online hangouts through FaceTime and Messenger Kids. We’ve been conservative about what our kids can do with their devices (time limits, age/content restrictions, parent approval to download/buy, no open chat, etc) and some of those levers will stay in place, but it’s the beginning of a new era.
There’s already been some timezone-related 5:00 AM calls made, but hopefully with a bit more nudging around social norms this goes well.</p>

          <p>Hello HN, my name is Chris. My team and I are excited to announce the launch of our new open source UI component library called Skeleton.
We&#x27;ve been hard at work for several months and am thrilled to finally pull back the curtain. The goal is to put it out there, let folks go hands on, and gather any feedback we can. If there&#x27;s bug, a component you would like to see added etc., then we want to know so we can continue to grow and make this better for everyone.
Being open source, we welcome any contributions from the community. If you&#x27;re interested in joining, you can find us on Github:
https://github.com/Brain-Bones/skeleton
And yes, we realize that the combination of Svelte and Tailwind may place us in a niche. Personally speaking, we&#x27;ve had a lot of success with these technologies in the real world. We love what Rich Harris and his team are bringing to the frontend space with Svelte and SvelteKit, and have found Tailwind to be a great boon when creating design systems for web-based apps We&#x27;re really hoping Skeleton can bridge the gap and provide the best of both worlds, while saving you the time of recreating these components yourself.
That&#x27;s really the biggest benefit of Skeleton - the tight integration between Svelte and Tailwind CSS. It utilizes Tailwind’s utility classes to customize and extend the look and feel of each component. Then pairs this with Svelte’s awesome component architecture. This allows you to create customized, responsive, and reactive interfaces with surprisingly minimal effort.
Of course, feel free to try it out for yourself. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out. I&#x27;m excited to see what everyone can produce with Skeleton!
Thanks!

          <p>My friend and I love the Notion UI, so we open-source a version we have been building.
- Block-based editor
- Drag to reorder blocks
- Basic Markdown-parsing including bold, italic, headings and divider
- Type &#x27;/&#x27; for command menu and shortcuts
Tiny fun detail: When you move between blocks with your arrow keys, your cursor will remain at roughly the same horizontal position (vs jumping to the start or end of a block).
Lotion is quite limited for now, and we would love any contributions (e.g. image blocks, video blocks, code blocks, etc.)

          <p>This month we launched a waitlist for Luro. For simplicity’s sake on our Eleventy-powered site, we felt like Netlify Forms was a slam dunk for getting the waitlist up and running in a couple minutes by adding a netlify attribute to our waitlist form.


	... form goes here ...



Netlify now intercepts these form requests, stores the results in a waitlist table, and lets us download them as a CSV. Huzzah.
CSVs are great and all, they power the business world, but we wanted to take it one step further and update a Notion database whenever someone uses the form. This gives us a lil’ impromptu CRM for adding metadata and tracking invite statuses internally when those start going out.
Sounds like a job for Zapier?
Yes! You can tota…</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/help-css-nesting/ target="_blank">Help pick a syntax for CSS nesting</a>
          <p>CSS nesting is a convenience syntax addition that allows CSS to be added inside
of a ruleset. If you&#x27;ve used
SCSS,
Less or
Stylus, then
you&#x27;ve most certainly seen a few flavors of this:
.nesting {
  color: hotpink;
  &gt; .is {
    color: rebeccapurple;
    &gt; .awesome {
      color: deeppink;
    }
  }
}
Which after being compiled to regular CSS by the preprocessor, turns into
regular CSS like this:
.nesting {
  color: hotpink;
}
.nesting &gt; .is {
  color: rebeccapurple;
}
.nesting &gt; .is &gt; .awesome {
  color: deeppink;
}
An official CSS version of this syntax is being strongly considered and we have
a split in preference that we&#x27;d like to employ the help of the community to
break the tie. The rest of this post will be introducing the syntax options so
you can feel informed to take a survey at …</p>

          <p>Y’know that situation where you tell the client, “Here’s your website and you can edit those four (4) little homepage features in the CMS” and the client says “Okay okay okay” and you check the site a week later and it looks bad because the client —despite your incredible documentation— put an odd number of items in the feature grid? It’s a major minor problem that’s tough to explain to the client, but it all comes down to…
The dangler.
Odd number grids are a sore point in Responsive Design. Even numbered grids collapse easily from 4 columns → 2 columns → 1 column, but odd numbered grids leave you with one extra column to figure out. You have two choices: drop the odd column to its own row or take the coward’s route and convert 3 columns → 1 column prematurely at ~800px. If you take that r…</p>

          <p>As a java backend developer decided to practice some front end work (Each backend developer dreams to become FrontEnd developer :-D )
I сhoosed Svelte+TailwindCSS to get more familiar with frameworks as I planning to use it on my next project(probably SvelteKit+TailwindCSS and SSR on Firebase function).
But to get started, decided to begin with something simple, pure Svelte+TailwindCSS and Firebase hosting.
And as my morning routine starts with some workout, decided to implement CrossFit timers.
This simple project allow me to understand more deeply:
  - work with components and cross-component communication 
  - work with local storage (custom store), so you can save yours timers to local storage
  - PWA capabilities, you can install it on your device and it can work in offline mode.
  - get familiar with utility classes and configuration of Tailwind
  - deploy it to Firebase hosting
Few words about product&#x27;s features: Four different timers available (Tabata, EMOM, AMRAP, RFT); possibility to save your timer; you can share your timers e.g. between your devices or with your friends or audience(for this purpose, custom URL parser/generator was implemented as Svelte doesn&#x27;t support routing unlike SvelteKit/Sapper); PWA and Offline mode.
Conclusion/Impression: 
It&#x27;s pleasure to work with Svelte, it allows you write well structured code, all concepts are understandable and easy to apply, pre built animations and transition, flexibility
With TailwindCSS you can quickly prototype UI components with any complexity with 99% of cases, otherwise extensions are available.
Firebase allowed me to deploy the app in few clicks and, as it just hosting, free quotes are available.

          <p>Dave Rupert recently published a post expressing his frustration with the urgent case for action on climate change, and lack of co-ordinated policy action by the people in power. While much of the world suffers from extreme high temperures this summer, climate change has become a visible, tangible issue for many of us.
Dave rightly points out that the environmental responsibility has been unfairly hoisted onto the consumer, when in reality this is by the design of governments and large corporations, who have vested interests in maintaining the status quo. Individual lifestyle changes, such as reusable shopping bags, sorting our recycling, or going vegan are never going to make much of a difference when faced with the unstoppable juggernaut of capitalism.

          <p>This is a distinct skill. Something can be dependable without being extraordinary, rare or even a good value. It’s also one of the easiest skills to acquire, and often quite valuable if you stick with it. While sticking with dependable is sort of redundant, it’s also required.</p>

          <p>This summer has been hot. Not the hottest summer I’ve had in Texas but hot enough. More worryingly, it’s another summer in what looks like a trend of increasingly hot summers due to unstoppable climate change. It’s hot enough that the grass is dying in places that don’t have shade. The heat is so exhausting we’re making trips to cooler states in the summer to escape, ironically those trips are on planes, which exacerbates the climate problem.
I’m desperate to figure out a way I can help. I keep researching what ascetic life changes I could make to have the biggest impact. I could go vegan tomorrow if it made a big difference… but… and I hate to be a cynic… but one dude in Texas changing his diet isn’t going to save the Earth. It wouldn’t even move the needle.

          <p>Hey HN,
First time submitter here.
After a FOSS related interaction required me to use Google Forms 9 months, I wondered on why no such FOSS tool existed and decided to build it myself. I aimed the site to be for people like me, so no telemetry and minimal JS was the goal. I know this is rather small and incomplete compared to other projects but I&#x27;ve thought you folk might be interested.
Not sure if it breaks the pure part, but the site also uses Flask.
If you&#x27;re lucky, you might find the app alive at: https://formie.div72.xyz.

Move aside, Pacman; there’s a new pixel in town. The pixel art in this collection is nothing short of masterful. Who knew such beauty could come from these “picture elements” of programmable color. What was once reserved for 8-bit video games like Zelda and Mario Bros has evolved into NFTs worth millions of dollars.
Crypto Punks, beware. These pixels are out of this world! ■

This week is full of awesome CSS stuff that people have dreamt of only some years ago. And we have other articles that I’ve been long waiting for: Great custom maps, a modern end-to-end testing framework and a fast Electron alternative. But first of all, the topic of the week:
People always talk about quality time for work, family, fitness, self-care, or sports… but what about having leisure time that allows you to think about nothing and let your mind pause for a bit?
UI/UX
When we talk about User Experience design we often think about design, a clean UI or similar things. But a lot of the experience has to do with the words and texts chosen for the project and here’s a guide that helps understanding the importance of UX Writing.

          <p>I started as a side project, and after 6 months of development, I feel my baby is ready for some beta users. Coming from an engineering background, I had no experience in marketing. I am not looking for a large number of users, only maybe 100 for testing and feedback purposes.
I started with the idea of managing all contents and tools better (into a single contextual workspace). 
Here is the website for more details: https://www.superusapp.com/

          <p>It looks like Google has rolled out a very anti-user update to Analytics.
We have a report on traffic by URL broken out by query string that we use weekly. Right now that report is unusable, and if I try and query I can only query by page title, not URL and definitely not query string.
Is there a way to revert this update, or tell Google &quot;I know what a URL is, please stop this.&quot;

          <p>✏️ This article was written by Nate Holmes and sponsored by our friends at Widen, an Acquia company
A lot goes into creative work. Sure, there’s the actual time a designer spends designing. But there’s also time spent concepting, aligning with business goals, gaining approval, and so much more. If the output ends up being a single-use design, it means you’re likely not getting as much out of your efforts as you could be.
Using creative work in multiple ways accelerates workflows by giving teams access to approved, high-quality content. 
Finding ways to make your design work available for other teams to use, reuse, and repurpose creates endless opportunities to get more value from your creative investment. Using creative work in multiple ways reduces time spent on overlapping efforts, frees…</p>

          <p>Chrome DevTools is adding support for top layer elements, making it easier for developers to debug their code that makes use of top layer elements.
Note: This is a preview feature available in Chrome Canary from version 105.
This article describes what top layer elements are, how DevTools help to visualize the top layer content to understand and debug DOM structure that contains top layer elements, and how DevTools top layer support is implemented.
# What are the top layer and top layer elements?
What exactly happens internally when you open a  as a modal? 🤔
It is put into a top layer. Top layer content renders on top of all other content. For example, a modal dialog needs to appear on top of all other DOM content, so the browser automatically renders this element in a &#x27;top layer&#x27;…</p>

Emotional detachment helps us remember that we are not our work, and that feedback is useful, not an attack. Commitment permits us to keep going (especially when we’re asked to provide more effort than we planned). It’s easy to confuse the […]</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32153868 target="_blank">Ask HN: How to “compile” HTML+CSS for minimal page size?</a>
          <p>From the perspective of static site generation, is there a tool to compile HTML+CSS in order to minimize download size?
I&#x27;m imagining something which takes the following HTML+CSS:
    
    h1{color:red;}
    h2{color:blue;}
    .custom{display:none;}
    .custom2{display:inline;}
    
    ...
    
Hello
lorem ipsum
dolor sit amet

And transforms it into this:
    
Hello
lorem ipsum
dolor sit amet

However, it should not always inline the css styles, because sometimes that would cause the result to be larger than the original, like this:
    
    h1{color:red;}
    h2{color:blue;}
    .custom{display:none;}
    .custom2{display:inline;background-color:yellow;}
    
    ...
    
Hello
lorem ipsum
dolor sit amet

Here, 
 is shorter than 
, so it should remain unchanged.
I&#x27;m not talking about tools like https://htmlcompressor.com/compressor/ which only remove whitespace, or gzip compression. What I want is something that understands the semantics of HTML+CSS and can intelligently inline iff that reduces the size of the resulting HTML file.

          <p>Bootstrap v5.2.0 is finally stable! We’ve ironed out more bugs, improved more documentation, written new guides and built out new functional environment examples, and so much more!
Keep reading for highlights from both beta and stable releases.
Docs redesign
As previewed in our beta release, the docs have been redesigned! It starts with our new homepage  where we have a more complete representation of Bootstrap’s features and an updated design.


The docs sidebar navigation has been overhauled to have always expanded groups for easier browsing, a brand new DocSearch experience with search history, and new responsive offcanvas drawers for both sidebar and navbar on mobile.




We even updated our version picker in the navbar to cross-link between minor releases!


Updated buttons and inputs…</p>

          <a href=https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2022/07/19/bootstrap-4-6-2/ target="_blank">Bootstrap v4.6.2</a>
          <p>After several months, we’ve finally shipped Bootstrap v4.6.2, one of our last releases for the v4. It’s a bit of a maintenance patch featuring bug fixes, dependency updates, and some docs updates.
Read on for the highlights or head to the v4.6.x docs to see the latest in action.
What’s changed
There are two big highlights in v4.6.2:
First, we’ve added an example to our Collapse plugin docs to show how to use horizontal collapsing. This has long been possible via our JS, but we never had an official class to utilize it.
Second, we’ve replaced the deprecated color-adjust with print-color-adjust in our Sass files as part of the Autoprefixer v10.4.6 issues. This should quiet the issues folks have seen from that dependency change. If you’re using our distribution CSS files, like bootstrap.min.css, you may still see the warning.
Beyond that, we’ve addressed a few other things:
Tweaked the size of small and .small to compute to a whole pixel value (was 12.8px and now is 14px).
Improved accessibility around our dropdowns, color contrast, and role attributes.
Fixed some broken links to supporting documentation.
Updated dependencies across the board.
Review the GitHub v4.6.2 release changelog for more details.
From here, we don’t expect to ship any meaningful updates to v4.6.x other than major security or dependency updates. Everything will focus on v5 and beyond after this release, starting with the stable release of v5.2.0. Bootstrap 4 will officially end of life January 1, 2023, though you’re obviously welcome to continue using it longer than that. Follow our release repo to stay in the loop on release maintenance status.

          <a href=https://css-irl.info/logical-properties-for-useful-shorthands/ target="_blank">Logical Properties for Useful Shorthands</a>
          <p>Something I like about logical properties is the ability to set margins or padding on just a single axis on an element, while leaving the other alone. Say we have an element on which we’ve set some padding using the padding shorthand:
/* This gives us 1rem padding all the way around */
.box {
  padding: 1rem;
}
If, later on, we want to adjust the padding only on the x-axis (while preserving our original value on the y-axis), we have a couple of choices:
We could use padding-left and padding-right. Fine, but longer than our original shorthand.
.box--some-variant {
  padding-right: 2rem;
  padding-left: 2rem;
}
We could use the shorthand, but remembering to include our original values.
.box--some-variant {
  padding: 1rem 2rem;
}
I’m not a huge fan of having to repeat the original value for the y-axis padding. We could abstract those values out into custom properties — something like this:
.box {
  padding: var(--py, 1rem) var(--px, 1rem);
}
.box--some-variant {
  --px: 2rem;
}
On the other hand, there is a logical property that enables us to adjust the padding on a single axis: padding-inline refers to the padding on the x-axis when the document is in the left-to-right (default) or right-to-left writing mode. padding-block refers to the y-axis. (Those directions are reversed for a vertical writing mode.)
So instead we could write:
.box {
  padding: 1rem;
}
.box--some-variant {
  padding-inline: 2rem;
}
Codepen demo →
The same applies to margins, borders and a bunch of others. And check out the inset property for a great positioning shorthand!
Logical properties are very well supported in browsers now, so it’s a good time to start using them.</p>

Over the last few years, the Chrome Web Frameworks and Tools Performance fund has tried to help support this effort through the sponsorship of popular JavaScript frameworks and developer tools. This is in addition to our engineering collaborations on projects like React, Next.js and Angular through Project Aurora.
Today we are happy to share that we will be distributing another $500K through Open Collective to projects focused on improving the performance, user-experience and developer-experience building for the web over the next year. These projects include:

          <p>Hey there, I am Honey - Co-founder at Locofy.
We, along with other makers, have been building Locofy.ai to help massively accelerate the builders - the designers, developers, product managers &amp; founders, and we&#x27;re excited to share it today with the HN Community.
Locofy.ai simply converts designs into production-ready frontend code for web and mobile apps. It adapts to your preferred design tools, tech stack, and workflows with ease and lets you launch upto 4x faster, while letting designers design the way they want and giving high-quality responsive code that developers love.
With this launch, you can convert your Figma designs into React, React Native, Next.js, Gatsby, and HTML-CSS code. You get a live-responsive prototype that runs on code (we call these ‘real-fidelity prototypes’) and when good to go, you can either export the code to build on top of it or directly deploy to Netlify, Vercel, or Github.
Today, we have also launched on Product Hunt. Let us know your thoughts and suggestions: https://www.producthunt.com/posts/locofy-ai.
Our team will be answering all your questions!

Having just graduated from Dribbble’s Certified Product Design Course, Serina joins us today to share her experience and offer advice to budding product designers.
Serina Murphy
      My name is Serina Murphy and I’m currently a UI/UX Designer at Fear Free.



Tell us about your background and experience with design.
After spending a decade of proven success driving revenue in tech advertising (Yahoo!, Miniclip, Disney), I sought out a new career that leverages my creativity and experience in tech. I married two distinct areas of my educational background in occupational therapy (earning a Master’s degree) and UX design (completing a design bootcamp at Avocademy).

          <p>For those working in tech/software development teams - do you also find that there&#x27;s a lot of tension between developers and designers?
They need to work together but it always seems like a challenge. From the tools they prefer (Figma vs. Github) to the pace/workflow to the language and communication.
What are the biggest pain points you&#x27;ve seen?
What are some great tips for bridging the gaps during a typical workflow?
Thanks!

          <p>Hypothetically, consider a social photo platform - each pic gets its own url, this page contains the image, text about the image, buttons for the user to click, related pics, and some user-specific elements (maybe notifications, etc.).
There are different ways of going about the frontend. In each case, elements specific to the logged-in-user and the related images get fetched via api calls and are rendered client side.
For rendering the rest of the page -
1. Everything is rendered client side - one can use a single page application to handle the routing. The page structure stays the same, and new image uri&#x27;s and the associated content are fetched via api calls.
SEO is a priority, so pure client side rendering is suboptimal.
2. Server side rendering for each page with NextJS or even Express…</p>

The common way to do that is to use a global counter variable to increment and log in the function. var i &#x3D; 0; function test(){ // other functionality i++; console.log(i); // other functionality } […]</p>

          <p>I have build many small size web apps.
I lack experience in designing medium to large application. I tried to read system design content but not able to gain confidence.
How can I do the hands-on practice of system design concepts. Please your tips, resources, plan etc.

          <p>I tried to run the old standalone version of SketchUp Make 2017 on my modern M1 Mac running macOS Monterey 12.4 recently. At first it went pretty badly, crashing on startup with the error “SketchUp quit unexpectedly.”

But I got it working!
Here’s how to get it running by removing the code signature.
The main clue came when I tried running it from the Terminal, to see if it
would show a more useful error. I got the same popup error, but also this:
rosetta error: /var/db/blahblah/SketchUp.aot: attachment of code signature supplement failed: 1
zsh: trace trap  /Applications/SketchUp\ 2017/SketchUp.app/Contents/MacOS/SketchUp

“attachment of code signature supplement failed”, eh?
We’ll just remove that code signature, then… from absolutely everything inside the app.
To do this, launch the Ter…</p>

          <p>User preference media features give you the ability to style web experiences that align with the user&#x27;s own specific preferences and needs. In other words, preference media features allow you to adapt your user experiences to your user&#x27;s expectations.


You can enhance the user experience of your website by taking the following three steps:
Discover the possibilities. Learn all the user preference media features.
Style your web experiences. Implement, for example, color, layout, and element size changes based on the preferences.
Test the UI. In DevTools, emulate the preferences and test how your website behaves.
DevTools supports a variety of emulation options. To help you avoid searching for and adjusting system and browser settings, all the emulation options reside in one place—under the Rendering tab in DevTools.
The emulation options of the user&#x27;s preferences include but are not limited to:
prefers-color scheme—light or dark color scheme
prefers-contrast—lower or higher contrast
prefers-reduced-motion—minimize motion or not
prefers-reduced-data—consume less traffic or not
For a comprehensive list of all emulation options, see Emulate CSS media features.
To discover more effects you can apply using the Rendering tab, see the Rendering tab overview.
Additionally, with DevTools, your testing capabilities aren&#x27;t limited to the single device you&#x27;re working on. You can Simulate mobile devices with Device Mode.</p>

          <p>Bootstrap Icons v1.9.0 is here with over 140 new and updated icons, including some longstanding requests for new brands, transportation options, numbers and letters, and so much more. With this release, we’re now at over 1,800 icons!
140+ new icons
Here’s a quick look at all the new icons in v1.9.0:



Tons of new brand icons including popular browsers, Ubuntu, Google Play, Android, Dropbox, and many more.
New transportation icons including cars, trains, planes, fuel, and common road signs.
New number and letter icons for 1-9, R, C, CC, H, and P (for use cases like registered trademark, copyright, Creative Commons, hospital or helicopter, and parking).
New medical icons for prescriptions, pills, and viruses.
New keyboard icons for tab and escape.
New Universal Access cions.
Redrawn cup icon, now with a steam variant for hot beverages.
Fire, finally!
There are a handful more in there as well, so have a look and put them to use in your next update! In addition, we’ve updated our docs to include mention of Composer installs.
Looking for more new icons? Head to the issue tracker to check for open requests or submit a new one.
Install
To get started, install or update via npm:
npm i bootstrap-icons


Or Composer:
composer require twbs/bootstrap-icons


You can also download the release from GitHub, or download just the SVGs and fonts (without the rest of the repository files).
Figma
The Figma file is now published to the Figma Community! It’s the same Bootstrap Icons Figma file you’ve seen from previous releases, just a little more accessible to those using the app.</p>

# Restart frame during debugging
The Restart frame feature is back! You can re-run the preceding code when paused somewhere in a function. Previously, this feature was deprecated and removed in Chrome 92 due to stability issues.
In this example, the debugger initially paused at the breakpoint (line 343) near the end of the toggleColorScheme function. To restart the debugging from the beginning of the toggleColorScheme function, expand the Call stack section in the Debugger pane, right click on toggleColorScheme and select Restart frame.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32022275 target="_blank">Ask HN: How do you design data models for applications?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;m an application architect for a brand new application. The application uses tons of data from multiple external systems. New data tables needed to be created for the application too. The person that designed the application is not technical at all. They only designed the front-end and I designed the data model based off it.
I did the best I could with the information I had and we are slowly starting to see a working prototype, but there are still a lot of unanswered questions that I&#x27;m trying to figure out. The project is behind. I want to take responsibility for it being behind. But at the same time the project seems understaffed and it appears too much is being asked considering the size of the team.
What could I have done differently?

          <p>I&#x27;m looking for resources/tips on how to learn concepts in system design. Things around backend engineering and all the various components that go into building large scale systems (load balancing, message queues, CDNs, etc.). I&#x27;d also like to learn concepts around data like database sharding, non-relational database models, streaming/batch (lambda architecture, kappa architecture, etc.) and more.
In terms of what I&#x27;ve done so far...
I&#x27;ve read
- Designing Data Intensive Applications (https://dataintensive.net/) - This book has been recommended a ton on HN/twitter/reddit and I found it extremely useful to get a better idea of how data systems work, different types (OLAP vs. OLTP, data warehouse vs. lake, etc.) and get a better understanding of distributed systems.
- Quastor (https://www.quastor.org/) - This is a newsletter that sends out summaries of system design blog posts from Big Tech engineering blogs. It&#x27;s been helpful to me for getting an understanding of the different components involved in the tech stacks at various companies and how companies think about building scalable systems.
- MIT Distributed Systems (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list&#x3D;PLrw6a1wE39_tb2fErI4-W...) - This is a series of lectures by Robert Morris (co-founder of YC) on distributed systems and their properties. The lectures pick a specific tool/technology (Google File System, ZooKeeper, Apache Spark, etc.) and then discusses it. I&#x27;ve really enjoyed reading the papers and watching the lectures.
I&#x27;d really love any recommendations from the HN community on how else I should be learning about system design.
Thank you very much!

          <p>Say you&#x27;re building a web SITE (not a web APPLICATION).
This is a site that simply publishes content. There&#x27;s no elaborate functionality or interactivity, other than a few web forms. The use cases is &quot;click a link, view a page, click another link, view another page, etc.&quot;
Can a full JavaScript UI framework like React or Svelte provide value here? Are they worth the trouble over simple server-side templating/rendering of HTML (SSR)? Why or why not?

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;31991675 target="_blank">Ask HN: Is it a strength that HN&#x27;s UI has not changed over many years?</a>
          <p>I find myself lately gravitating back to older communities that survived the social media wave on the Internet because they seem to be a bit better at keeping track and promoting visibility of meaningful conversations, despite traditional functional flaws, screen sizing, and often dreadful large threaded views. I think a major strength is that most of these traditionally designed sites/apps still emphasize chronological order for content and posts, which makes the experience less prone to manipulation and more timely.
It also seems with older sites like HN and online bulletin boards, content can be bookmarked, and it&#x27;s easier to correspond with users on a more regular basis. I think the most frustrating trend on modern sites and apps is that content I want to see simply disappears into a sea of other things I don&#x27;t want to see, and that searching to find that content is futile, as results are often gamified and spammed into oblivion.
I miss IRC now, I miss bulletin boards despite all the flaws, I miss old school web sites that had the same content in the same place even after hitting refresh.
In my opinion, traditionally highly effective, favorable, and functional user-experience-based design has been thrown out the window lately as a trend; apps now are very often geared towards tracking, sponsored post placement, and profit/revenue optimization goals, rather than towards creating favorable user experiences.
It makes me wonder (despite some issues of course) if HN is still one of the best places to communicate and post serious matters BECAUSE it&#x27;s UI/UX hasn&#x27;t changed (In major ways) for many years?

          <p>Olivia Hoskin
      Writer &amp; Design Enthusiast 

Are you looking for a UI as black as your coffee? Look no further. Dark mode, activate.
These low-light UIs are just what the doctor ordered whenever you need to get those creative juices flowing in the extra early or late hours. Use these picks to inspire your next dark mode UI design project or whenever you want to create something sleek. Even Batman would be impressed.
Nothing beats a good ole dark mode, from NFTs to banks to streaming to fitness. But remember, even if you’re not ready for the day, it cannot always be night 😉■

The Dude Ranch and a horse named Tank
June kicked off with a rare family trip. My brother and his family came down from South Dakota and we all drove out to meet my mom and her husband in Bandera, TX for two days at Mayan Dude Ranch. Because we live all over the US, we haven’t done a trip with my mom and all the grandkids, and I’m glad we pulled it together.
One of the main attractions of the dude ranch is the cowboy’ing. Lasso classes, hatchet throwing, and trail rides everyday. You can even ride a horse to a chuck wagon breakfast. This was my kids’ first horse ride experience and they both did great. Each horse had a fun name like “Whiskey” or “Pepsi” which kids love to talk about ad nauseum. Of course, being a cool…</p>

          <p>I spoke about CSS layout at CSS Day conference recently, and in the Q&amp;A session afterwards I was asked about masonry layout in CSS. Masonry layout, in case you’re not aware, is where different height items are laid out in columns but, rather than being aligned on the row axis, the items below effectively move up to plug any gaps, kind of like a bricklayer — hence the name. Pinterest’s grid design is a commonly-cited example whenever the masonry conversation comes up.
The current state of masonry in CSS
Currently we can build a kind of faux-masonry (or “fakesonry”, if you will) layout in CSS by using columns.
.list {
  columns: 20rem;
  column-gap: 1rem;
}

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;31971019 target="_blank">Ask HN: Which social media app has the best design in your opinion?</a>
          <p>Which social media app do you think has the best design? This can include UX or UI design. Apparently most people don&#x27;t pay attention to fonts, symbols and other stuff closely, but for those of us that do, which app speaks to you the most? This can really be any app, but preferably one of the more known social media apps.
For me, I&#x27;ve used Twitter probably the most by far, so I might be biased. They have a great black dark mode. The font is genuinely so cool. The high contrast labels and icons are so pleasing to look at.  The profile pages are cool and overall, the app layout makes the most sense to me in terms of the replies and features. Apparently Twitter is one of the more confusing apps to use, but Reddit is insanely confusing to me. When you look at social media and the internet overall, Twitter and Bootstrap seem to have had the biggest influence on app and website design, so many apps have similar features that Twitter does.
My least favorite is probably Reddit and Snapchat. Snapchat is pretty smooth to use, but the colors and bubble-like design just doesn&#x27;t do it for me, and the profiles and searching thing is very confusing. Reddit is just a horrifically slow app and replies to posts are insanely annoying to sift through. I find myself closing every first tier replies so I can read replies instead if replies to replies. It&#x27;s a confusing mess and there&#x27;s just about nothing on the app that makes sense to me, which is interesting considering Quora, Twitter and Reddit are essentially the same thing and apparently had some of the same people on their design teams.
There&#x27;s plenty of more stuff I like about Twitter, but the main thing is that fact that I prefer Twitter&#x27;s design in general over other apps.
What about you?

          <p>I wanted to know what documentation tools are people using to write software design docs. I have mostly seen that people use whichever general purpose Docs application is being used in their organization to write software docs too (Google Docs, Notion, etc).
If there was to exist a documentation software especially for software design documents, what features would be the most important? Are there any tools which do this well?
Also, as a software engineer, have you ever felt that the documentation software you use is lacking and does not help you communicate your ideas well, due to lack of native support for content like diagrams, schemas, state machines, etc.
