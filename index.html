          <p>Im back on an intentional job search and unfortunately started going back on linkedin just to get a wider exposure to job postings. 
Am somewhat surprised by this but linkedin website on mobile (not the app) does not seem to have any way to log out from the account. I looked for a couple minutes and couldn’t find anything so it’s possible I missed it - but nothing is obvious.
Additionally, the expected place one would look for such a “feature” is the top right of the page - and that’s where the mobile site puts the link to messages. So it seems to be kind of an intentional loop into getting Users to view messages rather than leaving.
Am somewhat dumbfounded by this but certainly seems like a dark pattern. Phuck you linkedin for this kind of stuff. I’ve always hated this platform and know others share similar feelings (and know there are advocates for it - fair enough).
My browser is set to not store cookies/cache anyway so after closing the mobile browser I was logged out. But good riddance.

          <p>Hello Hacker News community,
I wanted to share with you a tool I created called MonitUp that has helped me improve my productivity by tracking my computer activities and providing weekly recommendations based on the data.
MonitUp tracks which apps and websites I use during the day, and based on that data, it offers recommendations on how I can better manage my time and be more productive. For example, it has suggested that I create a schedule for myself that includes time for work, rest, and leisure activities, and to prioritize my tasks so that I&#x27;m focusing on the most important ones first.
I created MonitUp because I was struggling with productivity and wanted a way to track my time and get recommendations on how to improve. It has been incredibly helpful for me, and I wanted to share it with the Hacker News community.
I&#x27;m not here to advertise my product, but rather to share my experience and offer a recommendation for anyone who is looking for a tool to help them improve their productivity. If you&#x27;re interested in trying MonitUp out, feel free to visit our website at https://timetracking.monitup.com/ and sign up for a free trial.
I&#x27;m also here to ask for feedback from the community. What do you think about MonitUp? What other features would you like to see? How can I improve the tool to better serve our users?
Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.
Best,
Faruk Durak

The “summary” element for showing/hiding details springs to mind. What else is there?

          <p>This is an interface on top of the OpenAI API for GPT-3 and 4. It looks similar to ChatGPT, but has a few more features.
It does require you to have an API key for the GPT API. The API key is stored in your browser local storage , but a hash of it is used to make sure your history is unique to you. The hash is stored in the backend.
There are two main reasons why I created this for myself, you also might find it useful:
- I would really wanted ChatGPT to have access get contents from websites
- I don&#x27;t like subscription fees and I don&#x27;t like how slow the free ChatGPT is, I like to pay-as-I-go, and GPT API already allows me to do that
P.S. There&#x27;s also a Chrome extension for summarising pages, but it&#x27;s my first time creating a Chrome extension. It&#x27;s ugly and buggy, and the slow review process of the Chrome web app developer  console doesn&#x27;t help.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35649336 target="_blank">Ask HN: What is the state of the art for visual React design?</a>
          <p>Im unfamiliar with the visual UI design scene. 
What I’m looking for is the fastest way to prototype UIs for single page web apps. 
Right now I manually write them. I’m wondering if there is a visual design tool that exports human readable react code that you can then wire up with hooks etc. 
Thanks for the answers!

          <p>I even bought that course by that popular guy. CSS for JS developers that  could not help me because I could not help myself. CSS designs is just not for me no matter how hard I try.
I find web development to be mostly css(frontend) and if you lack css skills, you can&#x27;t be a good web developer.
failwindcss and bootcrap are no substitute for cs s according to the experts of industry.
How do I learn it? Is there a way out?

          <p>Doing a ton of classless CSS right now and plain vim is slowing me down little due to lack of WYSIWYG, which normally doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.
Is there a tool that lets me see my CSS in one pane and the rendered HTML file in another, such that if I tweak the CSS I can see the rendered changes live in the HTML? Bonus if Markdown is supported.

Let’s start fresh and move backwards. It’s been a rough couple weeks.
Thu: A woman with road rage threatened to shoot me in front of my kids on the way home from school.
Fri: Kids out of school
Sat: My dog died
Tue: Daughter came home from school with pink eye
Tue: Baseball game going to 10pm on a school night
Wed: Baseball game going to 10pm on a school night
Thu: Wife went to the ER at 8pm and got her appendix removed at 2am

          <p>A lot of otherwise talented people are too pessimistic to actually do anything. They are paralyzed by risks that don’t exist and greatly exaggerate them where they do, preventing them from being one of the best. Consider this lightly edited excerpt from a conversation between Charlie Rose and Magnus Carlsen that argues it’s better to …

          <p>Another day, another joycon (actually, these are pretty satisfying because people tend to want these to work).
I was expecting another mashed in shoulder button, but instead when I opened this joycon, I found the shoulder button entirely missing. Goodness knows where it went (it wasn&#x27;t inside the shell).
Replacing the button was straightforward, but annoyingly the placement was marginally off (by about 1.5mm) - which meant I needed to sand down the plastic of the trigger to allow for enough travel.</p>

          <p>I love these little cartridge based handhelds (apparently the smallest released). I&#x27;ve got a few that I&#x27;m working on repairing because they fail pretty hard when corrosion gets in there.
However, in this particular case, though it was sold as &quot;junk&quot;, only the left button on the dpad was failing. A good scrub with IPA and it was back working. Hugely simple compared to the ones with corrosion!</p>

          <p>I&#x27;ve been making some art content and articles using various AI tools since last summer but I never know what preamble to put on the stuff and so I just say something like generated with whatever.
Does anybody know if there&#x27;s a font awesome icon or HTML tags or legal guidance from creative commons that can be used as a canonical placeholder for publishing art or generated code or articles using AI. I could find stuff like this:

But nothing suggesting a style handling disclosure of the AI generation, a tag, an icon, legal marking or anything authoritative that targets both human and computer consumption (crawling, etc.). I&#x27;d prefer something easy-to-copy in text or HTML or the like.
Any ideas?

          <p>An excellent discussion on the explosion, or even, implosion, of AI and how it&#x27;s being tested and developed in public when the implications seem to have been swept aside in favour of the arms race between the big corps.
Policies and law haven&#x27;t been written and it&#x27;s the experts that don&#x27;t even have the confidence you&#x27;d hope to hear about:

50% of A.I. researchers believe there&#x27;s a 10% or greater chance that humans go extinct from our inability to control AI

Tristan Harris and Aza Raskin discuss the risk to society and how safety measures are far from adequate and laws need to be implemented.

When you invent a new technology, you uncover a new class of responsibilities

It&#x27;s a long watch at a little over an hour, but strongly recommend as we plough head long into a future where AI is inter-tangled with society.

          <p>Olivia Hoskin
      Writer &amp; Design Enthusiast 

As designers and teams, we all know the importance of having a solid brand identity consistently communicated across all touchpoints. But creating effective brand guidelines that are easy to follow (and maintain) can take time, and traditional methods, such as creating a PDF document, can be outdated and difficult to work with.
In this blog post, we’ll dive into the key elements that make the most successful brand guidelines and provide tips to create better ones. If you’re ready to upgrade your brand guidelines and creation process, let’s get started!
Thanks to our friends at Brandpad for sponsoring this blog post!

          <p># The birth of test automation
Let&#x27;s rewind back to the 1990s when the web browser was born. Test automation didn&#x27;t become a reality until the 2000s, with the emergence of Selenium and WebDriver projects to tackle cross-browser and multi-device testing challenges.
These two projects joined forces in 2011 as Selenium WebDriver and became a W3C standard in 2018. We usually refer to it as WebDriver or WebDriver “Classic”.
The evolution of the Selenium WebDriver project

Test automation prior to WebDriver “Classic” was quite tricky. Being able to automate browser testing significantly improved the quality of developers’ and testers’ lives.
# The rise of JavaScript
As web development evolved to rely more on JavaScript, new automation solutions such as WebdriverIO, Appium, Nightwatch, Protractor…</p>

          <p>I’m looking for screencasts on things like someone going about getting a problem and going through the whole process of a creating a solution. OO design, problem solving, coding it, testing it etc. Does such a thing exist? Sort of like Practical OO Design in Ruby in screencast form? Or even pairing sessions on a problem? More focussed on the thought process of the developer rather than learning a specific language or tool. Seems like there should be, but maybe I’m not looking in the right place!

          <p>Limited resources for research can cause missed opportunities and suboptimal solutions in product design.
AI can help designers overcome limited resources for research by providing quick and efficient access to data and insights.
Recognizing the potential to harness the vast knowledge available on the internet, I identified an opportunity in leveraging Language Models (LLMs) to create QoQo.
https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1189158575928509194/Q...
What can QoQo do?
QoQo offers a range of features to facilitate various aspects of design, including:
- User persona generation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;rujy8TKrfYU&amp;t&#x3D;2s)
- User journey mapping (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;2hBxT2ENaE8&amp;t&#x3D;4s)
- UX copywriting (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;YEvnu7YQMM0&amp;t&#x3D;12s)
- User interview question suggestions (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;JDJQ4ZRPkK8&amp;t&#x3D;8s)

          <p>What’s the current state and future of work-from-anywhere, productivity devices for someone with poor vision?
I’m not talking about answering emails at the coffee shop with a laptop. I’m talking about hanging off a glacier in the sun, writing code.
And by poor vision, I mean, corrected, I can just about read a newspaper in poor lighting. I can’t see your laptop over your shoulder. You’ll need to jack up the font size, thanks. I’ve never understood shiny screens, it’s like a mirror to me.
I’m not worried about power supply, yet. The current state of batteries should be fine.
Also connectivity is not a problem, yet. I’ll tether my phone, or use some satellite service.
I appreciate that this is idealistic but bear with me. My dream life scenario is that I’m on some physical adventure/expedition, and suddenly we need some code to save our lives. (Anyone do this?)
So I need terminals, IDE’s, connectivity, text and voice based communication, GPT. All the good stuff. I don’t need high resolution or photo/video editing, yet.
Less ambitiously and more realistically, I’d like to work in my back garden when the sun is out.
I’ve always been on the fence about keyboards. I don’t like the rigid posture required but I have adapted to become an efficient user of this tool. And fixing the keyboard to the tiny screen (classic laptop) makes it worse. I’ve always thought we can do better.
Am I just looking for a rugged E-ink tablet?
I should also add, I’m super optimistic and re-energised about where the tech is headed with E-ink for displays and GPT for productivity. The opportunities feel liberating.
Thanks

          <p>It’s been a while since my last article on here (well, a month is a while for me, anyway 😅), as I’ve been busy with my head down preparing for my talk on modern CSS layout at Beyond Tellerand, which is (checks notes) tomorrow!
Although I haven’t had much time for blogging, it has given me a chance to delve once again into messaging about with CSS layout and the :has() pseudo-class, or “parent selector”. I’ve already written about :has() in a previous post, and you can read an in-depth guide by Jen Simmons on the Webkit blog. But to recap, :has() allows us to select a parent or sibling of an element by taking a relative selector list as its argument (to paraphrase MDN).

          <p>That’s unlikely. You’re rarely going to get the freedom and resources to do your best work unfettered. The hard part (and the opportunity) is to figure out how to get comfortable with fettered. Because fettered is what’s on offer. Boundaries and scarcity aren’t simply impediments. They’re leverage points and opportunities.</p>

Previous episodes
Using layer based animations in Views can improve performance and reduce jankiness, but they’re rather difficult to set up. The AnimationBuilder classes can vastly reduce complexity and improve readability for layer animations.
Suppose you needed to animate a continuous cross-fade between the following two views, such as in the following image.
Here is an example of how this could be done using the layer animation APIs directly.
auto primary_title_sequence &#x3D; std::make_unique();
auto working_sequence &#x3D; std::make_unique();

Today, we are announcing a new Developer Enrollment process for Privacy Sandbox relevance and measurement APIs, across Chrome and Android. This will replace the current Privacy Sandbox Android enrollment process.
The enrollment process will verify the entities calling the APIs, and gather data needed to properly configure and use these APIs.
Current enrollment for Android APIs will be migrated to this new process. Testers who want to use the Android APIs should continue to sign up through the existing process until the new …</p>

like an ordinary site–maybe except for the colorful background. It&#x27;s anything

          <p>The CSS Working Group is working on a solution to the situation where a layout method can arrange items in an order that is disconnected from the source, and therefore from the reading and focus order of the document. This article explains the problem and proposed solution, and we would love your feedback.
# The problem
The reading order of an HTML document follows the source order. This means that a screen reader will read the document as it is laid out in the source, and a person using the keyboard to tab around the document will also follow that source order. Usually this makes sense, and a sensible source order for the document is vital for reading mode presentations of content, screen readers, and any device with limited CSS. However, CSS, and flexbox and grid in particular, can creat…</p>

          <p>I bought a joblot of Pebble watches a while back (only to secure a Pebble Round to gift to my mum), but it also included a Pebble Steel. Though the watched happily charged and turned on, when I unplugged the charging port, the watch immediately died.
When I got around to opening the watch (using the same screw bit for the classic) the lipo battery inside had … popped, I guess. It was bad.
Thankfully I found a few replacements on Ebay (as the batteries are particularly small) and with some careful soldering (to some very small solder point) and squeezing of wires to fit into such a tiny space, the Pebble Steel lives again. That&#x27;s 3 Pebbles I&#x27;ve revived in recent months - I&#x27;ve just got one Pebble Classic left to fix!</p>

# Override network response headers
You can now override response headers in the Network panel. Previously, you needed access to the web server to experiment with HTTP response headers.
With response header overrides, you can locally prototype fixes for various headers, including but not limited to:
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Headers
Permissions-Policy Headers
Cross-Origin Isolation Headers
To override a header, navigate to Network &gt; Headers &gt; Response Headers, hover over a header&#x27;s value, click  and edit it.
You can also add custom headers.

          <a href=https://gistreader.com/ target="_blank">Show HN: GistReader – an RSS reader that uses AI to summarise your content</a>
          <p>Hi everyone!
Aron (@arondeparon) here, founder of Gistreader.com.
I was an avid user of Google Reader back in the day, but for some reason, I silently rolled over when they decided to kill it and never looked at RSS again.
Lately, I am getting more and more frustrated by the fact that most of the content that I consume is being pushed at me by some kind of algorithm. I wanted more control over this process, so decided to build GistReader.
In its basic form, GistReader is an RSS reader that aims to make your reading experience as fast and pleasant as possible. In addition to that, it uses AI to automatically create summaries of your articles and uses text-to-speech to optionally read a condensed version of an article to you out loud.
GistReader is my first-ever product launch, so as you might expect, I&#x27;m pretty nervous about that, especially when it comes to sharing it on HN :)
Please, feel free to let me know what you think. It&#x27;s all very early-days (lots of things I want to fix/improve/build) and the only way I can improve is by getting solid feedback from people that might actually use it.
Thanks!

          <p>My son spotted that a column (albeit a zigzag) of LEDs wasn&#x27;t lighting up on these funky pair of shades that react to sound.
As you might have seen on Christmas lights, if one LED goes out, the entire line goes out - which was the case here.
The test process to isolate the right LED was to put the multimeter into diode mode (or continuity mode also works) and put the positive lead to the positive leg and negative to the negative leg - which causes it to light up.
Working my way through the row of LEDs I found that one wasn&#x27;t lighting up, I resoldered it (in the hope that it was just a bd connection rather than a duff LED) and hey-ho-what-do-you-know, it worked again 😎</p>

          <p>Your kennel name was Lyla. Your previous owner called you Kate. We called you Rudy, Rudo, Rudo Prosciutto, Dodo, Dody, Rude dog, Rudiosis, Rudiosis Montosis, Rudy girl, Girly, and Sweet girl. Didn’t matter what we called you, you came. You were the sweetest dog we could have ever imagined.

Your first owner loved you and trained you but was busy with work and felt guilty about kenneling you so much, so she returned you to the shelter. The next day, you came into our lives.

          <p>This Pebble started off with an intermittent fault that would gradually get worse - the screen would start to distort.
I had originally planned on removing the battery from this Pebble and transplanting to another Pebble Classic I had which couldn&#x27;t hold charge, but on doing some digging came across a wonderful post (bless blogging!) that explained that this was a common problem and related to (probably) a loose (or not great) connection.
The solution: open the Pebble with a torx bit and insert a small slice of sponge behind the display and now it&#x27;s running good and no screen garbage.</p>

          <p>Anyone know if Spotify measures UI usage?  I find the new UI unusable for browsing.
I&#x27;d like to think they&#x27;re distinguishing between the various forms of usage like search, home screen, library (I know I would).    I&#x27;m tempted to forego the app entirely.  But my wife didn&#x27;t get the update and my playlists are still usable.
PS, If anyone here worked on the new UI; how about giving us guinea pigs an opt out option?

          <p>The Chrome team is thrilled to announce that WebGPU is now available by default in Chrome 113, which is currently in the Beta channel. WebGPU is a new web graphics API that offers significant benefits such as greatly reduced JavaScript workload for the same graphics and more than three times improvements in machine learning model inferences. This is possible due to more flexible GPU programming and access to advanced capabilities that WebGL does not provide.
This initial release of WebGPU is available on ChromeOS, macOS, and Windows. Support for other platforms is coming later this year.

You can download the latest on Google.com for desktop or on Google Play Store on Android.

Web components are great. They’re versatile. They can be rendered on the server or (very much less preferably) on the client. They may or may not need interactivity or client-side JavaScript. And unlike heftier legacy frameworks like React, when you need to add interactivity they can still be extremely lightweight by leveraging (dare I say it…) The Platform™ *audible gasp*.
But let’s not get distracted from the task at hand: we want to evaluate a few different options on the table to apply styles (CSS) to our web components.
Here are the things we want to think about:
Encapsulation. We don’t want styles from distinct components to interfere with each other (that’s what this blog post is here for, after all).
Performance. Predictably, a method popula…</p>

          <p>Hi, I&#x27;ve been playing around with doc2.site which uses Google Docs to create web pages. I tried several Chat GPT plugins to enhance my doc content with semantics like headings, emphasised text etc.
The problem is I always get plain text responses from Chat GPT (and plugins) even if you ask for the HTML output and then if you copy paste the output into Google Docs, you get the HTML tags like 
blah
.I found a script that does copy the output as HTML:
&quot;const blob &#x3D; new Blob([html], {type: &#x27;text/html&#x27;});&quot; so it&#x27;s super easy actually but I couldn&#x27;t find a plugin that handles it nicely like a copy paste response as HTML button.

          <p>Here’s a quick video of me showing you the benefits of GitHub Copilot for docs: AI powered chat interfaces are a great and fun way to learn about new technologies. The problem is quality and relevance. Chat GPT for example doesn’t tell you the source of the information. Bing chat does at times pull from […]</p>

          <p>If you are a developer who wants to concentrate on delivering a killer application rather than worrying about countless security issues, threat model documents can help you do that.

          <p>Picked up from Ebay for £12.50, the fault was &quot;Console turns on but doesn&#x27;t load ds games, and touch screen doesn&#x27;t seem to work,&quot;.
Makes me a bit sad, but this fix was literally clean the DS cart port with IPA, and run a DS cart in and out. There was also some gunk inside the device, which again, just needed cleaning.
The touch screen, after testing, was fine too. Maybe it was the ribbon that needed re-seating, and I did completely take the DS Lite apart and re-shell it (originally it was red with a LOT of stickers) - I feel like the re-shell has a bit of a Star Wars dark side vibe!</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/faster-chrome-releases/ target="_blank">Faster Chrome releases</a>
          <p>Starting with Chrome 114, the Chrome team is reducing the time between the branch for a release, and the actual release to stable. The aim is to shorten the time it takes to launch, and reduce merges.
This will not change the release date for Chrome stable or early stable. It will, however, align the beta release date across platforms. Before Chrome 114, the iOS release went to beta a week before the Desktop and Android releases.
The following table shows how this change affects the 114 release.
Stage
      Chrome 114 (Old)
      Chrome 114 (Revised)
    
Feature Freeze
      Thu, Apr 6
      Tue, Apr 11
    
Branch 
      Thu, Apr 20
      Tue, Apr 25
    
Beta Promotion
      Thu, May 4
      Wed, May 3
    
Beta Promotion (iOS)
      Wed, Apr 26
      Wed, May 3
    
Stable Cut
      Tue, May 23
      Tue, May 23
    
Stable Cut (iOS)
      Tue, May 16
      Tue, May 23
    
Early Stable Release
      Wed, May 24
      Wed, May 24
    
Stable Release
      Tue, May 30
      Tue, May 30
    
Note that Chrome 115 stable will be delayed for two weeks to accommodate the July release freeze, all dates after this have been adjusted to account for the two week delay.
You can keep track of upcoming releases on the Chrome Status Roadmap, and see the schedule in detail on the Chromium Dashboard. We publish a post on this site for each beta release, so you can keep track of upcoming changes to Chrome.

          <p>After Google reader went away, I used netvibes for quite a while which works great on a web browser (although the mobile view is unusable). However, it seems the new owner has lost interest - more and more bugs keep showing up and there is no way to contact support. So I&#x27;m looking for a new reader. It would be great if it had a fast, minimalist web interface, mobile support, generous free tier (long enough for me to decide whether I like the service or not) and customer support.

CSS now supports nesting rules.
The algorithm to set the initial focus on  elements was updated.
No-op fetch() handlers on service workers are skipped from now on to make navigations faster.
And there’s plenty more.
I’m Adriana Jara. Let’s dive in and see what’s new for developers in Chrome 111.
# CSS support for nesting.
One of our favorite CSS preprocessor features is now built into the language: nesting style rules.
Before nesting, every selector needed to be explicitly declared, separately from
one another. This leads to repetition, stylesheet bulk, and a scattered authoring
experience.
.nesting {
  color: hotpink;
}
.nesting &gt; .is {
  color: rebeccapurple;
}
.nesting &gt; .is &gt; .awesome {
  color: deeppink;
}
After nesting, selectors can be

          <p>Does anyone use an alternative GitHub UI? I was thinking of making my own with nothing much more than plaintext and links. My main problem with the default UI is it has too much friction for something I use so often, and the page that loads when I type github.com (the dashboard) is an unnecessary distraction.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35429834 target="_blank">Ask HN: Best design for an Alexa-like voice powered ChatGPT</a>
          <p>I&#x27;m obsessed with OpenAI and ChatGPT and I want to work on a voice powered version so that I can just chat with it directly.
I find the streaming text based response distracting and honestly I&#x27;d just like to talk to it as if it were a partner/collaborator.
My thinking is to use OpenAI Whisper as the Speech to Text (STT) input:
https://openai.com/research/whisper
Then stream the results to a Text To Speech (TTS).
I&#x27;m going to use the raw OpenAI chat API to access GPT directly.
I&#x27;m going to OSS it and put it up on Github.
The problem I&#x27;m having now is that I need a way to stream the output of ChatGPT to the the TTS system.
I think I need something BETTER than the Google Cloud Speech API so I&#x27;m looking for a recommendation.
My idea is to buffer the output from GPT until I have 1-2 sentences, THEN start streaming that, on sentence boundaries, to the TTS system.
That should enable both low latency responses but also give the TTS system a decent chance of making the results sound like an actual human without any jarring breaks (at least I hope)
The problem is that the Google Cloud Speech API doesn&#x27;t have a streaming API.
Though I guess if I only send 2-3 sentences at a time that I can aggregate these in the client and keep the latency small.
Thoughts?

          <p>I wrote a book about absolute nothingness, or at least alluded to its omnipresence, and uploaded it to a fun, somewhat formatted static site for free.
I think when I wrote it I wanted someone to discuss it with, but I’ve since realised it’s a very boring topic to many, and still most get offended by the mere challenging of their beliefs.
It’s not to say I am certain what this book says is correct, but that I would love to understand another’s point of view of… well, nothing at all.
I’ve been a little too obsessed with this concept for a few years now, and don’t regret writing the book, but can’t help but think I could have had a few more discussion if I wrote about, literally, anything else (that isn’t nothing)

          <p>Hot on the heels of our second alpha, we’re releasing a third (and unexpected) alpha for v5.3.0 today with some fixes for some Node Sass compilation errors. In addition, we’ve added a handful of other updates. We’re still on target to ship our stable release soon!
Once again, if you’re new to the v5.3.0 alpha releases, please read through the Migration guide for the first alpha and last month’s second alpha.
Here’s a look at what’s changed in this quick release:
Fixed wrong interpolated variables with node-sass/Hugo.
Added a check for interpolated variables to catch compilation errors with Node Sass when using Sass variables in calc() functions.
Started using --bs-border-radius variables across more components.
Added .d-inline-grid utility class.
Fixed .tooltip-inner placement when using variations in fallbackPlacements.
Fix selectors for dark mode carousel overrides when compiling with $color-mode-type: media-query.
Updated the styling of floating labels when “floated” to include a background-color to help with multiple lines of text in textareas. This also fixes the colors when form elements are disabled in floating forms.
Updated RFS to v10.0.0.
Get the release
Head to https://getbootstrap.com for the latest. It’s also been pushed to npm:
npm i bootstrap@v5.3.0-alpha3

Other people’s habits, though, show that they are simply picky, weird or too sensitive. The difference between a preference and a foible seems to be mostly where we’re standing.</p>

          <p>We made ParallelGPT - a tool that lets you bulk process chatGPT on a spreadsheet UI instead of one-by-one conversation style. Hopefully this saves you time and hassle - especially if you want to build an operational process around it and want to collaborate your team.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35386850 target="_blank">Ask HN: How to address the anti-pattern of inferring design rules from mockups?</a>
          <p>At work, we recently discussed the issues arising from UX/UI designers using visual tools like Figma or Sketch to create mockups that front-end developers have to manually reverse-engineer into HTML/CSS. While these tools provide useful means of visual expression, they often lead to developers having to infer design vocabulary from the mockups themselves, causing a loss of value and potential misinterpretations.
As a community, how can we bridge the gap between visual and text-based web design to preserve design reasoning and intent? Are there better ways to communicate design requirements without relying solely on visual mockups? How can we emphasize the importance of a clear connection between description and visual presentation in modern web design tools to avoid costly mistakes and improve accessibility?

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/devtools-tips-23/ target="_blank">DevTools Tips: What are source maps?</a>
          <p>Source maps let you keep your code readable and debuggable even after you&#x27;ve combined and minified it, without impacting performance.
  
  

When using various transpilers, minifiers, and bundlers, the code you deploy differs from the code you author. To improve network performance, these tools compress the code into a single line, remove unnecessary characters, and shorten variables.
Many tools can generate source maps to accompany your code.
Chrome DevTools reads both the deployed code and source maps and lets you debug your code as you normally would, even with breakpoints.
To better understand how source maps work, check out the source maps visualizer.
Additionally, source maps can have extensions. If you build tools and frameworks, consider supporting them. Check out this Case Study: Better Angular Debugging with DevTools, where the DevTools Team and Angular improved the debugging experience in DevTools by supporting the x_google_ignoreList extension.

          <p>Hi HN, we’re building Noya (https://noya.io), a product design tool that lets everyone design like a designer. Here’s a video: https://player.vimeo.com/video/797476910.
Getting from a product idea to a design is too hard. Wireframing tools (e.g. Balsamiq) are limited and their output is too low-fidelity to get people excited about the idea. On the other hand, high-fidelity design tools (e.g. Figma) require advanced skills and are better for tweaking fine details than hashing out a big picture. Meanwhile, companies have an insatiable need to make new screens and change existing ones, and hiring more designers is time-consuming and expensive.
David and I were on the design tools team at Airbnb when we realized there’s another solution: let designers encode their knowledge (e.g. design rules …</p>

          <a href=https://codeprompt.xyz/ target="_blank">Show HN: CodePrompt – a UI for loading code repos into GPT prompts</a>
          <p>Hi HN, I&#x27;m Chun Rapeepat.
Last week I started playing with GPT-4 and tried different ways to use it to optimize my dev workflow. It was fun, and I was just blown away by what GPT-4 can do.
The idea of CodePrompt first came to mind when I read &quot;Show HN: GPT Repo Loader – load entire code repos into GPT prompts&quot; [1]. It was precisely what I wanted to do! So I tried it.
The GPT Repo Loader works pretty well on a small codebase; However, due to its limitations in loading all files and content into the prompt, I still ran into token context limit issues and needed to copy/edit the code myself.
That&#x27;s when I started working on CodePrompt. Instead of loading the entire repo, why not just load only relevant files or portions of code (or function headers?) that need for the requirement?
How I designed the user journey of CodePrompt.xyz:
1. Choose a GPT model.
2. Select a repo that you want to work with.
3. Pick the relevant files that you want to include in the prompt.
4. Add specific instructions and remove irrelevant codes as needed.
5. Copy the prompt to your chosen GPT model to generate the desired output. Chat &amp; Iterate.
6. If you want to do something else, just go to (3) again.
This allows me to easily generate prompts to do something like 
- Implement features that evolve edits on multiple files
- Create new components while reusing existing codebase
- Generate code with the same style as other files, etc.
I would love to hear all your feedback and ideas on how I can improve it. Or if you want to chat, feel free to ping me on my Twitter @chunrapeepat.
P.S. The project is 100% open-source and free to use.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35350969 target="_blank">Ask HN: What are some tools/techniques that greatly increased your productivity?</a>
          <p>I ask this because so often I see people recommending tools and techniques by saying things like &quot;this dramatically increased my productivity!&quot; or &quot;this sped up my workflow by an order of magnitude!&quot;
How can we take such claims seriously? Most things do not improve our productivity THAT much. However, some things truly do.
Let me give some examples of things I think truly have &quot;dramatically improved&quot; my productivity.
  - testing, specifically integration tests
  - memory safety (garbage collection, borrow checker, etc.)
  - version control (git, etc.)
  - closures and lambdas
  - unix pipes and the idea of composing larger programs out of smaller ones
  - Chrome debugger when working with javascript
    - I hesitate to say &quot;debuggers&quot; in general because I actually think GDB didn&#x27;t &quot;dramatically&quot; improve my productivity back when I programmed in C. And I don&#x27;t even use a debugger at all when I program in python. But the Chrome debugger has numerous features I use all the time.

  - static type systems
    - could be a small win but I don&#x27;t find myself &quot;dramatically more productive&quot;
  - TDD
  - IDEs
    - some IDEs are better than others, but I have yet to experience a dramatic increase in productivity simply by using a new IDE. Text editor + terminal is pretty strong tbh.
  - serverless architecture
    - I could see the argument for scaling concerns, but at a smaller scale I don&#x27;t see a productivity boost compared to a monolith Rails/Django app
  - classes and class-style OOP, inheritance
    - I haven&#x27;t written a class in a long time, and I haven&#x27;t used inheritance in a REALLY long time. I just don&#x27;t think these are huge wins in most cases. Note that I&#x27;m not even advocating for FP here. I program in a procedural style most of the time in all honesty.

Thanks! I look forward to seeing the replies.

          <p>Hi everyone!
I&#x27;ve been really frustrated with the way Notion.so exports your data.
I felt like I was locked into their environment, because the exported files don&#x27;t resemble the original Notion pages very well.
This HN post really motivated me to take matters into my own hands: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35316679
I built notionSnapshot - a HTML export tool for Notion that looks just like the original pages (it&#x27;s actually a fork of loconotion if you already know that project).
Anyway - it took me longer than expected to build and I would really appreciate your feedback.

          <p>Two joycons for the Switch and though the thumbstick worked fine, none of the buttons worked.
I had assumed it was a loose connection, but it turns out that the shoulder buttons - L and R - had been crushed (from heavy usage), which looked to have caused a short which knocked out all the buttons.
It was simple to test by removing the crushed buttons from the PCB and the rest of the buttons came back to life (during the test).
The right joycon is trickier because the shoulder button is directly soldered to the PCB and it being crushed meant that the pads had all been ripped, but I managed to expose the super tiny traces and solder to those. But in future, there&#x27;s easier contact points to jump to.
Otherwise, now all the buttons work, and TIL: mash the shoulder buttons can equate to a totalled joycon!</p>

Also allows mixing in new code blocks one by one, so you can have a REPL-like conversation and add/overwrite JavaScript functions one by one.
Screenshots and install instructions in the GitHub readme.
Taking suggestions for any other kinds of structured output to render, too!

          <p>Our co-worker thought we were heartless monsters. This is a slight exaggeration, but an important lesson about what gets lost in translation when apps aren’t entirely accessible. During an experimental Zoom call, we learned that screen readers and the reactions feature aren’t quite compatible. That means that every time during a call when someone mentioned […]</p>

          <p>I am interested in knowing how a bidding system works from a system design perspective.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find a detail design for this.  There are a couple of challenges that I can think of:
- many bidders for a specific item requiring multiple nodes
- accepting a bid is a transaction?
- ordering of bids as they come in
- invalidating bids once and reflecting that to a customer very quickly
Usually systems that are distributed that also need to be fast choose eventual consistency, but I am not sure how that would work in a bidding environment.  Any detailed resources (papers, blog posts, videos etc...) that I can review?  Thanks!

          <p>As a web designer, accessing online resources and tools is an essential part of your work. However, there are times when certain websites or services may be blocked or restricted, preventing you from accessing the content you need for research or inspiration. Sound familiar?
Online security and privacy are other concerns for professionals working in this field. That’s where proxies come in handy. These tools can provide web designers with greater flexibility, security, and performance when working online.
But before we explain how you can use them to make your projects more efficient and effective, let’s explore what proxy servers are and how they work.

          <p>In the past few days, I have read a lot about different variations of Flash Translation Layer. Most of them are designed for specific architectural designs. However, what about the most common solution that is widely used in today&#x27;s SSDs on the market? I know that this part of the SSD&#x27;s firmware is considered proprietary, as well as the device as a whole.
Any suggestions how this might be implemented?

          <p>Hey,
in my area, spring is arriving and while today we had some snow falling again, I’m regularly in my market garden again, planting vegetables, sowing radish, salads, carrots and more. It’s still such a great balance to my web work that I can only recommend having an outdoors activity to all those sitting in front of screens all day.
In my current projects, TypeScript, React and other tools are set as defaults. But I also realize that a lot of the standards I have in my mind are still not a default: responsive image optimization, bundle optimization, code splitting, performance audits and budgets, accessibility checks. Is it worth the effort of building type-safe code that in the end is transpiled anyway when we’re serving a nearly 1MB one-in-all JavaScript bundle containing scripts, sty…</p>

          <p>If you’re trying to build a single page application (SPA), you should probably use a tool designed primarily for the job. Site generators focused on performance, shipping low to zero-client-JavaScript (e.g. the one I work on, Eleventy) typically use full page navigations. SPA advocates have rebranded this architecture as a Multi-Page Application (MPA) but fundamentally this is how the web has always operated.
Classic multi-page architecture has a few benefits:
Better empty-cache performance: your site can render faster.

As web browsers become more privacy-focused and users spread their browsing across multiple web-capable devices, empty-caches visits are increasingly common.
Faster sites make more money. Read WPO Stats.
Search engines use site performance as a search ranking signal, which…</p>

          <p>I&#x27;m thrilled to share with you all a personal milestone in my life that I feel compelled to celebrate. My girlfriend, Julia, has been pursuing her dream of becoming a UX/UI designer for almost a year now while working in logistics, and today she has finally published her first project!
I can&#x27;t express how proud I am of her for putting in the hard work to make her dream a reality. It&#x27;s not easy to balance work and study (you know, sleepless nights to chase a dream), but she has done it with great determination.
Now that Julia has completed her first project, she&#x27;s excited to take the next step in her journey and is actively searching for job opportunities in UX/UI design. If any of you have any leads or know of any open positions in this field, we would be immensely grateful for any advice or guidance you can offer.
I know some of you may think it&#x27;s a small feat, but to us, it&#x27;s a significant accomplishment worth toasting. As a community of innovators and dreamers, I hope we can all take inspiration from Julia&#x27;s story and strive to follow our passions relentlessly.
Let&#x27;s raise a glass to Julia and all the aspiring designers out there who are working hard to turn their dreams into reality. Cheers!

          <p>A long read, but a worthwhile one - in my head their voice was definitely just shy of shouty! :)
Being a JS developer first and foremost since pre-Node days, it puts me in a funny spot that I absolutely agree with everything said in this article, whilst also considering that I pick JS on the server to suit me.
When it comes to the front-end, I&#x27;m pretty sick of the poison that&#x27;s been sold to us for over a decade.
The web&#x27;s war for JS libraries/etc summarised excellently with:

It’s a popularity contest. Plain and simple.


And that popularity contest can change on a dime.


10 years ago, it was AngularJS.


Today, it’s React.


Tomorrow, it will be something else because that’s inevitable.

Absolutely this - I felt exactly the same when I had peers and colleagues trying to shove Angular down my throat.
But it&#x27;s the future, the kids who come to the industry and will continue it. As Jared White writes,

but all those bright-eyed eager newcomers getting churned out of code schools knowing only React?


Those jobs will be gone. 😕

Grim future.

          <p>I have a little Etsy store for gameboy repair (though it&#x27;s currently just carts at the moment), and I had a Pokémon Crystal come in. It didn&#x27;t load at all and I found corrosion around the cart pins.
Carefully scratching away the solder had it loading up again, but the far right contact (the ground) had solder under the gold finger and I was worried it&#x27;ll eventually fall away. Originally I wanted to swap all the parts to a new PCB, but that requires actually purchasing another Pokémon Crystal (which sell for around £20-30) - which didn&#x27;t make sense.
Ultimately I cleaned as much as I could under the pad and then used solder mask to secure the gold finger down and now it&#x27;s secure and safe for a good many years of usage. Returned to a very happy customer :)</p>
