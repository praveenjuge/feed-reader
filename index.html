          <p>I made a chrome extension to extract styles from elements on a webpage. Its surprisingly hard to do without access to chrome debugger API in manifest V3. It doesn&#x27;t work for every site and I’m still improving it. A particular sore spot is with media queries but I&#x27;m working on a solution.
Any feedback is appreciated.

          <a href=https://css-irl.info/logical-border-radius/ target="_blank">Logical Border Radius</a>
          <p>Confession: I almost never write border-radius as shorthand, largely because I can never remember the order. My brain is wired to remember margin and padding shorthands (top, right, bottom, left), but when it comes to corners it’s a different story. Do I start from the top left corner, or the top right? So I usually resort to the longhand, which is admittedly verbose, but at least has the advantage of being explicit, for me and any future readers of my code. For the record, these are equivalent:
div {
  border-radius: 10% 20% 30% 75%;
}
div {
  border-top-left-radius: 10%;
  border-top-right-radius: 20%;
  border-bottom-right-radius: 30%;
  border-bottom-left-radius: 75%;
}
In the shorthand, we start from the top left corner, and go round clockwise, ending with the bottom left.

          <p>We started the Chrome Dev Insider series this year to bring you closer to the Chrome team, sharing what we are working on and how we approach our decisions. As we march towards the end of 2022, I thought it would be a good time to reflect on the past year.
I couldn&#x27;t think of a better person to talk about this than Parisa Tabriz, our VP of Engineering and Product. Parisa took the reins of our work on both the browser and the open web platform, earlier this year. I hope you enjoy this interview as much as I did.
Let&#x27;s start with your self-appointed &quot;Security Princess&quot; tag. What&#x27;s the story?
Parisa: I actually started my career in cybersecurity because a web application I built in college got hacked and defaced by spammers, and I was curious about what happened. (What happened was SQL inject…</p>

          <p>We are announcing a set of policy updates designed to encourage the development
of high quality products, prevent deceptive behavior, and ensure informed user
consent. These updates include:
Minimum Functionality Policy Update
—Expands our current Minimum Functionality Policy to include
click-baity template extensions, empty extensions, and extensions that do not
directly provide their stated functionality.
Misleading and Deceptive Behavior Policy Update
—Prohibits anti-virus, privacy, and security extensions that provide no
discernible protection or monitoring.
Affiliate Ads Policy
—Establishes new disclosure requirements for extensions that include
affiliate ad programs. Developers will now be required to disclose any
affiliate programs to users before installation. Additionally, related user
action is required before the inclusion of affiliate codes, links, or
cookies.
Developers can also learn more about today&#x27;s guidance in our Program Policies.
These policy clarifications will go into effect on January 15, 2023. After that
date, extensions in violation of these new policies may be removed from the
Chrome Web Store and be disabled.
If you have any questions, you can contact developer support.
Thank you for your cooperation, and for your participation in the Chrome
extension ecosystem!

          <p>WebPageTest has supported Google&#x27;s Lighthouse as part of our test suite for a while now, and there are a number of great reasons to choose to run Lighthouse on WebPageTest (accurate packet-level throttling, clean test environment with careful configuration to ensure accuracy and repeatability, always the latest version, etc. etc.)
That said, we&#x27;ve long felt that there were opportunities to make better use of Lighthouse results alongside WebPageTest&#x27;s broader test analysis. Today, we took the first steps towards that goal with a new Lighthouse result page that has a number of unique features we think you&#x27;ll find very useful.
A New Lighthouse Result Page
As of today, WebPageTest&#x27;s Lighthouse results will now be displayed like other first-party test result pages on WebPageTest:

          <p>It was always “Oh, you’re only at risk of automation if your job has a high degree of repetition, creative jobs are less at risk” but it feels like over the course of the past year Copilot, Dall-e, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and ChatGPT have decided upend that assumption. Writing, code, art… all with computers nipping at the heels with competency and speed. Fascinating. Unexpected in my lifetime. A mild bit alarming, but fascinating nonetheless.
I don’t think it’s all bad, but my brain is still ramping up to the new reality that these handicrafts have (likely) been permanently altered. We should celebrate the lower bar for creative endeavors; you no longer need to be an expert at Photoshop to produce a creative image, just an expert at generating prompts. People are extracting beautiful artifacts from these machines. Incredible.
As interesting a future this creates, I’m a member of an old caste of people that still believes massive gains don’t come without realized costs; or more explicitly, electricity isn’t the only cost. What if the cost we’re paying is our perception of reality itself? It’s increasingly likely that the next thing you read or watch is the product of a content extruder. Your favorite author, artist, creator, influencer, job applicant, or manager; the curtain pulled back to reveal a series of six word prompts. Rather than be left behind, I should start the augmentation process now…

          <p>Wanted to check out Golang so built a simple local RSS Digest reader, using any markdown reader as its GUI. I&#x27;ve been using it for the last 4 months and I am quite content with it, especially since my markdown files are synced on all devices, I can consume my daily brew from anywhere and anytime without any FOMO.
Features:
- RSS Digest: show only previously un-generated articles
- Interested Topics/Keywords (through Google News)
- Daily Weather
- Bookmark to Instapaper
- Show hot articles / comments link for Hacker News posts
Upcoming Features:
- Terminal mode
- Quote of the day (from r/quotes)
- Perhaps a daily calendar, to show today&#x27;s meeting 
- Accessing non-rss feeds (Twitter)
- Configurable for Weekly digest instead of Daily
Any feedback/idea is welcome :)

Something like this:
    Comment by Blah:
    The best is to use a template literal.
    
        Reply by Foo:
        I disagree, you should use str.replace and ignore
        template literals.
    
            Reply by Blah:
            Respectfully, you are an idiot. Ignoring template literals
            for a horrible regex has no place in JavaScript.
    
        Reply by wattle:
        I agree, and here&#x27;s a tangent that doesn&#x27;t have
        much to do with the topic.

Is it possible to style HN like that?

Basically let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m using Tailwind with React, and I frequently use the pattern:

Is there any tool out there that will analyze a project&#x27;s source and look for these patterns, and suggestions for creation of components out of them? I could have sworn I saw this as a VSCode Extension or something at one point.

I’ve tried four or five times now. Dozens of hours wasted learning frameworks and testing out themes and designs.
I don’t have thousands of dollars for a designer to come save me. So I’m feeling frustrated and lost at how to get something that’s serviceable so I can move on to the content.
Every blog I see linked on this website seems so nice in comparison!
For reference, my current attempt. I hate it. https://todays.pointless.click/

          <p>As a UX professional in today’s data-driven landscape, it’s increasingly likely that you’ve been asked to design a personalized digital experience, whether it’s a public website, user portal, or native application. Yet while there continues to be no shortage of marketing hype around personalization platforms, we still have very few standardized approaches for implementing personalized UX.
That’s where we come in. After completing dozens of personalization projects over the past few years, we gave ourselves a goal: could you create a holistic personalization framework specifically for UX practitioners? The Personalization Pyramid is a designer-centric model for standing up human-centered personalization programs, spanning data, segmentation, content delivery, and overall goals. By using thi…</p>

          <p>Chrome 108 introduced two new modes, Memory Saver and Energy Saver, to give users more control over how Chrome utilizes their system resources.
While these new modes are primarily user-facing, they do have some implications that are important for web developers to be aware of, as they can potentially impact the user experience of your site.
This post will cover the potential effects of these new modes and what web developers can do to ensure they&#x27;re delivering the best experience possible.
# Memory Saver mode
When Memory Saver mode is enabled, Chrome will proactively discard tabs that have been unused in the background for some time. This frees up memory for active tabs as well as other applications that may be running. Users can instruct Chrome not to discard tabs for specific sites; howe…</p>

          <a href=https://app.depoxy.dev/login/ target="_blank">Show HN: Depoxy – DataOps UI for the AWS data stack</a>
          <p>Hi HN,
During this year we have been building Depoxy, a tool for managing and optimizing data pipelines on AWS.
The main reasons for building Depoxy are:
the current UIs for managing data pipelines are inefficient
optimizing data pipelines has a lot of potential both in CO2 and financial terms
Where is this inefficiency coming from and how much better we can get?
The UI and the tooling around data services are not integrated at the level it is optimal. This is the reason why having an integrated UI improves the workflows by 50% (22s vs 54s). You can check out the video we have about a simple workflow.
How much optimization?
We have 10 years experience with various clients in this space and based on the previous experiences the optimization potential is between 10 - 30% year over year infrastructure cost. This is a lot for many companies, especially nowadays.
Where are we with this product?
This is the first iteration of the product and we just got started. The next iteration is going to be metadata analytics engine for data that is stored on AWS S3. Based on the metadata we can get insight into the efficiency of the data set and provide guidance for optimizing it.
The second next iteration we are planning to implement a SQL parsing engine that provides automatic data lineage so that people can track how data flows through their system.
Detailed blog post with a lot more:

          <p>Hey,
Will you recognize what the icons in the following link want to explain? I thought it’s a good quiz to ask my international friends here to find out how well these icons work. Now think about using only icons for an interface again. The idea of building these icons is to reduce friction in the user interface and to clean up endless text options but what is it worth if no one knows what the symbol really means? I myself struggle a lot when apps have text links for everything but the user login / registration or account link is a symbol that’s hard to identify (is it the login, the sign up, the logout icon?).

As the world increasingly becomes more connected, companies look for ways to tap into new markets and expand their customer base. One way they’re doing this is by becoming more diverse in their workforce. There are many benefits to having a workforce representing different cultures and backgrounds. It can also lead to more creativity and innovative thinking, as employees with different perspectives can bring new ideas to the table.
Remote work has become more prevalent in recent years, allowing employees to work from anywhere in the world. This gives companies access to a larger …</p>

          <p>Hi all
I remember finding (and subsequently losing the link to) a website a few months ago which outlined a process for requirements gathering and description based around an initiating event and the data transformations that should take place in response to it. All google searches I can think of lead to many articles about event driven software patterns. Hoping someone here knows what I&#x27;m referring to!

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;33862199 target="_blank">Ask HN: What are some communities for UI/UX design and code?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;ve found a few communities with great art and mockups, but they seldom have people discussing the code parts of design and those conversations are what I&#x27;m looking for.
I&#x27;d imagine that there&#x27;s a lot more overlap between developers and artists, I just need to find where that&#x27;s happening. Does something exist that&#x27;s like a cross between HN and Dribbble?

We went to my Mom’s in Houston for Thanksgiving this year. The weather was rainy and the kids went a bit stir crazy but we had a good time. We also had a small Friendsgiving the Sunday before; it’s a great feeling to have a house full of kids and friends around the kitchen island spinning stories. I’m thankful for my friends and family.
I resurfaced my interest in Qawwali music this month enjoying Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and the Nooran Sisters. I love it. The mix of storytelling and improv which has the potential to produce something like this…

Indistinguishable from a Fleet Foxes song if you ask me. Sitting on the floor with your buds, harmonium and tablas, singing and echoing phrases, and people throwing money at you; seems like a sustainable music business model…</p>

          <p>With DevTools, you can test how your website behaves and performs on any device without having to browse it on real devices.


Use the Device Mode to simulate a mobile viewport and configure it:
Set the device dimensions in various ways or use the presets.
Switch between landscape and portrait orientations.
Debug the @media min- and max-width breakpoints.
Choose a device to simulate or configure a custom one.
Simulate your page&#x27;s performance on mid-tier and low-end devices by throttling CPU and network speed.
Enable offline mode to test your website&#x27;s offline content, if any.

It turned out rather long &amp; detailed (shouldn&#x27;t have used those 4k, trending on artstation modifiers I guess), and it includes some (I think) pretty good ideas on optimizations (xFormers for the win), sharing on Gradio (never forget --gradio-auth), and GPUs in general (V100 is ).

          <p>I built a habit tracker https://flathabits.com to scratch an itch. I really wanted to do the right thing for the users. The driving principles were as follows:
- Privacy. These are your personal habits (and they stay on your phone). I want zero access to your data.
- Minimal friction. Habit tracking requires dedication, so it should require almost no effort to stay on top of it.
- No gimmicks. Really, no games, prizes, etc. Just want to build an effective tool.
- No lock-in. Your data is yours. It is saved locally to a text file you can inspect or export at any time.
- No sign-up or account. There really is no need for it. Period.
- No social. Social really just gets in the way. These are your habits, focus on them.
- No analytics. None of any kind. If you like the app or there&#x27;s a bug, just report it.
- Text-based. Not that it matters to many users, but all data is stored to a text file in org mode.
I&#x27;ve used the app thoroghly and managed to rack up a decent year and a half of continuous running and meditation amongst other habits. The app has 114 ratings (across all countries) with a 4.8 score. But, the app hasn&#x27;re really picked up many users (1-5 daily downloads) even as a free app.
So, what is this habit tracker missing? What do you actually want in a habit tracker?

          <p>I have over twenty years of software engineering experience and I&#x27;ve seen countless examples of architecture documents but I rarely see a high level design document that really stands out. I&#x27;m also surprised that there isn&#x27;t a de facto specification or book that I know of.
What are good examples or templates for a high level design that you use for describing distributed systems? Is there a book or similar resource that I&#x27;m missing?

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;33833125 target="_blank">Ask HN: Do RSS feed readers violate copyright (in 2022)?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;m building an RSS feed reader w/ Ads. One concern I have is to ensure that I dont violate any copyright laws. I googled a lot but I dont have a clear answer one way or the other.
Also, somewhat related, I believe LinkedIn lost the website scraping lawsuit. Does that mean we can now scrape all we want and I&#x27;m wondering if RSS feed reader fall into this category?
Appreciate any help in this regard! Thank you!

          <p>The Chrome team has been working on options to bring back full prerendering of future pages that a user is likely to navigate to. This modern reboot of prerendering will start rolling out from Chrome 108.
# A brief history of prerender
In the past, Chrome supported the 
 resource hint, however it was not broadly supported beyond Chrome, and it wasn&#x27;t a very expressive API.
This legacy prerendering via the link rel&#x3D;prerender hint was deprecated in favor of NoState Prefetch, which instead fetched the resources needed by the future page, but did not fully prerender the page nor execute JavaScript. NoState Prefetch does help improve page performance by improving the resource loading, but will not deliver an instant page load like a full prerender would.

          <p>Web crawling in this day and age is loaded with caveats, and must be done carefully as to not put an unnecessary load on other people&#x27;s infrastructure. I&#x27;d really like to try to make my own web search tool, so I&#x27;m trying to scope out something simple enough to get me started. Here&#x27;s what I have so far.
- I don&#x27;t want to parse anything in the SimilarWeb Top 50.
- I don&#x27;t want to render JS
- I&#x27;d like to keep a web index that is still measured in TBs
I&#x27;ve done search engines for research papers in the past. The key difference was that I could collect that data very easily through a documented API. Now I need to either build or use a crawler and I&#x27;m not sure where to begin. Here are some thoughts that I have so far.
- I&#x27;m probably going to write the crawler in Go. It seems like a good fit for this sort of software.
- How do I start collecting lists of domains? Do I just start hitting public IPv4 addresses on Ports 80 and 443?
- If I run something like this with proper rate limiting on a server, would Cloudflare inevitably just start blocking me?
- If I were to run this from a machine connected to the Internet via a residential ISP, then would I get a nasty letter from my ISP?
Any advice or feedback is appreciated. The goal of this project is to learn more about web crawling moreso than to build a product that would be sold.

          <p>I would like to introduce a library I&#x27;m currently working on. It is more similar to selectorlib - where it defines the Selector definitions in YAML file, but with the difference, that it supports more than one selector per field, which in turn allows you to have one yaml definition per different HTML variations of a website. It also tries to validate the selector expressions before running the parsing. At this point I am looking for some feedback, so I can improve.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;33819202 target="_blank">Ask HN: What do you want in a habit tracker?</a>
          <p>I built a habit tracker https://flathabits.com to scratch an itch. I really wanted to do the right thing for the users. The driving principles were as follows:
- Privacy. These are your personal habits (and they stay on your phone). I want zero access to your data.
- Minimal friction. Habit tracking requires dedication, so it should require almost no effort to stay on top of it.
- No gimmicks. Really, no games, prizes, etc. Just want to build an effective tool.
- No lock-in. Your data is yours. It is saved locally to a text file you can inspect or export at any time.
- No sign-up or account. There really is no need for it. Period.
- No social. Social really just gets in the way. These are your habits, focus on them.
- No analytics. None of any kind. If you like the app or there&#x27;s a bug, just report it.
- Text-based. Not that it matters to many users, but all data is stored to a text file in org mode.
I&#x27;ve used the app thoroghly and managed to rack up a decent year and a half of continuous running and meditation amongst other habits. The app has 114 ratings (across all countries) with a 4.8 score. But, the app hasn&#x27;re really picked up many users (1-5 daily downloads) even as a free app.
So, what is this habit tracker missing? What do you actually want in a habit tracker?

          <p>Accept-Language Reduction is an effort to reduce passive fingerprinting
surfaces by reducing the user&#x27;s language preferences in the
Accept-Language
header and only sending the user&#x27;s most preferred language (just one).
Beginning with the Chrome 109
Beta, we&#x27;ll open up
the origin trial
for Accept-Language Reduction enabling sites to opt into receiving the reduced
Accept-Language header. This will allow sites to discover and fix problems
before the reduced Accept-Language becomes the default behavior in Chrome in a
future release. To test the feature before it launches to stable population, be
sure to opt in and test before the release date for Chrome 109 (currently
scheduled for Jan 10th, 2023).
Check out the examples of Accept-Language header before and after the reduction below.

          <p># Overview
Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC) is a proposed web
standard that allows
customers to authenticate with a credit card issuer, bank, or other payment
service provider using a platform authenticator—typically activated with a
device&#x27;s screen unlock feature such as a fingerprint sensor. This usually
happens during a payments authentication protocol such as EMV 3-D
Secure or Open
Banking. EMV 3-D Secure, for example,
has support for SPC in its v2.3 spec
release.
We previously announced that SPC was
launched for Google Chrome on macOS and Windows and provided developer guides
for both registration and
authentication.
As of M109 (currently on the Beta channel), SPC will also be available on Google
Chrome on Android. Users will be able to use their device&#x27;s screen lock to
complete the …</p>

          <p>The latest iteration of First-Party Sets is ready for developer feature-flag testing from Chrome 108.
Ecosystem feedback has highlighted cross-site use cases that will be impacted when third-party cookies are no longer supported in Chrome. The First-Party Sets proposal examines and addresses a class of cross-site use cases in which the interdependent sites share a relationship that can be expressed to the browser such that the browser can take the appropriate action on behalf of the user and/or effectively present that information to the user.
The updated proposal uses two APIs (the Storage Access API and a new API tentatively named requestStorageAccessForOrigin) to provide sites with an active method of requesting cross-site access for their cookies within a First-Party Set. The instructi…</p>

          <a href=https://daverupert.com/2022/11/50-colors-akira/ target="_blank">They invented fifty colors for Akira</a>
          <p>I was reading about Akira the other day and stumbled across an interesting casual fact:
Painstakingly animated by hand, the care that went into Akira can be seen in every frame; there’s 327 different colour shades in the film, 50 of which were invented for it.
Fifty colors! Invented! An incredulous claim, but here’s a clip from a contemporaneous behind-the-scenes VHS documentary of Akria explaining the situation with the invented colors.

To accommodate the dark themes of the film and the five-stage variations of character shading, they added 50 shades of color to the commonly-used animation color palette. You can see the physical color palette in a couple places in the clip.
Kimie Yamana adding more… ahem… color… to the topic.
If you look at the color chart you’ll see the tremendous variety of dark tones. Many colors you wouldn’t see in other animation. There’s such subtlety in the various tones, you wouldn’t notice them on a television screen. But in the theater the large variety of colors really makes a difference.
Adding more, almost imperceptible, tones to the color palette allowed the neon-noir setting of a cyberpunk Neo Tokyo to thrive. Light plays a major role in the film and the use of color allowed the city itself to come alive as a character. A shadowy city that has light, life, and explosions.
Impressive. If you watch the whole behind the scenes video, you get a sense of the massive undertaking that was Akira. Blockbuster budgets and all the big name studios pitching in to make something bigger than themselves. Something timeless. Something breathtaking.</p>

          <p>Dragon’s Heaven is an eccentric anime directed by Makoto Hashimoto that —after hearing about it— I instantly dropped everything to watch it. It’s a giant robot mech anime with a Mœbius-”inspired” aesthetic. Actually, it’s a 100% rip-off of Mœbius, but it’s so well executed it stands on its own as something uniquely original (in a “great artists steal” kind of way). All the sand blowing and dimpled grunge effects that characterize Mœbius’s work were done by hand frame by frame… it’s a stunning work of art.
The sci-fi stands on its own as well. It’s the story of Ikuru, a girl in the year 3195 who awakens a robot named Shaian who has been dormant for 1,000 years. Shaian deactivated itself after a battle when its human copilot was killed in action. Shaian soon discovers his nemesis is still operational and doing battle in Brazil. It’s a Machines vs. Machines+Humans story with an assertive female protagonist. It makes you think about the relationships between humans and machines; will it be symbiotic or authoritarian? Also the notion that machines will outlive their human counterparts by millennia and hold on to centuries-long beef is interesting to think about as we feed machines with our biases in the present day.
But that’s not all! It gets weirder (beyond the awkward robot-human innuendo). The film is sandwiched between a poorly shot, ultra-smokey practical effects title sequence on the frontside and a documentary of how the director himself made the title sequence on the backside. It has the vibe of a gritty 1980s behind-the-scenes (like Alien or Star Wars) but also the air that no one could tell Hashimoto “No, this model thing isn’t good.” Some human quirks wrapped up in a film about two embattled robots.
If you’re curious about something called “Dragon’s Heaven” but has very little to do with actual dragons, I recommend it on the artwork alone. Feel free to skip all the non-anime parts.</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/webauthn-conditional-ui/ target="_blank">Passwordless sign-in on forms with WebAuthn passkey autofill</a>
          <p>Chrome 108 supports passkeys, including autofill suggestions. This allows sites
to build easy sign-in experiences that are more secure.
# What is a passkey?
A passkey is a digital credential, tied to a user account and a website or application. Passkeys are more secure than
passwords because they enable users to sign in to apps and websites with a
biometric sensor (such as a fingerprint or facial recognition), PIN, or pattern,
freeing them from having to remember and manage passwords. Because they are
WebAuthn credentials, they include the
following security features:
Passkeys use public-key cryptography so sites don&#x27;t have to store passwords or secrets.
Users can&#x27;t be phished because a passkey can only be used with the website or app that created it.
Websites could create and use WebAuthn credentials on devices and
security keys via a modal UI in the browser. To do so, websites had to
redesign their sign-in flow to let users select the WebAuthn flow using a
separate button. By allowing passkeys to enable autofill, websites can now
provide the same experience for both password and passkey users.
# Conditional UI
Allowing websites to make a WebAuthn request without triggering the modal UI is
called &quot;conditional mediation&quot;. This autofill integration is often referred to
as a conditional
UI.
          
  A user signing in with a condtional UI

# How it works
As soon as the user taps on the username input field, an autofill suggestion
dialog pops up with the stored passkeys and password autofill suggestions. The
user can then choose an account and use the device screen lock to sign in. This
enables users to sign in to the website with the existing password form as if
nothing has changed, but with the added security benefit of
passkeys.
# How to use conditional UI
To use the WebAuthn conditional UI, learn how to Create a passkey for
passwordless logins and Sign in with a
passkey through form autofill.

          <p>TL;DR: The Extensions API has been updated to support back/forward cache,
preloading navigations. See below for details.
Chrome has been working hard at making navigation fast. Instant Navigation
technologies such as Back/Forward Cache
(shipped on desktop in
Chrome 96) and Speculation Rules
(shipped in Chrome 103) improve both the going back and going forward
experience. In this post we will explore the updates we’ve made to browser

Prior to the introduction of Back/Forward Cache and prerendering, an individual
tab only had one active page. This was always the one that was visible. If a
user returns to the previous page, the active page would be destroyed (Page B)
and the previous page in history would b…</p>

          <p>You ever want to grab a still frame from a video you’re watching online? Here’s a trick I use from time to time to get video stills from HTML  and avoid all the fussy hover-activated UI bits.
Pause the video at the timestamp you want
Open the DevTools &gt; Console
Target the right context and paste this in the console…

const v &#x3D; document.querySelector(&#x27;video&#x27;)
let c &#x3D; document.createElement(&#x27;canvas&#x27;)
c.height &#x3D; v.videoHeight || parseInt(v.style.height)
c.width &#x3D; v.videoWidth || parseInt(v.style.width)
const ctx &#x3D; c.getContext(&#x27;2d&#x27;)
ctx.drawImage(v, 0, 0)
const wnd &#x3D; window.open(&#x27;&#x27;)
wnd.document.write(&#x60;&#x60;)


This will open a new page with an image captured from the current timestamp. Then you can right-click &gt; save as… or drag it to your desktop, whatever you want to do. Enjoy!</p>

I’m Adriana Jara. Let’s dive in and see what’s new for developers in Chrome 108.
# New viewport size units
The new viewport units give you more control to create adaptive UIs.
These units measure the viewport area differently, as they take into account UI elements in the browser that can be expanded or collapsed. For example, the address bar.

          <p>Try to fit in every general and conceptual detail when describing a very big concept and it’s likely that we’ll be confused. When you’re intent on explaining all of it, we glaze over. Consider switching gears and sharing the most specific possible example with impact and humanity instead. If we’re sold on where you’re going, […]</p>

When screen sharing starts, Conditional Focus allows the capturing web app to control whether the browser focuses the captured tab or window, or whether the capturing tab remains active.
The suppressLocalAudioPlayback option controls whether the audio playing in a tab would be played out of the user’s local speakers.
# Conditional Focus
Using Conditional Focus, web apps can now control whether the captured tab or window will be focused when capture starts, or whether the capturing page should remain in focus.
const controller &#x3D; new CaptureController();
// Prompt the user to share a tab, a window or a screen.

          <p>Twitter, it’s not me—it’s you.
In October of 2019, I gave a talk at Jamstack Conf San Francisco titled Owning your Content on Social Media.
For this talk I built a social media platform: MySpaceBook.​info, the only social media site exclusively for astronauts. Unfortunately midway through the presentation an investor called me up to make an offer on the site and I was left with no choice but to sell it, taking all of the user data down with it.
Apropros of nothing and in no way related to the scenario foretold in prophecy, I’m no longer hanging around on Twitter.
In the Jamstack Conf talk, I went through how one might build a local archive of your Twitter content, as I had done and documented separately a month or two prior. This archive now lives at zachleat.com/twitter/.
Cue crickets.

          <p>One of our family pandemic purchases was an electronic piano, a Yamaha P-121. My son was showing interest in music and we thought we’d be good parents and nurture that. His interest waned fast (read: in minutes), but I still play it! I grew up with a piano in the house so I’ve always been able to noodle, and I took a class in college, but I’ve never been able to fluently read sheet music enough to enjoy playing the piano. That is until I found E-Z Play Today music books1.

E-Z Play Today music books are beginner level books that take the mystery out of musical notation. Each note gets its corresponding letter inside it, no stacked notes, and bass chords written in a boxes above the staff. It’s guitar tabs but for piano and I love it.
Are they the exact notes? No.
Are the melodies just single notes? Yes.
Does it help me learn musical notation? Maybe.
Are almost all the songs transposed to the Key of C so they’re easier to play? Yes.
E-Z Play Today meets me where I am. It’s almost exactly what I want out of a song book; “Here’s the minimum viable version of this well-known song.” I have no dreams of becoming a concert pianist, I just want to enjoy playing the piano without feeling illiterate and uncoordinated. My left hand is playing a melody and my right hand is holding down a chord. Easy.
As dumbed down as this may be, I’m enjoying the approach and there’s a wide variety of genres and artists in their collection. I’m sure I’ll buy more. I broke out the Christmas song book in November and it’s been a small bit of joy to fill the house with some holiday spirit.

          <p>I am writing a web app with the intention of evolving the app as and when the requirements evolve.
While writing the code I am faced with the dilemma of whether to just provide mechanisms at the lower level and push the policy handling at the higher levels, or just flatten the design and handle both mechanism and policies at the same level.
There are pros and cons of both approaches.
So how does one overcome this dilemma when dealing with evolving requirements?

          <p>Genuine question: if one were to architect a web app to use disk for storage, rather than a database, how would one do it?
Lately, there&#x27;s been a lot of buzz about SQLite, and I myself have been impressed with DuckDB. I&#x27;ve also found myself doing my prototyping using plain JSON files on disk, and then &quot;productionizing&quot; to use a database when I need to deploy.
So: suppose I wanted to be able to have multiple web servers - it&#x27;s nice to be able to create more servers as needed - read and write data to a disk. What would one do? What&#x27;s the easiest way to share files across multiple servers? How do you ensure you have enough disk? Or partition traffic?

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;33730173 target="_blank">Predicting an enormous waste of time building UI frameworks with WASM and WebGPU</a>
          <p>I am willing to bet (inflation-adjusted) 1000$ that in the next decade, multiple teams will see the advent of Wasm and WebGPU as a perfect reason to have yet another go at a cross-plattform UI framework. These projects will claim to have &quot;native&quot; UI elements, but it will be obvious that the are really just rebuilding everything to look like the native counterparts (similar to Flutter). Especially on macOS and iOS, major interactions will be unsupported or implemented in wrong ways (problems will likely occur around the menu bar, keyboard navigation, and integration with OS services). Scrolling will feel off on touchscreen devices and text rendering will differ from the native look. Still, some of these frameworks will have tens of thousands of stars on GitHub and be used by major companies. I would not be surprised if these frameworks were built with Rust and be seen by many as the thing that would finally bring Rust to the mainstream. I see it as likely that in whatever language these frameworks will be written, they will introduce some weird new syntax and paradigms to accomodate a more &quot;intuitive&quot; (probably declarative) style of writing UI code. Meanwhile, little to no progress will be made developing techniques and frameworks to build apps that are actually better for the end user.

          <p>I worked for a large cooperation where senior engs. would design the overall layout of our services, and we (junior) focused on implementation. Now I work at a startup and am involved design decisions. Therefore, I would like to learn about software design and architecture. About the application, we are
medium-sized company and in a range where computations could run on a local machine (no-big data) but the data themselves can vary a bit from customer to customer.

Pardon me if this is not allowed here, you can remove this if this is not allowed.
I’ve finished learning basics of HTML and CSS indvidually. I.e topic by topic w/o creating a project.
If you want to know the topics that I’ve learnt, I’ve learnt around everything contained in the book “learning web design by jennifer robbins”.
Now, I want to do some projects using only html and css. Please share some beginner friendly projects(websites) to do. I’m really stuck and unable to create any projects even though I know the basics. And it’s really scaring me away from programming.
I don’t want to look at tutorials that make projects because IDK but that doesn’t help me at this point. They’re building websites with their own thought process and I ha…</p>

          <p>Here’s a video of a guy knocking down a grain silo with a sledge hammer. I love this video because it reminds me of simpler times where we watched idle videos on the internet all day instead of the staring in abject horror at the endless timeline. A single man knocking down a silo, what a metaphor for our current times! The silo falling also reminds me of an old Texan-ism by former Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn:
Any jackass can kick a barn down, but it took a carpenter to build it.
Now we are barn-less. Silo-less. Wandering open pastures for the next watering hole.
Wherever you end up I want to offer an idea; you are the value. Your ideas, your insights, your compassion, your ability to help someone in need, your dumb puns and dank memes; that’s what’s valuable. This situation has me th…</p>

          <p>We’ve deviated from developing v5.3.0 to ship a new patch release, Bootstrap v5.2.3, with a handful of more urgent bug fixes.
Highlights
Added the missing :root CSS variables to our utilities bundle
Fixed the deprecation warning with Sass 1.56.0
Fixed the RTL translate() direction for carousels
Fixed tooltip and popover disposal inconsistencies
We’re heading right back to it with v5.3.0 with support for color modes, new utilities, and more. Look for a pre-release of that soon.
Get the release
Head to https://getbootstrap.com for the latest. It’s also been pushed to npm:
npm i bootstrap@v5.2.3


Read the GitHub v5.2.3 changelog for a complete list of changes in this release.

          <a href=https://adamsilver.io/blog/page-title-conventions/ target="_blank">Page title conventions</a>
          <p>A page title or document title describes a web page.
It’s the content that is placed inside the  element and appears in the browser window or tab.
The title is important because:
it’s the first thing to be announed in screen readers
it distinguishes your website from other open websites
it helps search engines to index your website
I recommend the following structure with hyphens inbetween:
name of page (usually the h1 heading but not always)
section name (if applicable)
name of service
Here are some examples based on Amazon’s website.

October 28, 2022: El*n M*sk finishes a (forced?) hostile-takeover acquisition of Twitter.

          <p>TL;DR: Support for aria-readonly is nearly non-existent for the roles I tested. Should you need it, you cannot rely on it. You will be better off revising the pattern where you think you need it. For some background, the aria-readonly property: Indicates that the element is not editable, but is…</p>

          <p>I made this to simplify UI creation for developers. I use the Chrome console to reference how UI is built, but finding it in the first place is a bit of a pain. It also strikes me how npm has a lot of component and component libraries published there but there isn&#x27;t a visual way to search and browse them. This is a first attempt by simply scraping UI code and presenting it a visual, searchable way.

          <p>I am looking for tools or frameworks that are great at taking REST / GraphQL endpoints and help in making sleek Admin UI as fast as possible.
To avoid XY Problem. I have access to REST / GraphQL but I can’t access the DB directly. Hence I can’t use a $name headless CMS.
Tools like Hasura or  Postgraphile are amazing tools that generate REST / GraphQL API to a database. 
db -&gt; REST / GrapQL
Headless CMS like Directus (my favorite) or Strapi are amazing in providing Admin UI on top of SQL DB. 
db -&gt; Admin UI + REST &amp; GraphQL
I am looking for something that would do this:
REST &amp; GraphQL -&gt; Admin UI
It feels like there are some tools that do that, but I don’t know anyone who has experience with any of them.
Anyone has any ideas or recommendations? 
Would prefer to have an option to add custom code too.
Free, cheap, open source or self hosted would be the best &gt;:)
Some tools that claim to do what I need, but not sure about it

          <p>Hi,
I am working on a small game. I have developed simple apps with in game wallet/currency. Want to see what is the best way to implement wallets for tracking transactions like 
  1. Adding money to wallet
  2. Moving wallet amount from user A to user B
  3. Withdraw money from wallet 
  4. Running audits to ensure all transactions are correct
on a Relational DB. Would appreciate your personal experience in desingning this or working with a commercial solution ( doesn&#x27;t charge by number of transactions :) ). One article that I liked but its more suited for a nosql database is by AWS https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/building-a-serverless-wallet-service-for-in-game-currency/

          <p>It is, by far, the fastest-growing social network in history, growing more than 20% in about a week. And yet it didn’t stutter much. How can this be? It’s a network in the real internet sense of the word. It’s not just a network of users, it’s a network of servers as well. No one […]</p>

So, “I’m sorry this came out of the kitchen after your other dishes,” becomes, “thank you for waiting so patiently.” And, “I’m sorry we got disconnected,” becomes, “thank you for calling […]</p>

          <p>In recent weeks, a handful of people asked me what’s been happening in Web Components Land. Well, as President of Web Components, I have good news and the state of Web Components is pretty strong right now.
I did my Frontend Masters course on Web Components in April and since then there’s even more positive momentum happening in the Web Components space. Here’s a high-level list of developments over the last 6 months or so:
According to the 2022 Jamstack Survey “Web Components have arrived” (jamstack.org)
Brad Frost talks about web components (bradfrost.com)
Safari is prototyping Declarative Shadow DOM (github.com)
Element Internals is under development in Safari (github.com)
Webkit turned on Constructable/Adopted Stylesheets (github.com)
Eleventy introduced WebC … which isn’t capital-”WC” Web Components, but shares a similar ethos
Enhance.dev is a whole framework built on web components
Web Components Community Group collected their list of top concerns for TPAC
Exciting times. When I filmed my course, these more advanced Web Component concepts (Declarative Shadow DOM, Element Internals, Adopted Stylesheets, etc) were a smidge depressing to talk about because of their unknown Safari status. I could say the technology existed, but provide no roadmap for when it would get better support. But, if I’m reading these standards positions right, hopefully the consumer branch of Safari will support them soon.
On top of more feature support, more tooling is also great news for Web Components. Alternate takes, different ideas, varied perspectives! While it can cause some confusion when navigating the Web Component waters, the more perspectives the better for these little building blocks.

          <p>What I will be doing here is kind of an experiment to explore tricks that leverage a bug with the way CSS gradients handle sub-pixel rendering to create a static noise effect — like you might see on a TV with no signal.

          <p>Coming from WPF and Winform, I find web development to be unnecessarily complex, but I refuse to believe that’s true.
I just want to make a simple web app, no React, Angular or any of that. That can’t be too hard right? I’m sure in large scale, that stuff has its place, but I don’t need it. To me, the browser is the UI framework.
When I Google around to get started, I find obnoxious Medium articles. I don’t want to copy and paste instructions and throw something together without a clue what’s going on. Mozilla has good documentation, but I don’t know what’s a good source to actually get a web app running locally that I can eventually deploy online. Do I really need Node? Compared to WPF/Winform this is a mess, or so I hope not.
I want to make a simple app where users can create and fill out a form. ATC test plans, to be exact.

          <p>https://codepen.io/pelko/pen/zYaEpqr
I&#x27;m learning responsive design. (Make width     position: static;

    width: 100vw;

  }

This is the behaviour I&#x27;m getting with and without position:static. But I fail to understand why? All information that I&#x27;ve about position:static is that it doesn&#x27;t accept Top,Bottom,Left,Right values.
My teacher say &quot;it is floating without static...normal flow of document&quot; but I don&#x27;t get it.

          <p>I&#x27;ve listened to SID music on and off since the 80s, and mostly from early games and demos. Lately, I have explored more recent music. There are online lists of peoples favorite SID music, and online players, see [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]. Because I have different tastes, I had the motivation to make my own list and UX. So from january 2020 to september 2022, I listened through the HVSC having over 50k songs, resulting in a list of 600-700 favorites. I put together a UX so I can easily access them. This project is mostly for my own enjoyment, but I guess that many others here would also enjoy it. Please let me know if you have suggestions for songs I should reconsider adding, or some feedback on the UX.

          <p>Hey,
it’s crazy how much news we get for CSS this year. But along with it, we get tutorials how to use the new things and how to enhance with JavaScript. It’s nice to see how web development evolves, cross-browser support is great for most of the things and we can focus on building great experiences. The result is for example Mastodon, a communication service built on web standard protocols, independent of big tech companies. Or Pixelfed, or PHP, the language that drives most of our server software. Web Components finally get some traction as more and more vendors of widgets build libraries around it. Thanks to all who help the web standards evolving, who help other people by creating open source solutions, to those who write how-to-use articles and to those who share them. Enjoy this week…</p>

          <p>Hi, I was building a productivity app with some twists for myself and thought to share it with people of HN too if anyone might find it useful.
The basic idea is : 
1) Working together in rooms
2) Track your progress and goals with milestones instead of daily tasks completed because I feel in the end we all have a goal to work towards.
Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!
