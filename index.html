Seems Microsoft is trying to unify dev experience around React 
https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/wiki/FAQ---Fabric-and-Stardust-to-Fluent-UI
&quot;Our end goal is to unify these things. One styling solution, one theming solution, one set of utilities, one set of component authoring patterns, one set of components, one documentation site.&quot;
Is it mature? Worth to invest time and follow in coming years?

          <a href=https://adamsilver.io/blog/designing-a-time-input/ target="_blank">Designing a time input</a>
          <p>Entering a time is challenging because:
a time is made up of hours, minutes and a period (AM or PM)
there are many different formats for the same time like ‘12am’ ‘24:00’, 12.00am’, ‘12a.m.’ and ‘00’
Here I’ll explain why I recommend using a single text input for time.
But first, I’ll explain how to avoid the complexity of entering time in the first place.
# How to avoid making users enter a time
When it comes to forms, whenever we can help users avoid having to fill them out in the first place, we should.
When it comes to time there are certain ways to do that.
For example, I’m working on a service that has a closing time field for a job advert.
We could avoid making users enter a time by automatically setting the closing time to 11:59pm.

          <p>I am new to embedded PCB design. I can find lots of resources such as video tutorial or the schematics for the power, adc, dac, etc.
But I cannot find any hands-on tutorial on SDRAM, neither software nor hardware connection. I don&#x27;t know what those pins on SDRAM are for and how can I connect them to the MCU.
Is there any book about this topic?

          <p>I can&#x27;t believe I am just finding out about https://github.dev a vscode interface for any github repo. For example: https://github.dev/expo/expo
Add a custom search engine in Chrome and you got yourself a quick shortcut to opening any repo in github dev. In the past I would clone repo then open with vs code to monkey around. Now its CMD+L , &#x27;gd expo/expo&#x27; to open https://github.dev/expo/expo/

          <p>I like to write articles about technology or to create tutorials.
I&#x27;m starting to feel the need to know how to structure them visually in a way that makes the right information standout. Sorry, if this is not very clear.
For example, I find that just using headings is not enough for this.
Does anyone have any reading resources about how to use design to improve readability? I think that&#x27;s basically what I need.

          <p>Hi HN!
Here&#x27;s what I am searching for, but haven&#x27;t found yet: a website that offers the releases of software as RSS feeds.
I imagine that after logging in, you can search and select software products (from Github, from Gitlab, or even proprietary,...). You then get one RSS feed which combines all releases into one stream.
Creating multiple streams that combine by topic, programming language or whatever would be great too.
Does something like this exist? Or something similar? I know that Github offers feeds for single projects, but it feels tedious to add like 50+ single feeds to the reader.
Thanks for any tips!

          <p>Which companies hire for hybrid Developer/Designer roles? 
I feel that sometimes that&#x27;s a really fulfilling role for some people (like me) and wondering where I could be paid for that (most jobs are either or one of the two positions).
Furthermore: has anybody worked in a similar role in a tech company and can share their experience?
Companies I&#x27;m aware already:
- Basecamp (designers owning the styling part of the FE)
- Ashby (recently saw some open positions about it but not exactly sure how it works there)
Thanks

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;33197429 target="_blank">Why is it so difficult to design digital baseband (e.g., LTE) chips?</a>
          <p>The LTE digital baseband market was famously dominated by Qualcomm, which maintained a 60+% market share for nearly a decade (2009-2019).  MediaTek also successfully entered the market, but not for high end phones for high-income markets (U.S., Europe, etc.). Famously, both Intel and Broadcom (two semiconductor firms known for their ability to design successful chips in other markets, e.g., MPUs, cable modem chips, WiFi chips, Bluetooth chips, etc.) attempted to enter the market and failed. Broadcom exited the market and wound down their LTE business unit. Intel sold its group to Apple, which now has gone on to fail to develop a 5g digital baseband solution (Apple continues to use Qualcomm for its 5g digital baseband solution).
Why (from an engineering perspective) is it so difficult to develop an advanced  LTE (or 5G) digital baseband chip such that even semiconductor powerhouses like Intel and Broadcom have struggled to develop solutions which compare to Qualcomm&#x27;s offerings?
Note - answers from semiconductor design engineers appreciated :)

Eleventy is a static site generator created by Zach Leatherman who came to this TKYT session to give me a beginner&#x27;s crash course on building static sites with Eleventy.
For folks more experienced with Eleventy, skip to the WebC portion that begins at almost exactly 1:00:00!</p>

          <p>We&#x27;re building an app that helps people manage their schedules, tasks, and notes all in one place.
The goal is to create a personal workspace where people can manage their days and weeks on a single screen, set their personal and professional priorities, access a single schedule combined of all their calendars, and navigate through their days without switching between multiple apps.
At the moment, we&#x27;ve implemented bi-directional Google calendar synchronisation, various types of tasks (e.g. daily, weekly, &quot;until done&quot;),  and basic note-taking functionality.
Also, Emery has some things we really wanted to see in other apps – private notes for meetings, group editing of overdue tasks, categories that can be used to group tasks/notes/meetings together, and weekly productivity reports.
Currently, it&#x27;s a web app for desktop. A standalone desktop app is coming soon.
Happy to hear any feedback and answer any questions!

Please share your use-case and how switching to this platform did (or perhaps didn&#x27;t) improve your productivity and overall work experience.

          <p>This is not for &#x27;deep&#x27; or &#x27;slow&#x27; reading with intention and focus. The idea is that you have a large pool of incoming stories and you aren&#x27;t interested in &#x27;reading&#x27; all of them, but you want to reduce the chance of missing a single story. You want to &#x27;screen&#x27; all stories.
This UI explores a &#x27;mark-and-clear&#x27; idiom; you mark a group of stories as &#x27;read&#x27; and then you clear that group, purging the stories from your view completely.

          <p>I have a systems design interview coming up, and I&#x27;ve never participated in one before. What can I expect to be asked? 
Is it a high level design to talk through, or is in an in depth design, trying to justify different services and weighing up the pros and cons of aws v azure etc?

          <p>Interested in helping improve DevTools? Sign up to participate in Google User Research here.

 
Let’s admit it, writing automated tests is not the most fun thing in a developer’s life. As developers, we want to write features, fix bugs, and improve the world! However, when we don’t have automated testing in our workflows, in the long term, things can get quite “buggy”. So, we also think that writing automated tests is important.
With the Recorder panel in Chrome DevTools, you can record and replay user flows, export them to various formats (for example, test scripts) through different third-party extensions and libraries, customize the user flows with Puppeteer Replay library, and integrate them with your existing workflows.
In this blog post, we’re going to discuss:

          <p>The Chrome team has been working hard to build new capabilities, though we&#x27;re
responsible for only a small fraction of the work. Web app developers depend
on countless others in the community to build a strong ecosystem of APIs, tools,
demonstration apps, and other materials. That&#x27;s why earlier this year, we
announced the Advanced Web Apps Fund.
We&#x27;ve sponsored 11 projects, distributing more than $100k through the
Open Collective,
to recognize the importance of these projects and enable their creators to
spend time on them. These projects include:
Espruino Web IDE: makes coding Espurino boards
as easy as opening a web browser.
iPlug2: a free open source framework
for making audio plugins with minimal code.
PocketBase: open source realtime backend with
embedded database, real time subscript…</p>

          <p>Hello,
I built this web UI to merge multiple tree based e-commerce categories into one &quot;super tree&quot;.
You can export the super tree as JSON, and import it into another system such as a search engine.
Users can then select a single category and view items from all of the semantically equal categories.
The app is here: https://app.tree-merge.com/
You can download the sample categories and use them to demo the UI.

I’ll write down my fear and then write a test that attacks, and eventually relaxes, that fear. There are two actions that I’ve been frequently using with test writing: skipping all but one test or single tests. […]

          <p>Container queries are a new CSS feature that enables you to write styling logic that targets features of a parent element (for example, its width or height) to style its children. Recently, a big update to the polyfill was released, coinciding with support landing in browsers.
In this post, you will be able to take a peek inside how the polyfill works, the challenges it overcomes, and the best practices when using it to provide a great user experience for your visitors.
# Under the hood
# Transpilation
When the CSS parser inside a browser encounters an unknown at-rule, like the brand new @container rule, it will simply discard it as if it never existed. Therefore, the first and most important thing the polyfill must do is transpile an @container query into something that won’t be discarded…</p>

          <p>Hi HN,
My friend tries to land her first job as UX. She had a maternity break from work, was working as buildings designer before. I can see she is slowly descending into depression since she gets rejected without being given feedback. Most recently she has gone through a series of interviews with the company, got to the final stage and was rejected- without any feedback. And this after investing her time into preparing assignments and taking tests...
I try to coach her out from depressive thoughts she is getting, but it&#x27;s not really helping. If I was running a company I would take her onboard, she wants to be UX but I think she would do whatever the current need would be to provide value.
Do you know of anyone looking to get junior UX? Any advice would be of great value to her, thanks in advance!

          <p>HTML is over 29 years old today. You must have used it in many projects during your career.
Perhaps the first time was modifying MySpace or some 90s/2000s social media site.
It&#x27;s used for laying out pages, adding buttons or building whole UIs. Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera all implement some latest standard of HTML.
What&#x27;s your biggest issue with HTML today in 2022?
What&#x27;s the one big thing you would change?
Which of your needs are not being met with HTML as it is today?

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;33118819 target="_blank">Ask HN: What would you consider to be essential reading for database design?</a>
          <p>Aside from a foundational understanding of database operations I really lack the proper knowledge to make proper design descisions for my databases and aplications that interact with those databases. There arent many people at my company that are particularly wise when it comes to this topic and it feels like we are really missing out on some really simple improvements just because we are oblivious to them.
Are there any recommedations for essential reading or proper practice guides for improving database skills? I&#x27;m reading &#x27;Database Internals&#x27; by Alex Petrov and its really interesting so far but not so practically applicable for me at the moment. It would be great to hear any resources that made a real impact on how you went about working with databases.
I&#x27;m mainly interested in SQL databases but resources on no-SQL would be welcome too.

          <p>Thank you to all of you that participated in helping CSS pick a nesting
syntax. The CSSWG has discussed the results and has
decided to move forwards with @nest. This unblocks the syntax issue, enabling
the @nest spec to move forward.
# Results
Out of 7,590 total votes, @nest was a clear winner:
87% of respondents voted for @nest, 5% for @nest always, and 7% for
brackets. Such a large split was not estimated but is relieving to the
discussions.
# What&#x27;s next?
The CSSWG will continue to discuss the feature and move on to other issues.
You&#x27;ve all helped us very much, we really appreciate the time you took to
evaluate the options and provide feedback.</p>

          <p>In this post, we&#x27;re excited to share some significant improvements to the Chrome Extension getting started experience and a few ways you can be part of this dream.
# The old guide
Previously, the Chrome Extension Getting Started tutorial was a basic extension example that changed the background color of the current page when the user clicked a button in the extension popup. It also included an options page where you could pick one of four colors.
This basic example didn&#x27;t demonstrate how to add popular capabilities featured in real-world extensions. It was time for a revamp.
# A new approach
We know developers rely on our documentation to begin their Chrome extension learning journey, and our goal is to provide a path that is accessible, beginner-friendly, and relevant. Instead of trying t…</p>

          <p>Components have been an often requested feature in Eleventy. While I do consider it an unanswered question whether or not components are the best starting point for new developers, it’s hard to argue with the efficiency and delivery gains to be had for folks with a bit more experience.
Now, we could wait around for the heavier bundler-based frameworks to circle back and pretend like React server components are a revolutionary new pattern for HTML without JavaScript (can you imagine). But if I might be allowed to offer a well-argued and intellectually-bulletproof counterpoint: naw.
A History of Component-like Things #
Historically, Eleventy has offered a few component-like features. Before we move on, I think it’s worthwhile to go through the prior art here (for Eleventy specifically).

          <p>I’ve been noticing that I tend to spend a disproportionate amount of time in my personal projects trying to figure out the UX look and feel.
I have very little difficulty translating well made designs into whatever framework I’m working in, but struggle with creating those designs, especially when starting from scratch.
Are there any resources, advice, or mindsets you can give/recommend to help me improve this part of the process?

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/overflow-replaced-elements/ target="_blank">A change to overflow on replaced elements in CSS</a>
          <p>From Chrome 108, the following replaced elements respect the overflow property: img, video and canvas. In earlier versions of Chrome, this property was ignored on these elements.
This means that an image which was earlier clipped to its content box can now draw outside those bounds if specified to do so in a style sheet. The default browser style sheet clips the overflow to the content box with the following rules:
img {
  overflow: clip;
  overflow-clip-margin: content-box;
}
However, it is possible for your stylesheet to override this behavior by setting overflow: visible. The following examples show some cases where you might now see unwanted overflow.
The object-fit property is used to scale the image and fill the box. If the aspect ratio does not match the box, the image will draw outside of the bounds.
img {
  object-fit: cover;
  overflow: visible;
}
The border-radius property makes a square image look like a circle, but because overflow is visble the clipping no longer occurs.
img {
  border-radius: 50% 50%;
  overflow: visible;
}
Setting inherit: all and causing all properties to inherit, including overflow.
img {
  all: inherit;
}
# Solution
If this change means you see unwanted overflow, and overriding the overflow property to visible is not intentional, inspect the CSS applied to the element via DevTools. This should allow you to identify the CSS declaration which is overriding the overflow property to visible and remove it or update it to clip.
img {
    overflow: clip;
}
If updating the CSS is not trivial, another fix is to add the following inline style to the element.</p>

          <p>I&#x27;m Paul Kinlan, and I lead developer relations for Chrome. As part of my job, I get to work with a team of passionate web advocates who are tasked to bring the perspective of real world developers to our product and engineering teams, with the north star metric to improve developer satisfaction.
We recognize that &quot;satisfaction&quot; is an ambitious and subjective metric to track and improve, so we constantly iterate on how we can make an impact while focusing on developer needs. A guiding principle we&#x27;ve found useful to follow is—&quot;meet developers where they are&quot;. A recent Stack Overflow study showed that 75% of developers report using frameworks or an abstraction of some kind. So we&#x27;ve been asking ourselves how we best serve developers who have already made decisions about, or have no control …</p>

Every morning you decide what you will do and what you will not do by swiping away objectives and only keeping ones you want to focus on for the day. Throughout the day you can mark items as complete and check on what objectives remain.
I built Nodu to use myself (and to get my feet wet with SwiftUI). After reaching a V1, I decided to release it to the public.

          <p>A little while ago, Ana Tudor created an impressive collection of halftone patterns using only CSS. As I had a little time to spare, I thought I’d dig into the code and see how it was done! Ana’s demos are made using Sass — what better way to learn than to try to produce similar effects using vanilla CSS?

Ana’s demo uses Houdini to animate the halftone background (only supported in Chromium browsers). For the purpose of this article we’re just going to be concentrating on the halftone pattern itself, rather than the animation.

          <p>Bootstrap v5.2.2 has landed with new bug fixes and documentation updates—keep reading to see what’s changed!
Highlights
Accordion

Use Sass variable for the accordion color instead of an invalid CSS variable
Buttons

Undo changes to .btn:hover from v5.2.1. We now explicitly target .btn-check styles instead.
Dropdowns

Temporarily restore ability for dropdowns to work without an explicit data attribute (will be removed again in v6)
Modals

Improve modal event listeners
Use 
 for all .modal-title instances in our docs
Tables

Don’t redefine $border-color in table-variant() mixin
Tabs

Tabs no longer autofocus and cause pages to jump on tab.show()
Fix .active class toggling of tabs within dropdowns
Toasts

Properly set toast z-index on .toast-container as opposed to individual .toasts that don’t receive any other positioning
Tooltips

Fix tooltip selectors with title attribute on dynamically created elements

          <p>Hello!
Last ditch effort here - a year ago or so there was posed a link to a page which had wonderful visual and text descriptions of different battery technologies and their tradeoffs.  It illustrated 5-6 different dimensions which one might optimize for (e.g. charging speed, capacity, cost, lifetime, etc) on these little charts which looked a bit like spiders&#x27; webs.
I thought that was a great resource, but didn&#x27;t save it at the time.  Anyone know what I&#x27;m talking about or have a link? Thanks!

          <p>Hi HackerNews,
As an early stage Product &amp; Tech Founder, we often wonder what is the good timing to have a Design System.
- Do you think it&#x27;s too soon during the early days?
- How do you manage product consistency without it?
- Do frontend engineers complain about not having one?
Our Founding Designer &amp; Product Manager, Mike, took the mic and tell us why he thinks you should have a design system from day 1: https://www.getlago.com/blog/how-soon-should-you-have-a-design-system
Happy to have your thoughts on this!

          <p>Today, Tumblr has something for everyone, whether you’re looking for art, memes, counterculture, or design inspiration. Designers, especially young ones, are making a silent comeback to this revived platform, which was considered “abandoned” by many back in 2018.
So what’s attracting Gen Z creatives to the microblogging platform?
As younger generations make the conscious decision to leave social media due to its “toxic effects,” the only logical next step is to create your own community so that you can express yourself freely without being bombarded by ads or obsessing over likes. In many cases, Gen Zers have been left without a creative outlet after ditching social media platforms, and Tumblr fits the bill perfectly.

          <p>When we started Chrome Dev Summit (CDS) in 2013, our goal was to connect directly with the web community. Each year I&#x27;ve looked forward to meeting with developers, learning what they were working on, and hearing their needs.  As we weren&#x27;t able to meet in-person for the last two years, our online CDS events were the best way for us to connect through AMAs, workshops, office hours and more.
Each year, we plan our engagements based on the state of the ecosystem to ensure we are addressing developers&#x27; needs as best we can. This year, instead of hosting CDS and asking you to come to us, we&#x27;re meeting you where you are in your region, at your favorite conferences and events, and on various online forums such as Twitter Spaces. Check out the list of events where you&#x27;ll find the Chrome team and bookmark this page to get the latest updates.
I&#x27;m so excited to get back into the community and we look forward to connecting with you at a virtual event, GDG DevFest, performance.now(), or another summit near you!</p>

          <p>Sharing tabs, windows, and screens is already possible on the web platform thanks to getDisplayMedia(). We’re now shipping the following improvements that guide the user away from accidental oversharing:
Sharing tabs is now the default option, rather than sharing screens.
The displaySurface option can indicate that the web app prefers to offer a specific display surface type (tabs, windows, or screens).
The surfaceSwitching option indicates whether Chrome should allow the user to dynamically switch between shared tabs.
The selfBrowserSurface option can be used to prevent the user from sharing the current tab. This avoids the &quot;hall of mirrors&quot; effect.
The systemAudio option ensures Chrome only offers relevant audio-capture to the user.

          <p>Writing HTML sucks.
I&#x27;ve been making websites and web apps for almost 10 years. As a developer, I&#x27;ve never liked it.
React and Tailwind made it an infinitely better experience for me, but something was still missing. Switching between the code and the browser all the time felt wrong. At the same time, I felt lost with No-code editors because they are made for designers not developers.
I&#x27;ve written about it extensively here: https://rogovoy.me/blog/writing-html-sucks
Impulse is my experiment to bridge that gap and make a &quot;design&quot; tool that works directly with my code.
With Impulse, I&#x27;ve come to love web design (again?).

How did you get started in illustration?
Like many artists out there, it all began with drawing as a child. I’ve always been creative and have loved telling stories through both visuals and words. I took art classes as a kid and loved every second of it! However, when it was time to make a career out of it, I was nervous. I thought pursuing something like graphic design o…</p>

          <p>The DevTools Recorder panel lets you capture user actions on your page, replay, share, and export them to a variety of formats you can use in your CI/CD.
The Recorder panel is in active development and has recently added new features to help you edit, debug, and export recordings.


With the Recorder panel, you can:
Slow down the replay, set breakpoints, pause, resume, or advance the execution one step at a time.
When paused, interact with the page or switch to other panels for further inspection.
Add steps that the Recorder doesn&#x27;t automatically capture. For example, mouse hover that pollutes recordings otherwise.
Configure steps, for example, add timeouts, conditions, and assertions.
Export the recordings in various formats such as JSON, @puppeteer/replay script, and Puppeteer script.
Additionally, you can add more export formats using Chrome extensions for the Recorder panel. At the time of writing, you can add extensions for the following tools: Cypress, WebPageTest, Nightwatch, Testing Library, and WebdriverIO. Check out the full list of extensions.
For more information:
To learn the basics, see Record, replay, and measure user flows.
For a complete list of features, see Recorder features reference.

This change will give Chrome users increased safety and peace of mind while browsing and installing extensions by providing more transparency and control over permissions, adding stricter protocols for accessing resources outside the extension’s context, and ensuring that extensions work well on all devices.
Chrome will take a gradual and experimental approach to turning off Manifest V2 to ensure a smooth end-user experience during the phase-out process. We would like to make sure developers have the information they need, with plenty of time to transition to the new manifest version and to roll out changes to their users. In support of that goal, we’re providing more deta…</p>

          <p>What are good resources that can help an early stage founder in how to think of the design of their app/website. Since this is early stage, I am not planning on spending a lot of time on the design, but would be great to have some guides/books that can help with the basics. For example a checklist of things that you need to consider with advice on how to pick each (font, color palette, basic layout, etc..)

see what&#x27;s new for developers in Chrome 106.
# New Intl APIs
The Intl APIs help to display content in a localized format.

          <p>A complaint I sometimes hear about web performance metrics is that they focus too much on initial page load, unfairly skewering web apps that are actually fast but in different ways than traditional websites. The reasoning goes that many web applications are intentionally built more like native apps than like websites, prioritizing efficiency during lengthy browsing sessions after the web app is already open rather than optimizing for a first visit.
While I would argue that site delivery optimizations should not need to conflict with post-load optimizations (...and wonder if users carry their low performance expectations of native app startup time over to the web anyway), it is true that these represent different moments in user experience and need to be measured differently. Also, there a…</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32970485 target="_blank">Ask HN: Why aren&#x27;t modern mobile apps design to fail stable?</a>
          <p>I haven&#x27;t built mobile apps in years.  These days I carry an Android phone and am generally unhappy with how poorly these applications require a network connection to do anything. Many apps don&#x27;t fail stable in the sense that if there is a server error they don&#x27;t present the last known good view of data.  What this means in practice is if there is low network availability (on a train, at a concert or festival, a sporting event) many of these apps completely break.
Back years ago I would design apps to sync to a local database (which was relatively easy to do on IOS). Apps would maintain consistent state on the device and leverage local storage.  I haven&#x27;t looked under the hood but many apps appear to be using HTMLish front ends that are stateless, except for some cached login information.  As a user - what I see is that the app repeatedly tries to login and fetch all information every time you load it.  Which if you have perfect LTE/5G/WIFI is sort of ok, but in other situations sucks.  if the app can&#x27;t talk to the network it really doesn&#x27;t work at all.
Example apps that generally fail stable: gmail, text messaging
Sort of fail stable: slack, although if you get a push message slack requires talking to the network to get the message even though it came through the push message.  In practice this means significant latency between seeing the message on the phone and then going to the conversation view (which can take forever to load under poor networking).  Back when I built apps we stuck the contents of the push message in the local DB so it was visible for users

More knowledge means better instincts; better insights into opportunities for both you and your organization. You will ultimately produce better work if you give yourself the space to learn. Yet often organizations get in the way of …

          <p>I hate messing around with css and design is a real skill I haven&#x27;t taken the time to develop yet. I&#x27;m wondering if a tool exists that takes inputs: 1) raw HTML, 2) some webpage whose style I like (but don&#x27;t want to copy precisely). And outputs: HTML with styles applied.

          <p>I was using the Crunchyroll app on my iPad this weekend and noticed my level of frustration rising because the most annoying feature of the Crunchyroll iPad app is that while using it, I can do nothing else. The developers of the application didn’t add Picture in Picture or background play support. It’s either on fullscreen or off. The Funimation app has the same problem. While I’d like to watch anime while doing something else (shopping, Twitter, RSS, etc), I can’t.
On the web, this is only a minor annoyance. I open developer tools and…

document.querySelector(&#x27;video&#x27;).requestPictureInPicture()


I under-appreciate the ability to patch or coerce websites to meet my needs. That’s a feature of HTML, written in the by-laws as “consider users over authors”. As a user, I get the final say. Thi…</p>

          <p>This month I finished Michael E. Mann’s The New Climate War, a treatise on where we’re at with climate change. After my post on climate change a handful of people mentioned it and the book does a fantastic job at opening your eyes to the deflection tactics and information warfare that special interest groups (read, lobbyists) use to get you to talk about something other than their clients.
I could go on forever about ways this gross incentive system is destroying the world, but what I found most interesting about Mann’s book were the recurring cast of characters in the Climate Change disaster:
Activists - engaged and informed people, possibly with a plan of action
Inactivists - unengaged people, possibly adversarial
Technologists - people who (naively?) think we’ll solve the issue with tec…</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32941035 target="_blank">I continue to see improperly redacted images because of the iOS Markup UX</a>
          <p>I am a regular on a web forum where users quite often share screenshots from their iPhone, and in an attempt to redact identifying information in these screenshots, often do I find PII swabbed with the highlighting tool.
Even with the Opacity set to 100% and the color to Black, it leaves the sensitive information underneath visible (yes I understand this is a highlighter, move on this note below).
Before you tell me the proper way to do it, which is to ...
(once in Markup)
1. Tap the Plus button on the far bottom right
2. Select the Rectangle or Circle shape
3. Tap the Shape Options button in the bottom left (the icon used doesn&#x27;t even make it obvious as to what this button is for)
4. Select Solid Fill for the shape
5. Position solid shape over the sensitive information
...
My argument is that while it is possible to properly redact sensitive information, it&#x27;s much too easy for people to improperly redact because it is difficult to tell that a 100% opacity black highlighter does not work. On a phone screen, it can look completely opaque. Only once you see it on a better display do you realize just how visible the info is.
Also, while the pencil/pen tool (far left) does properly redact, its max size is much too small. People who use this one and just haphazardly try to scribble over all of the info, which sometimes works and sometimes doesn&#x27;t.
Solutions:
1. Create a tool specific for redacting
2. Make it so that 100% opacity highlighting is opaque (or at least warn the user if they set the opacity to 100%). Yes, this is not what &quot;highlighting&quot; is, but make the default opacity value like 30-50% and have people change it as needed. If it looks opaque on a phone screen, IT SHOULD BE.
3. Allow the user to set the max width of the pen/pencil tool much larger. Make it a sliding scale instead of 5 discrete sizes.

          <p>Last year I read the book 101 Things I learned in Architecture School. It’s a good book. Good enough, I thought I’d share 26 Things I learned from “101 Things I Learned in Architecture School”. Meta. A lot of this will, of course, be applied to web design.
6. We move through negative spaces and dwell in positive spaces.
This is probably the best argument I’ve heard for “why to use whitespace” I’ve ever heard. Negative/unused space makes the spaces with structure and/or content more impactful because we’ll dwell and feel more comfortable in the positive/filled-in areas.
This also explains why everyone ends up in my kitchen when friends come over.

          <p>One of my favorite #oldgold resources is Shmuplations; they scour old video game magazines and translate them to English. I love it so much I support the work on Patreon. Cruising through the archives, I found a translation of a 1989 issue of BEEP magazine which features one of my favorite sources of inspiration: Shigeru Miyamoto, creator of Mario.
When asked “What’s the secret to success in the game industry?” he had this to say:
Well, what’s worked for me so far is finding something I want to make that matches up with what the market currently needs.
If you believe in your idea, and that it’s something people will want, then all that remains is for you to polish and raise it to a sufficient level of quality. So no matter how talented of a staff you’ve been blessed with, if you don’t have a clear direction for your idea, I don’t think a good game will come out of it. The goal is for each staff member, individually, to contribute to the overall “finish” of the work, so it’s just a matter of having each person fulfill their role. And as the lead creator, even if the rest of the staff sometimes loses sight of the whole picture, it’s your job to hold the course and make sure you keep to that initial vision.
Unfortunately I’ve seen it happen many times where the developers get carried away with themselves, and they’re having a really good time, but it ends up harming the playability of the finished game.
Any time Miyamoto-san talks about “games” I map this to “websites” in my head. I’m endlessly inspired. These three short paragraphs contain multitudes.
Find something you want to make that matches up with something the market currently needs.
Polish and raise your idea to a sufficient level of quality.
You need clear direction for your idea, even with a talented staff.
The goal is for each staff member to contribute.
It’s your job to hold the course and keep to the initial vision.
Developers getting carried away ends up harming the end product
All of these. Tattoo them on my soul. Especially the last one.</p>

          <p>Experts have a word for it. If it’s important, conceptual or frequently discussed, there’s probably a domain-based word that experts understand. The precision of a special vocabulary allows them to do better work. But… Just because someone knows the word for it doesn’t mean that they understand, or that they’re a useful expert.

          <p>TLDR: if your site is Twitter, AirBnB, Apple, Reddit, CNN, FedEx, or so many others then probably yes!
Many of the most common performance problems in websites and applications today are caused by how they load and rely upon JavaScript, and the difficulty involved in solving those problems often depends on the degree of that reliance. When JS reliance is minimal, fixing poor delivery performance can be as simple as instructing the browser to load certain scripts at a lower priority and allow HTML content to render sooner. But when a site is dependent on JavaScript for generating its HTML content in the first place, those sorts of optimizations can’t help, and in those cases fixing the problem may require deep and time-consuming architectural changes.

          <p>I came across a Circuit Breaker Podcast episode called Understanding Prototyping to Learn. This episode is a MUST LISTEN! Bob Moesta and Greg Engle come from a hardware/manufacturing product development background but it all applies to prototyping on the web. Bob and Greg give some much needed language to the discipline of prototyping.
The roles of prototypes
Did you know your prototypes can serve different purposes? Bob and Greg have big buckets for them.
Learning prototype
Communication prototype
Milestone prototype
These are wonderful categorizations of the roles prototypes can play. I often prototype to learn. My CodePen is full of these. I often prototype to communicate: “Here’s some progress, here’s why something can or can’t work”. It lets everyone see and experience the same tangib…</p>

Ok. It’s entirely possible, probable in fact, that that last sentence sounded like complete and utter gibberish (it’s definitely a bit of a tongue-twister) but free performance wins are rare, so let’s take a closer look at what’s changing, and how to understand whether or not your site is one of those getting a free performance boost as a result.

          <p>On one hand, creating simple checkered backgrounds with CSS is easy. On the other hand, though, unless we are one of the CSS-gradient-ninjas, we are kind of stuck with basic patterns.
At least that’s what I thought while staring at …

When agency resources are limited, every hire represents a major decision point. Even more so when it’s your first recruit.
It raises multiple questions. Will a new team member possess the right skills to hit the ground running? Can they be trusted to work directly with clients? How will you manage them?
And when exactly is the right time to hire? If your agency moves too early, you could face cashflow problems and have a new team member with not enough to do. If you hire too late, you migh…</p>

          <p>The algorithm surfaced me a video of an architect explaining why they make scale models and 💥BAM💥 just like that I’m back on my prototyping bullshit. This time we’re learning about the how and why an architect might make a scale model of a project.
The idea of model making for me is to take advantage of this haptic connection between your hands, what you’re making, all the materials, and really create something that you couldn’t have predicted in a sketch.
A prototype exists to make a haptic connection between you and the materials, a 3D sketch. A tactile feel with actual atoms that the sketch could not reproduce. Although these materials are far from the final product, you get a sense of volumes, spaces, and their relationships to each other.
I’m going to try and render these as open sp…</p>

          <p>I am working on a marketplace project(Patreon-like) and I am wondering about good designs/architecture to handle and track the money. I have came up with various solutions but I would like to hear from someone who has some real experience with this very niche type of project, if possible.
Mostly the issue is real money vs virtual money in the system. Chargebacks, returns, currencies, multiple bank accounts, multiple payment processors, fees for bank or payment processors transfers that can make real money mismatch the virtual money and so on.
It&#x27;s not a simple question I could ask and get a straight answer so I guess it will be more like a discussion.
Tanks.

          <p>I have a number of simple projects that I&#x27;m happy to do the UI development for but feel their appearance or UX could use some critique from a more skillful designer. I&#x27;m not looking to hire someone to do designs for these small personal projects, but am wanting to pay for a 30-60 minute consultation to get general feedback and suggestions for improvement.
Any recommendations for finding folks interested in this sort of one-off design review work?
