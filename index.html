          <p>I have seen other posts where they predict GPT-4 will be able to write code and then rewrite that code to make corrections.
If you were going to make a code library that a GPT-4 like system could use in writing code, what features and aspects would you consider to make it easier for the AI to use?

          <p>Promises have changed the landscape of JavaScript. Many old APIs have been reincarnated to use Promises (XHR to fetch, Battery API), while new APIs trend toward Promises. Developers can use async/await to handle promises, or then/catch/finally with callbacks, but what Promises don’t tell you is their status. Wouldn’t it be great if the Promise.prototype provided […]

          <p>The idea that things become hits mostly due to a small number of large audiences rather than point to point viral sharing seems intuitively correct to me: www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/viralit…
Or at least the large audiences “seed” the viral behavior</p>

          <p>As employees return from holiday break, [Shopify] said it’s conducting a “calendar purge,” removing all recurring meetings with more than two people “in perpetuity,” while reupping a rule that no meetings at all can be held on Wednesdays. Big meetings of more than 50 people will get shoehorned into a six-hour window on Thursdays, with a limit of one a week.
This is fascinating to me.  I get the desire to remove bloated meetings, but there are recurring meetings that I find genuinely valuable to have sync (project standups / staff meetings).  Curious if this ends up being a long term policy for Shopify or more of a culture reset.</p>

Decision Making
⭐ How To Decide by Annie Duke - Annie Duke takes her poker background and applies it to making decisions in other contexts – lots of practical decision making strategies here
⭐ The Scout Mindset by Julia Galef — somewhat similar ground to to “How You Decide”, but more of a focus on viewing the world objectively.  I really enjoyed reading these 2 books together.
Productivity
⭐ Make Time by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky — A nice book full of practical tips for managing your time and reclaiming control from distractions

          <p>I’ve written and rewritten this five times and decided to go with a brief, brutal, bulleted list of a December I don’t want to experience again.
Stacking viruses ran through our kids over the course of three weeks. My immune system was shaky but held on. It culminated in ear infections in both kids and I learned the city of Austin has a shortage on antibiotics. New, incredible ways the American healthcare system can fail that I never anticipated.
This month ended in some sadder news that after a series of tests and treatments we’ve learned that our 13 year old dog Rudy has Transitional Cell Carcinoma, a form of bladder cancer that is inoperable and non-responsive to radiation and chemo. The outlook is not good, a matter of weeks or months, and we’re already at weeks. Holding out hope the k…</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34222749 target="_blank">Ask HN: How much productivity do you think is lost by sitting vs. standing?</a>
          <p>Spent the last 3 years in home office where I have a standing desk setup. Came into a coworking space today with no standing desks. Feel like I’m half asleep. I can’t be any more than 50-60% as productive as when I was standing!
Crazy that we know sitting is bad for you. How much productivity change, if any, have you felt if you’ve tried switching to stand up work?
Also, what an easy win for a lot of companies, if productivity changes 10-20% plus on standing desks, what an incredible easy boost that is.

          <p>A few years ago I wrote an article about how to detect VR support with JavaScript. Since that time, a whole lot has changed. “Augmented reality” became a thing and terminology has moved to “XR”, instead of VR or AR. As such, the API has needed to evolve. The presence of navigator.xr signals that the […]

Work
At the end of 2021 I started a new job as Senior Front End Developer at Ada Mode, a data science and AI company working in the renewable energy sector. It’s been a great year for the company, as we’ve taken on a bunch of exciting projects and continued to make a name for ourselves. The year has been full of interesting challenges and learning opportunities for me personally, working with Vue and D3.js in particular, (and AWS, which has been less fun 😅) and it’s been a pleasure to work with the friendly and knowledgeable team. I’m looking forward to the company continuing to grow in 2023 as we hire new developers and begin projects spanning sustainable agriculture, wind energy, nuclear decommissioning, solar power an…</p>

          <p>Another year has come and gone. I can’t believe it. I think I’ll look back on 2022 as a year of milestones. It’s been a year of new jobs, new challenges, new products, and new hobbies. This is my second year piecing my year together from my monthly vibechecks. I think I’ve boiled those posts down to some major themes from the past year.
My new job at Luro

The biggest change this past year is my employment, I’m working full-time on Luro. What began as a side project app has grown into it’s own little stealth startup. And when I say startup, I mean startup. Over the course of the last year, we took a bit of pre-seed investment, made our first hires, re-architected the app, and onboarded our first round of private beta users.
There have been ups and downs starting a SaaS business in the head…</p>

          <p>let&#x27;s say I am using Tailwind CSS (licensed under MIT) in my website by using the npm package &quot;tailwindcss&quot; which on build creates a css file. According to MIT - &quot;The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.&quot;.
The css file that is created has a comment on top &quot;/* ! tailwindcss v3.0.23 | MIT License | https://tailwindcss.com */&quot;
Is that sufficient? or do I need to include the whole MIT text or do I need to make a /license page and write about it there &quot;tailwindcss is used in this website, licensed under MIT - full MIT license here&quot;? if not, how do I do it correctly?
I saw some sites like which seem to use tailwindcss but in the devtool sources only have the top line in the css &quot;tailwindcss v3.0.23 | MIT License | https://tailwindcss.com&quot; is that a violation of the MIT license?

          <p>Finally feeling like society around me has settled into it&#x27;s stride, even many normal things have happened, but as I write my last blog post of the year (as I&#x27;ve done for over a decade), I&#x27;m not entirely happy with how I feel like my blog has been neglected.
Work
Since the pandemic hit us back in early 2020, I&#x27;ve been working (mostly) flat out because we really didn&#x27;t know what would happen to the economy.
My typical work contract would be, at most, a few months, but instead I&#x27;ve been working very long term with clients. This is really good for our security but not something I&#x27;m used to and I can see the impact it&#x27;s had on my creativity around side projects that I&#x27;d normally work towards.
More obvious (to me) is my lack of blogging and really the motivation to write has gone utterly kaput.…</p>

We’ve gotten past detecting which browser the user is using, and we’re now into knowing what pieces of the browser UI users are seeing. Browsers provide window.personalbar, window.locationbar, and window.menubar properties, with the […]

          <a href=https://www.rssbrain.com/ target="_blank">Show HN: RSS Brain</a>
          <p>I wrote an RSS reader called RSS Brain recently. The motivate is the current RSS readers either don&#x27;t sort articles by priority, which makes it hard to read posts from HackerNews and Reddit, or sort it with some &quot;smart&quot; algorithm which I don&#x27;t trust. I also like the Google News feature that can show related story from different source, but the sources are not configurable and the algorithm is not transparent either. So with RSS Brain, I implemented these features:
* Recommend related articles from the feeds of your choice. It&#x27;s backed by ElasticSearch and the algorithm is described on RSS Brain&#x27;s website.
* Option to sort articles by upvotes and time. The algorithm is similar to the old Reddit and you can find it on the website as well.
* Save search terms into folders so you can filter the articles.
I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and found these features very helpful. So I want to share this on HackerNews. The frontend is written in Flutter so it has cross platform clients, even though the web version don&#x27;t feel very &quot;web native&quot; because the level of Flutter web support. I guess only time can improve that.
I don&#x27;t have enough hardware to scale it up so it&#x27;s currently in subscription mode to limit the users. I&#x27;m going to open source the code (maybe non-commercial license) once I think it&#x27;s ready so you can host it by yourself. It&#x27;s still in early stage and haven&#x27;t been tested by a lot of people. So any feedback is helpful. Thanks!
Update: Added a scroll down hint in the landing page. Thanks for the feedback.

          <p>I am making a feed reader that (i) would like to show you a significant amount of text in the feed and (ii) builds models to cluster and classify the text
In terms of length I like the abstracts of scientific papers on sites like arxiv.org.
I have more scientific papers now than I can stand, so I am looking for high volume RSS feeds of a huge paragraph or a few small paragraphs on any topics:  the subject could be sports or javascript programming, product reviews, any kind of journalism or other non-fiction.
Good length is the first qualification but to feed this beast I would love feeds that get 10, 20 or 50 articles a day.
Any suggestions?

          <p>When working on a “stretch project”, it’s tempting to keep your plans high level when getting review / sign off.  This sabotages feedback - the value of experience is in the details.
Write out specific plans and then seek out feedback from folks who’ve done work like it before.</p>

          <p>Space is one of the core elements in design that is often overlooked. Proper spatial organization helps to achieve consistency between screens, pages, or even products. It also creates visual rhythm, limits decision-making, and helps to achieve better readability and scannability. In this guide, Paul Matvienko discusses the basics of defining a spatial system.</p>

          <p>When it comes to animations on the web, developers need to measure the animation’s requirements with the right technology — CSS or JavaScript. Many animations are manageable with CSS but JavaScript will always provide more control. With document.getAnimations, however, you can use JavaScript to manage CSS animations! The document.getAnimations method returns an array of CSSAnimation […]

          <p>I just downloaded my Google &quot;MyActivity&quot; takeout html file (it&#x27;s a file of all your activity on Google and Chrome that you can download for yourself. It&#x27;s an HTML file).
It was multiple hundreds of MB in size.
I opened it in Notepad++ and searched for &quot;etymology&quot;. I&#x27;m an etymology junkie. And was amazed at how many word/phrase origins I had searched for that I couldn&#x27;t even remember searching for.
The problem was that it was very very slow. I didn&#x27;t expect Notepad++ to choke on such a large file, but it did. (It wouldn&#x27;t open in Chrome, it froze Chrome.)
Any thoughts on what app I should open it in if all I want to do is text search?

          <p>Quite a lot of us tech writers don’t get everything 100% right all of the time. Sometimes a small typo might elude us, sometimes we make the odd factual error despite our best efforts and research.

When a company promises to be carbon neutral by 2030, they’re actually saying that they may never be. That’s because almost all the pressures on them are short-term pressures.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34128451 target="_blank">How to Polish CSS?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;ve came to deep realization that CSS is the most important  thing for building a website. It holds the key to becoming full stack developer or just a backend developer. It&#x27;s everything in frontend.
Sooner or later, you&#x27;ll need vanilla css. You can&#x27;t depend on bootcrap or failwindcss. Your site looks like same if you do so. And many components aren&#x27;t available there.
There are components like carousel, cards hover etc etc..How to polish all these skills?
Is there a course for it?
I try to practice it like randomly, but there are no tutorials. I&#x27;m not at a phase where I can read complex long code and  decode it.

          <p>Firstly, I wish everyone a merry Christmas.
If you log onto Hacker News everyday, you&#x27;ll notice that a lot of changes have happened in the website.
For starters: the navigation bar&#x27;s color has changed to a slightly darker shade of red, rather than the orange background.
The top post numbers are now in alternating red and green colors (christmas colors).
I couldn&#x27;t have been the only one to notice, right? In the beginning I thought something was messed up - only to realize what day it was today.

          <p>I watched the documentary General Magic (mentioned in Tony Fadell’s book Build) about the 1990s Apple spin-off company General Magic that built the iPhone before the iPhone. Ultimately the product was a commercial failure, but the documentary is a wonderful look at product design and what happens when you let talented engineers roam free range. They invented USB, created capacitive touch screen GUIs, and imagined the portable “Post-PC” world before Windows 95 and the Internet were ever popular. Ultimately the product was a failure, too early for its time. How did they build this product? Well the answer is… prototypes.
My favorite part of the documentary is Megan Smith beaming over her cabinet full of hardware prototypes. Her focus on making something people love, an intimate device, is infectious. Her eagerness to blend everyone’s wishes with the harsh reality of available and affordable hardware shows. Starting with off-the-shelf components and inventing if necessary. When describing the product, she’s not talking about megabytes, protocols, and pixels, but talking about the sound, the feeling, the touch of the product and software in people’s hands.
I feel more vindicated than ever that prototypes, put in people’s hands, are the biggest opportunity to capture lightning in a bottle. These people are imagining and building the iPhone 17 years before the iPhone launched. Megan Smith talks like Steve Jobs, but Steve Jobs doesn’t work at Apple or General Magic. We often herald the invention of the iPhone or Android and these magic devices as invented out of thin air or our collective science fiction, but both of those products used by billions of people rose from the ashes of General Magic’s failure. That’s a lot to dwell on. The composting of failures produces rich and fertile soil.</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34116679 target="_blank">Tough time building components of a site using vanilla CSS. What to do?</a>
          <p>By now, I&#x27;m done with basics html,css,bootstrap coding. I can build navbar, build a hero section with image and h1 text and a footer. That&#x27;s all.
There are various components in a website though. I&#x27;d like to be able to build any of them whenever required if I&#x27;m in a job.
I wanted to build a timeline using html and css but it&#x27;s not entering my head at all. I&#x27;ve seen codes from multiple websites.
https://imgur.com/a/L7c1Bkj
This is the timeline that I want to build. Looks pretty simple but I&#x27;m unable to build it. How do I deal with stuffs like this? How do I learn these stuffs?
Is there a course that helps to deal with these stuffs? There&#x27;s no point of having learn CSS if I can&#x27;t build these stuffs with my visualization. Please guide me.
The scary thing here is that if I can&#x27;t build these stuffs then there is 0 point of me learning css. And I&#x27;m not going to get any full stack or frontend jobs like that way.

          <p>It’s a Christmas miracle—Bootstrap v5.3.0-alpha1 has arrived just in time for the holiday break! This release brings new color mode support, an expanded color palette with variables and utilities, and more.
We’re keeping things short and simple in this blog post with deeper dives into the new color modes and more coming in future posts. For now, we want you to enjoy the holiday break and come back next year feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. Keep reading for what’s new and we’ll see you next year!
Dark mode and color modes


Bootstrap now supports an explicit opt-in for creating multiple color modes via the data-bs-theme attribute on the root 
 element. We opted for a data attribute solution so that you can create any number of themes instead of just light and dark. We use a new Sass …</p>

          <p>MailChimp used to send out a client&#x27;s newsletters from RSS feed without issue. A few weeks ago, they started showing up a day later. After weeks of trying to get support to track down this bug, we finally got this response
&quot;Thank you for your patience while my team looks at this. We were able to confirm that the best time range currently to space the blog posts is 10-12 hours before Mailchimp&#x27;s sending time. There just isn&#x27;t enough time between your posts and the feed to pull the new content.
As a best practice, I would plan your content releases a day in advance with this functionality in mind.&quot;
It started with 4 hours, now they are telling us 10-12 hours in advance? My client runs a news site and sends our daily news. It&#x27;s not always possible to even publish content that far in advance. It&#x27;s insane to me that this functionality was working fine, for years. That they have managed to break and instead of fixing are saying just publish an insane amount of time ahead of the newsletter being sent?
I&#x27;m not sure what it takes to get someone&#x27;s attention at MailChimp to actually fix this. Read the RSS feed before sending the scheduled post. Like it used to. Otherwise, what newsletter providers would people recommend replacing MailChimp with?

To help raise your awareness of their possibilities, Nicolas Hoffmann shares his experience of how he and his team at Proton carried out a massive move from CSS logical props to production and how you can consider them from a different perspective in your very own projects.</p>

          <p>We&#x27;re happy to announce the availability of a new feature: HTML Diffs. When you run a test now and you check &quot;Save Response Bodies&quot;, a new option shows up in the drop down of results pages called HTML Diff. Example result.
It shows what changed between the page&#x27;s HTML as sent by the server over the network and the HTML that the browser finally used to render the page when the test was complete. The most common reasons for there being a difference is
generated content - dynamic content inserted into the DOM by JavaScript (think a React app for example)
the browser &quot;correcting&quot; your HTML
Features
You have the option to prettify the HTML before the diff is run, which often helps readability, for example for minified content or otherwise long lines.

          <p>When a car is switching gears, the engine is providing no forward power. And it’s more difficult to steer, brake or otherwise control the forward motion of the car as you change it from one gear ratio to another.

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/early-stable/ target="_blank">Change in release schedule from Chrome 110</a>
          <p>We are making a change to the release schedule for Chrome. From Chrome 110, the initial release date to stable will be one week earlier. This early stable version will be released to a small percentage of users, with the majority of people getting the release a week later at the normal scheduled date, this will also be the date the new version is available from the Chrome download page.
For Chrome 110 the key dates will be:
Beta: January 12, 2023
Early Stable: February 1, 2023
Stable: February 7, 2023
You can keep track of upcoming release dates and included features on the Chrome Status Roadmap, and on the Chromium Dashboard. The beta posts have more details of features, and any deprecations and removals for each release.
# Why are we making this change?
By releasing stable to a small percentage of users early, we get a chance to monitor the release before it rolls out to all of our users. If any showstopping issue is discovered, it can be addressed while the impact is relatively small.
For most developers this change will have little impact. Keep following this blog for up to date information on features and any upcoming deprecations and removals. We aim to bring you any relevant information in good time for you to act upon it, before any change in Chrome.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34037748 target="_blank">Ask HN: How can I design a generic library that provides its own endpoints?</a>
          <p>I like how ActivityPub can be implemented on any website and provide a good set of endpoints to enable rich, social-media-like content interactions. I&#x27;d love to enable my current website to respond to those requests, but I don&#x27;t want to either use &quot;activitypub-express&quot; or install a full Mastodon (or any other) server just for myself.
My idea was to implement the protocol myself, which would be a nice way to learn it and its problems. But I would also love to make it a library that can be applied by others on their own, already existing websites.
The problem that I am having is that the current methods to implement this kind of pluggable extension involve connecting to one specific back end framework, such as creating an Express middleware.
What I was thinking was:
- Use TypeScript (to leverage the large JS community)
- Make it as vanilla as possible
- Use fetch standards such as the Request and Response objects, which are available natively since Node 18
- Provide multiple adapters for common frameworks such as Express, Fastify, Next.js, Astro, etc
Is this solved elegantly on any other language or framework?

I’ve pulled the name of the newsletter I ran last year (Herding Lions) into the blog – this is now Herding Lions and I’ll be putting all my eng leadership content here in addition to the other content I’ve historically covered here.
I’m adding a micro blog for shorter posts / to have a central controlled place for my short term content while Twitter meltdowns and everybody sorts out what’s coming next in that space.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34014642 target="_blank">Ask HN: What is the successor to HTML Applications (.hta)?</a>
          <p>Back in the day (late 90s), Microsoft had a format called &quot;HTML Application.&quot;
It was just an HTML page with a &quot;.hta&quot; file extension. Opening such a file would open it in a chrome-less browser, and give the scripting in the page access to the file system.
I used to love these things. I wrote a bunch of little apps in them.
Some examples:
https://medium.com/@anht_59851/html-application-hta-a-gui-for-your-scripting-on-windows-bfaacf2c3bdd
These still exist, but there are problems with them:
1. Coding is a bear. They run in the mshta.exe process, and that spawns an instance of... IE9, I think? There&#x27;s no &quot;inspect&quot; panel, for instance, and errors just pop a modal with no debugging information.
2. Near as I can tell, they use an older version of ECMAScript. &quot;let&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to work, not does &quot;addEventListener,&quot; etc. I kept getting weird &quot;Syntax Errors&quot; for things that appeared to be valid, contemporary JavaScript.
3. I&#x27;m quite sure some security software (like on my laptop, issued by employer), blocks these from executing.
What&#x27;s the current-day equivalent of these?  I want to write an HTML page complete with CSS and JS, double-click on it from my desktop, have it open in a browser instance of its own, and have access to the file system.
I essentially want a way to create little GUI apps, without having to use WinForms.
What am I looking for? Is it Electron?
(Note: I&#x27;m on Windows)

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/help-css-nesting-again/ target="_blank">Help choose the syntax for CSS Nesting</a>
          <p>After we ran the previous survey to help choose the syntax for CSS Nesting, the CSS Working Group continued debate over the best way to define nesting in CSS. During the discussions new syntax ideas were suggested. To help the Working Group choose between any of these syntaxes, there is a new survey.
# The Options
Based on the results of the previous survey, options one and two are no longer being considered. Two new options (four and five) have been added.
# Option 5: Top-level nesting container
Introduces a top-level @nest rule that contains a &amp; { … } block with declarations and multiple nested style rules.
@nest selector {
  &amp; {
    property: value;
  }
  nested-selector {
    property: value;
  }
}
# Option 4: Postfix proposal
An extra code block containing the nested rules is inserted after main rule which contains the declarations.
selector {
  property: value;
} {
  nested-selector {
    property: value;
  }
}
# Option 3: Non-letter start proposal
Every nested rule to be unambiguous on its own, by requiring it to start with a non-symbol. You can write &amp; div or :is(div) if you need to start a selector with a type selector.
selector {
  property: value;
  &amp; nested-selector {
    property: value;
  }
}
While the snippets above are only used to demonstrate the basics of each proposal, there are many more examples included along with the new survey.

          <p>I made a chrome extension to extract styles from elements on a webpage. Its surprisingly hard to do without access to chrome debugger API in manifest V3. It doesn&#x27;t work for every site and I’m still improving it. A particular sore spot is with media queries but I&#x27;m working on a solution.
Any feedback is appreciated.

          <a href=https://css-irl.info/logical-border-radius/ target="_blank">Logical Border Radius</a>
          <p>Confession: I almost never write border-radius as shorthand, largely because I can never remember the order. My brain is wired to remember margin and padding shorthands (top, right, bottom, left), but when it comes to corners it’s a different story. Do I start from the top left corner, or the top right? So I usually resort to the longhand, which is admittedly verbose, but at least has the advantage of being explicit, for me and any future readers of my code. For the record, these are equivalent:
div {
  border-radius: 10% 20% 30% 75%;
}
div {
  border-top-left-radius: 10%;
  border-top-right-radius: 20%;
  border-bottom-right-radius: 30%;
  border-bottom-left-radius: 75%;
}
In the shorthand, we start from the top left corner, and go round clockwise, ending with the bottom left.

I couldn&#x27;t think of a better person to talk about this than Parisa Tabriz, our VP of Engineering and Product. Parisa took the reins of our work on both the browser and the open web platform, earlier this year. I hope you enjoy this interview as much as I did.

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/cws-policy-revamp-jan23/ target="_blank">Chrome Web Store Policy Updates</a>
          <p>We are announcing a set of policy updates designed to encourage the development
of high quality products, prevent deceptive behavior, and ensure informed user
consent. These updates include:
Minimum Functionality Policy Update
—Expands our current Minimum Functionality Policy to include
click-baity template extensions, empty extensions, and extensions that do not
directly provide their stated functionality.
Misleading and Deceptive Behavior Policy Update
—Prohibits anti-virus, privacy, and security extensions that provide no
discernible protection or monitoring.
Affiliate Ads Policy
—Establishes new disclosure requirements for extensions that include
affiliate ad programs. Developers will now be required to disclose any
affiliate programs to users before installation. Additionally, related user
action is required before the inclusion of affiliate codes, links, or
cookies.
Developers can also learn more about today&#x27;s guidance in our Program Policies.
These policy clarifications will go into effect on January 15, 2023. After that
date, extensions in violation of these new policies may be removed from the
Chrome Web Store and be disabled.
If you have any questions, you can contact developer support.
Thank you for your cooperation, and for your participation in the Chrome
extension ecosystem!

          <p>WebPageTest has supported Google&#x27;s Lighthouse as part of our test suite for a while now, and there are a number of great reasons to choose to run Lighthouse on WebPageTest (accurate packet-level throttling, clean test environment with careful configuration to ensure accuracy and repeatability, always the latest version, etc. etc.)
That said, we&#x27;ve long felt that there were opportunities to make better use of Lighthouse results alongside WebPageTest&#x27;s broader test analysis. Today, we took the first steps towards that goal with a new Lighthouse result page that has a number of unique features we think you&#x27;ll find very useful.
A New Lighthouse Result Page
As of today, WebPageTest&#x27;s Lighthouse results will now be displayed like other first-party test result pages on WebPageTest:

          <p>It was always “Oh, you’re only at risk of automation if your job has a high degree of repetition, creative jobs are less at risk” but it feels like over the course of the past year Copilot, Dall-e, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and ChatGPT have decided upend that assumption. Writing, code, art… all with computers nipping at the heels with competency and speed. Fascinating. Unexpected in my lifetime. A mild bit alarming, but fascinating nonetheless.
I don’t think it’s all bad, but my brain is still ramping up to the new reality that these handicrafts have (likely) been permanently altered. We should celebrate the lower bar for creative endeavors; you no longer need to be an expert at Photoshop to produce a creative image, just an expert at generating prompts. People are extracting beautiful artifacts from these machines. Incredible.
As interesting a future this creates, I’m a member of an old caste of people that still believes massive gains don’t come without realized costs; or more explicitly, electricity isn’t the only cost. What if the cost we’re paying is our perception of reality itself? It’s increasingly likely that the next thing you read or watch is the product of a content extruder. Your favorite author, artist, creator, influencer, job applicant, or manager; the curtain pulled back to reveal a series of six word prompts. Rather than be left behind, I should start the augmentation process now…

          <p>Wanted to check out Golang so built a simple local RSS Digest reader, using any markdown reader as its GUI. I&#x27;ve been using it for the last 4 months and I am quite content with it, especially since my markdown files are synced on all devices, I can consume my daily brew from anywhere and anytime without any FOMO.
Features:
- RSS Digest: show only previously un-generated articles
- Interested Topics/Keywords (through Google News)
- Daily Weather
- Bookmark to Instapaper
- Show hot articles / comments link for Hacker News posts
Upcoming Features:
- Terminal mode
- Quote of the day (from r/quotes)
- Perhaps a daily calendar, to show today&#x27;s meeting 
- Accessing non-rss feeds (Twitter)
- Configurable for Weekly digest instead of Daily
Any feedback/idea is welcome :)

Something like this:
    Comment by Blah:
    The best is to use a template literal.
    
        Reply by Foo:
        I disagree, you should use str.replace and ignore
        template literals.
    
            Reply by Blah:
            Respectfully, you are an idiot. Ignoring template literals
            for a horrible regex has no place in JavaScript.
    
        Reply by wattle:
        I agree, and here&#x27;s a tangent that doesn&#x27;t have
        much to do with the topic.

Is it possible to style HN like that?

Basically let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m using Tailwind with React, and I frequently use the pattern:

Is there any tool out there that will analyze a project&#x27;s source and look for these patterns, and suggestions for creation of components out of them? I could have sworn I saw this as a VSCode Extension or something at one point.

          <p>I just want to focus on content. I want a minimal, fast, legible page that is built from Markdown.
I’ve tried four or five times now. Dozens of hours wasted learning frameworks and testing out themes and designs.
I don’t have thousands of dollars for a designer to come save me. So I’m feeling frustrated and lost at how to get something that’s serviceable so I can move on to the content.
Every blog I see linked on this website seems so nice in comparison!
For reference, my current attempt. I hate it. https://todays.pointless.click/

          <p>As a UX professional in today’s data-driven landscape, it’s increasingly likely that you’ve been asked to design a personalized digital experience, whether it’s a public website, user portal, or native application. Yet while there continues to be no shortage of marketing hype around personalization platforms, we still have very few standardized approaches for implementing personalized UX.
That’s where we come in. After completing dozens of personalization projects over the past few years, we gave ourselves a goal: could you create a holistic personalization framework specifically for UX practitioners? The Personalization Pyramid is a designer-centric model for standing up human-centered personalization programs, spanning data, segmentation, content delivery, and overall goals. By using thi…</p>

          <p>Chrome 108 introduced two new modes, Memory Saver and Energy Saver, to give users more control over how Chrome utilizes their system resources.
While these new modes are primarily user-facing, they do have some implications that are important for web developers to be aware of, as they can potentially impact the user experience of your site.
This post will cover the potential effects of these new modes and what web developers can do to ensure they&#x27;re delivering the best experience possible.
# Memory Saver mode
When Memory Saver mode is enabled, Chrome will proactively discard tabs that have been unused in the background for some time. This frees up memory for active tabs as well as other applications that may be running. Users can instruct Chrome not to discard tabs for specific sites; howe…</p>

          <a href=https://app.depoxy.dev/login/ target="_blank">Show HN: Depoxy – DataOps UI for the AWS data stack</a>
          <p>Hi HN,
During this year we have been building Depoxy, a tool for managing and optimizing data pipelines on AWS.
The main reasons for building Depoxy are:
the current UIs for managing data pipelines are inefficient
optimizing data pipelines has a lot of potential both in CO2 and financial terms
Where is this inefficiency coming from and how much better we can get?
The UI and the tooling around data services are not integrated at the level it is optimal. This is the reason why having an integrated UI improves the workflows by 50% (22s vs 54s). You can check out the video we have about a simple workflow.
How much optimization?
We have 10 years experience with various clients in this space and based on the previous experiences the optimization potential is between 10 - 30% year over year infrastructure cost. This is a lot for many companies, especially nowadays.
Where are we with this product?
This is the first iteration of the product and we just got started. The next iteration is going to be metadata analytics engine for data that is stored on AWS S3. Based on the metadata we can get insight into the efficiency of the data set and provide guidance for optimizing it.
The second next iteration we are planning to implement a SQL parsing engine that provides automatic data lineage so that people can track how data flows through their system.
Detailed blog post with a lot more:

          <p>Hey,
Will you recognize what the icons in the following link want to explain? I thought it’s a good quiz to ask my international friends here to find out how well these icons work. Now think about using only icons for an interface again. The idea of building these icons is to reduce friction in the user interface and to clean up endless text options but what is it worth if no one knows what the symbol really means? I myself struggle a lot when apps have text links for everything but the user login / registration or account link is a symbol that’s hard to identify (is it the login, the sign up, the logout icon?).

As the world increasingly becomes more connected, companies look for ways to tap into new markets and expand their customer base. One way they’re doing this is by becoming more diverse in their workforce. There are many benefits to having a workforce representing different cultures and backgrounds. It can also lead to more creativity and innovative thinking, as employees with different perspectives can bring new ideas to the table.
Remote work has become more prevalent in recent years, allowing employees to work from anywhere in the world. This gives companies access to a larger …</p>

I remember finding (and subsequently losing the link to) a website a few months ago which outlined a process for requirements gathering and description based around an initiating event and the data transformations that should take place in response to it. All google searches I can think of lead to many articles about event driven software patterns. Hoping someone here knows what I&#x27;m referring to!
