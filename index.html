Chromium issue: 1178508

          <p>In the course of my work I sometimes find myself needing to mock API requests — often when I’m prototyping, or testing a concept for an article. There are a couple of useful (free) tools I reach for on these occasions.
n:point
n:point provides lightweight, publicly accessible API endpoints for your JSON data. It’s super easy to use: simply give it some JSON and it sets up an endpoint in seconds. No messing about with access tokens, it’s ideal if you just want to fetch some data. You can also define and lock the JSON schema. I’m using n:point for a Codrops article on creating an interactive line graph based on timeseries data.
Mockeroo
If you need to actually generate some data, Mockeroo is a tool that enables you to do just that. You can add rows of different types and Mockeroo will generate random data. There are configuration options, including setting ranges (for numbers and dates, for example), and including null values. If you’re happy writing Ruby, you can also include formulas and you can download the data in different formats.
I’ve only used Mockeroo for generating JSON, but you can also create API endpoints. It’s not as quick as n:point to set up, but looks useful if you need to mock any more complex API requests.</p>

          <p>The
origin private file system
provides access to a special kind of file that is highly optimized for performance, for example, by
offering in-place and exclusive write access to a file&#x27;s content. Developers can get access to such
files by calling
createSyncAccessHandle(),
which is a method exposed on
FileSystemFileHandle objects. This call
results in a FileSystemSyncAccessHandle.
The createSyncAccessHandle() method and therefore FileSystemSyncAccessHandle is only
exposed in Workers. It is not available in the main thread. 


FileSystemSyncAccessHandle is a file primitive that provides performant access to local files. One
of its main use cases is applications porting C/C++ code to Wasm; however, asynchronous calls are
not fully supported on Wasm yet, and using the
Asyncify library as an a…</p>

There are new properties in the Screen Capture API to improve the screen sharing experiences.
You can now precisely identify whether a resource on your page is render blocking or not.
There is a new way to send data to a backend server with the declarative PendingBeacon API in origin trial. And there’s plenty more.
And there&#x27;s plenty more.
I&#x27;m Adriana Jara. Let&#x27;s dive in and
see what&#x27;s new for developers in Chrome 107.
# New properties in Screen Capture API
In this version the Screen Capture API adds new properties to improve the screen sharing experiences.
The DisplayMediaStreamConstraints added the selfBrowserSurface property. With this hint the application can tell the browser that when calling getDisplayMedia() the current tab should be excluded.

          <p>This week, no sooner than October 26, we will begin increasing the Privacy
Sandbox Relevance and Measurement origin trial population towards 5% of Chrome
Stable users. We always take an incremental approach to increasing limits and
actively monitor for issues in Chrome origin trials–you can expect to see
traffic levels increase over a period of a few days. Pre-stable channels, Canary
and Beta will continue as is with a 50/50 split for origin trial eligibility.
We brought the trial to Chrome Stable in
August to enable functional testing
in a real, production environment—and the results helped us improve API
stability, developer documentation, and support. We are increasing the scale of
this testing to 5% to continue functional testing through 2022 and prepare for
utility testing in 2023.

We are on the path towards phasing out third-party cookies across the web
platform. That&#x27;s a major milestone in tackling cross-site tracking, but it&#x27;s
part of a pretty long journey. Let&#x27;s take a peek at how far we&#x27;ve come and what
treats are in store in the future…
On the surface, cookies provide a simple key-value store that&#x27;s sent between the
browser and the server. That can provide useful functionality on a site such as
saving a preference: theme&#x3D;bats or storing the session ID for a signed in
user.
If that cookie is being used on the same site that set it, then we tend to call
that a first-party cookie. If it&#x27;s being used as part of a different site than

          <p>Hi HN,
I am trying to find an article I read, possibly posted on HN, about how mobile operating systems are becoming/could become the de facto unified messaging interface across multiple instant messaging apps due to the ubiquity of push notifications and the prevalence of contacts on share sheets.
As I recall, it was primary a UI/UX-focused article.
Unfortunately after an hour of trying various search combinations I have not come up with anything. I&#x27;m pretty sure it was an article published after 2019.
Hopefully someone remembers this and can share the link with me in the comments.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;33294641 target="_blank">Ask HN: Help finding good embedded DSP design resources?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;m working on an LED art project that combines a few realtime signals; audio and some other inputs to inform the visuals. I&#x27;m running things on an ESP32 right now and doing an FFT and some other sort of seat-of-the-pants DSP stuff on one core while the other handles bluetooth, LED control, etc. I&#x27;ve got some time to mess around and I&#x27;d like to get a broad strokes overview of the embedded DSP field to inform myself on where to explore next. I&#x27;ve got a fair bit of hands on experience but little formal training.
Ultimately the goal is to *make good art* so I&#x27;m not really looking for anything specific. In my head I&#x27;ll get some good papers/textbooks/libraries/articles recommended to me and then I&#x27;ll spend a few weeks to write toy implementations of whatever seems interesting in C to get a feel for the space.
I&#x27;m particularly looking for the nitty-gritty type stuff, cool hacks that save cycles and improve latency, my goal here is visceral reactivity and I&#x27;d like to get some more tools in my toolkit that allow me to interpret and combine signals in realtime in interesting ways. Even info on cool math hacks like Carmack&#x27;s fast inverse square root would be appreciated.
P.S. Also of interest is material on debugging and modelling realtime code.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;33299225 target="_blank">Background-position: 50% 50% confusions in CSS?</a>
          <p>This is my background image.
I set:
    background-position:50% 50%;
I get this as my output:
But I don’t understand the output.
So, I read little bit about background-position again.
&gt;A value such as 20% 65% specifies that the point 20% across and 65% down the image be placed at the point 20% across and 65% down the element.
https://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/css/color-background/background-position.html
&gt;With a value pair of &#x27;14% 84%&#x27;, the point 14% across and 84% down the image is to be placed at the point 14% across and 84% down the padding area.
https://wiki.cdot.senecacollege.ca/wiki/CSS_GUIDE_BACKGROUND_POSITION
&gt;A horizontal value of 25% positions the point 25% from the left edge of the image at a point that is 25% from the left edge of the background positioning area.
“Learning web design” by Jenniver Nierdest Robbins
If I wanted to put the background image at the center using the “percentage percentage”, how’d I do it? (50% 0% doesn’t work).
Sadly, I still don’t get it.
My HTML Code:
    
    
Document
        

My CSS code:
    body{
        background-color:yellowgreen;
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        background-image: url(../images/circle.png);
        background-position:50% 0%;
       
    }

          <p>I recently started using AWS for my new job, and am currently stuck with CloudWatch for logs. I used to dislike Graylog because of the clunky interface, but I just cannot extract anything from CloudWatch! My logs are there, I can view them but it&#x27;s impossible to query them:
- on the Log Streams page, the pagination doesn&#x27;t work, I can only view page 1
- if I do &quot;Search all streams&quot; with a basic filter (something like &#x60;foo &#x3D; &quot;bar&quot;&#x60;) it doesn&#x27;t return anything (I know there are some matches I can see them)
- Logs Insights is limited to the last 3 hours of logs
Is there an alternative CloudWatch interface somewhere that would allow me to finally query my logs? I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s a CLI, a heavy client or a webpage, I just want to query my logs...

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;33275657 target="_blank">What&#x27;s the difference between CSS “em” and “rem”?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;ve read this much about this:
1) Learning Web Design
Book by Jennifer Niederst Robbins
1 rem&#x3D; 1* browser&#x27;s default font size
1 em&#x3D; depends on the element type, for h1 it&#x27;s something, for h2, it&#x27;s sth else.
2) https://css-tricks.com/confused-rem-em/
&gt;While em is relative to the font-size of its direct or nearest parent, rem is only relative to the html (root) font-size.
I get the rem part, but not the em part. What does it mean?
3) https://blog.logrocket.com/using-em-vs-rem-css/#:~:text&#x3D;Let%27s%20get%20started!-,What%20are%20em%20and%20rem%20and%20why%20use%20them%3F,relative%20to%20a%20set%20value.
I&#x27;ve read this as well but since I&#x27;m only knowing html and starting to learn css, I could not get most of the things written there.
4) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;tlRLEsZa89M
I watch this short video. It does makes things somewhat clear about &quot;inherits from parent&quot;.
Anyway, I am eager to learn the crux of &quot;em&quot;. Maybe with some code examples, or figures(if it&#x27;s lying anywhere in internet)

          <p>It’s been some years since Tab Atkins-Bittner first proposed Cascading Attribute Sheets. I had a situation come up which made me think about them again and I thought I’d share.
On my site I have a handful of blog posts which have a title and/or text content in different languages. As someone who speaks a handful of languages, I like incorporating different languages, phrases, and untranslatable words into my day-to-day blogging. 「手答え」(tegotae) is an example of one of those words. It directly translates to “hand response” but is sometimes translated as “haptic feedback” or “game feel” when used in a video game context.
One problem with my use of other languages is that I’m lacking proper lang attributes on the foreign text, which makes it inaccessible. I’ve started brainstorming ways out of…</p>

          <p>Working on a web extension is an interesting experience — you get to taste web while working with special extension APIs. One such API is storage — the web extension flavor of persistence. Let’s explore how you can use session and local storage within your Manifest V3 web extensions!

          <a href=https://daverupert.com/2022/10/200000-dollar-guitar/ target="_blank">Can you hear the difference between a $200, $2,000, $20,000, and $200,000 guitar?</a>
          <p>The YouTube gods surfaced me a video of classical guitarist Brandon Acker comparing a $200 guitar, a $2,000 guitar, a $20,000 guitar, and a $200,000 guitar. As you step up in orders of magnitude in cost, you start to see what creates value: the materials, the resonance, the sustain, the ease of playability. I’ve played guitar all my life and I never even imagined $200,000 guitars existed. I won’t spoil which one is the best but the result is shocking! Every guitarist I’ve talked to that’s seen this video had the same reaction.
tl;dr- I would love to see someone do this with websites.
Bonus: Building a classical guitar from scratch

If you want a behind the scenes look at what goes into making a $20,000 guitar, musician and YouTuber Rob Scallon spends a week+ building a classical guitar with the same classical guitar luthier from the previous video,  Marshall Bruné. It’s a two hour video and I gobbled up every minute. Planks of wood and chunks of bone transformed through bending, shaving, sanding, gluing, and polishing; a transfiguration into a masterpiece. Incredible.
As mentioned in other carpentry videos I’ve watched, I love the little glimpses into the bespoke tools experts create to do their job well; the benders, the shapers, the hole cutters. The processes too! The fretboards are aged a minimum of seven years in a humidity controlled environment! How would you even know to do that without centuries of institutional knowledge? It’s interesting to see where these masters of their craft draw the line on what to do bespoke (the body) and where to leverage prefabrication and modern machinery (the neck).

          <p>Hi HN,
I&#x27;ve recently gone through a few interviews where I did poorly on system design questions like &quot;design twitter.&quot; The interviewers expressed a wish to see me go more in depth on technologies, but I simply don&#x27;t have much experience in any of them, as my current role is heavily ML focused and issues of scaling were long-ago solved by my large employer.
My question is are there any recommendations for ways to get more experience on system design? For most things it&#x27;d be as simple as &quot;start a project revolving around X&quot; but for scaling.. you kind of need users first. Was wondering how to get around this problem.
Thanks

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/rename-trust-tokens/ target="_blank">Trust Tokens renamed Private State Tokens</a>
          <p>The origin trial for Private State Tokens (previously known as Trust Tokens) is now closed.
API status updates will be provided on this page and on Chrome Platform Status.
# Name change
What you may have seen described as Trust Tokens will now be referred to as Private State Tokens.
Private State Tokens enable trust in a user&#x27;s authenticity to be conveyed from one context to another, to help sites combat fraud and distinguish bots from real humans without passive tracking.
# Why do we need this renaming?
The name &quot;Trust Token API&quot; was originally chosen to indicate that by using the API, websites could issue tokens to demonstrate their level of trust in the user. The tokens could then be redeemed for activity on other websites. Since then, we&#x27;ve received feedback that the name led to a misunderstanding that the API provided a signal of trust determined by the browser. The word &quot;trust&quot; has different meanings for different sites, and the website issuing the token determines the signal of trust.
We&#x27;re renaming the Trust Token API to Private State Token API to better showcase its privacy and utility benefits.
The API provides a small amount of storage to allow organizations to convey information from one context (token issuance) to another (token redemption)  in a privacy-preserving manner. The tokens are designed to help protect the user&#x27;s identity by using techniques such as cryptographic  blind signatures.
# Engage and share feedback
Demo: The Trust Tokens origin trial has closed, so the demo won&#x27;t work, but you can still view code for trust token issuance and redemption.

&quot;Our end goal is to unify these things. One styling solution, one theming solution, one set of utilities, one set of component authoring patterns, one set of components, one documentation site.&quot;
Is it mature? Worth to invest time and follow in coming years?

          <a href=https://adamsilver.io/blog/designing-a-time-input/ target="_blank">Designing a time input</a>
          <p>Entering a time is challenging because:
a time is made up of hours, minutes and a period (AM or PM)
there are many different formats for the same time like ‘12am’ ‘24:00’, 12.00am’, ‘12a.m.’ and ‘00’
Here I’ll explain why I recommend using a single text input for time.
But first, I’ll explain how to avoid the complexity of entering time in the first place.
# How to avoid making users enter a time
When it comes to forms, whenever we can help users avoid having to fill them out in the first place, we should.
When it comes to time there are certain ways to do that.
For example, I’m working on a service that has a closing time field for a job advert.
We could avoid making users enter a time by automatically setting the closing time to 11:59pm.

          <p>I am new to embedded PCB design. I can find lots of resources such as video tutorial or the schematics for the power, adc, dac, etc.
But I cannot find any hands-on tutorial on SDRAM, neither software nor hardware connection. I don&#x27;t know what those pins on SDRAM are for and how can I connect them to the MCU.
Is there any book about this topic?

Add a custom search engine in Chrome and you got yourself a quick shortcut to opening any repo in github dev. In the past I would clone repo then open with vs code to monkey around. Now its CMD+L , &#x27;gd expo/expo&#x27; to open https://github.dev/expo/expo/

          <p>I like to write articles about technology or to create tutorials.
I&#x27;m starting to feel the need to know how to structure them visually in a way that makes the right information standout. Sorry, if this is not very clear.
For example, I find that just using headings is not enough for this.
Does anyone have any reading resources about how to use design to improve readability? I think that&#x27;s basically what I need.

          <p>Hi HN!
Here&#x27;s what I am searching for, but haven&#x27;t found yet: a website that offers the releases of software as RSS feeds.
I imagine that after logging in, you can search and select software products (from Github, from Gitlab, or even proprietary,...). You then get one RSS feed which combines all releases into one stream.
Creating multiple streams that combine by topic, programming language or whatever would be great too.
Does something like this exist? Or something similar? I know that Github offers feeds for single projects, but it feels tedious to add like 50+ single feeds to the reader.
Thanks for any tips!

          <p>Which companies hire for hybrid Developer/Designer roles? 
I feel that sometimes that&#x27;s a really fulfilling role for some people (like me) and wondering where I could be paid for that (most jobs are either or one of the two positions).
Furthermore: has anybody worked in a similar role in a tech company and can share their experience?
Companies I&#x27;m aware already:
- Basecamp (designers owning the styling part of the FE)
- Ashby (recently saw some open positions about it but not exactly sure how it works there)
Thanks

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;33197429 target="_blank">Why is it so difficult to design digital baseband (e.g., LTE) chips?</a>
          <p>The LTE digital baseband market was famously dominated by Qualcomm, which maintained a 60+% market share for nearly a decade (2009-2019).  MediaTek also successfully entered the market, but not for high end phones for high-income markets (U.S., Europe, etc.). Famously, both Intel and Broadcom (two semiconductor firms known for their ability to design successful chips in other markets, e.g., MPUs, cable modem chips, WiFi chips, Bluetooth chips, etc.) attempted to enter the market and failed. Broadcom exited the market and wound down their LTE business unit. Intel sold its group to Apple, which now has gone on to fail to develop a 5g digital baseband solution (Apple continues to use Qualcomm for its 5g digital baseband solution).
Why (from an engineering perspective) is it so difficult to develop an advanced  LTE (or 5G) digital baseband chip such that even semiconductor powerhouses like Intel and Broadcom have struggled to develop solutions which compare to Qualcomm&#x27;s offerings?
Note - answers from semiconductor design engineers appreciated :)

          <p>Without a doubt, the world has become more connected, noisier and more complex. But along the way, we’re still applying our instincts from a century ago, from a planet of villages and different expectations. Rhetorical questions worth considering as we think about what’s normal.

Eleventy is a static site generator created by Zach Leatherman who came to this TKYT session to give me a beginner&#x27;s crash course on building static sites with Eleventy.
For folks more experienced with Eleventy, skip to the WebC portion that begins at almost exactly 1:00:00!</p>

          <p>We&#x27;re building an app that helps people manage their schedules, tasks, and notes all in one place.
The goal is to create a personal workspace where people can manage their days and weeks on a single screen, set their personal and professional priorities, access a single schedule combined of all their calendars, and navigate through their days without switching between multiple apps.
At the moment, we&#x27;ve implemented bi-directional Google calendar synchronisation, various types of tasks (e.g. daily, weekly, &quot;until done&quot;),  and basic note-taking functionality.
Also, Emery has some things we really wanted to see in other apps – private notes for meetings, group editing of overdue tasks, categories that can be used to group tasks/notes/meetings together, and weekly productivity reports.
Currently, it&#x27;s a web app for desktop. A standalone desktop app is coming soon.
Happy to hear any feedback and answer any questions!

          <p>Meta just unveiled their new Quest Pro headset. I am curious whether any of you are actually using AR/VR-Headsets on a regular basis for productive tasks.
Please share your use-case and how switching to this platform did (or perhaps didn&#x27;t) improve your productivity and overall work experience.

          <p>This is not for &#x27;deep&#x27; or &#x27;slow&#x27; reading with intention and focus. The idea is that you have a large pool of incoming stories and you aren&#x27;t interested in &#x27;reading&#x27; all of them, but you want to reduce the chance of missing a single story. You want to &#x27;screen&#x27; all stories.
This UI explores a &#x27;mark-and-clear&#x27; idiom; you mark a group of stories as &#x27;read&#x27; and then you clear that group, purging the stories from your view completely.

          <p>Interested in helping improve DevTools? Sign up to participate in Google User Research here.

 
Let’s admit it, writing automated tests is not the most fun thing in a developer’s life. As developers, we want to write features, fix bugs, and improve the world! However, when we don’t have automated testing in our workflows, in the long term, things can get quite “buggy”. So, we also think that writing automated tests is important.
With the Recorder panel in Chrome DevTools, you can record and replay user flows, export them to various formats (for example, test scripts) through different third-party extensions and libraries, customize the user flows with Puppeteer Replay library, and integrate them with your existing workflows.
In this blog post, we’re going to discuss:

          <p>The Chrome team has been working hard to build new capabilities, though we&#x27;re
responsible for only a small fraction of the work. Web app developers depend
on countless others in the community to build a strong ecosystem of APIs, tools,
demonstration apps, and other materials. That&#x27;s why earlier this year, we
announced the Advanced Web Apps Fund.
We&#x27;ve sponsored 11 projects, distributing more than $100k through the
Open Collective,
to recognize the importance of these projects and enable their creators to
spend time on them. These projects include:
Espruino Web IDE: makes coding Espurino boards
as easy as opening a web browser.
iPlug2: a free open source framework
for making audio plugins with minimal code.
PocketBase: open source realtime backend with
embedded database, real time subscript…</p>

          <p>Hello,
I built this web UI to merge multiple tree based e-commerce categories into one &quot;super tree&quot;.
You can export the super tree as JSON, and import it into another system such as a search engine.
Users can then select a single category and view items from all of the semantically equal categories.
The app is here: https://app.tree-merge.com/
You can download the sample categories and use them to demo the UI.

          <p>Container queries are a new CSS feature that enables you to write styling logic that targets features of a parent element (for example, its width or height) to style its children. Recently, a big update to the polyfill was released, coinciding with support landing in browsers.
In this post, you will be able to take a peek inside how the polyfill works, the challenges it overcomes, and the best practices when using it to provide a great user experience for your visitors.
# Under the hood
# Transpilation
When the CSS parser inside a browser encounters an unknown at-rule, like the brand new @container rule, it will simply discard it as if it never existed. Therefore, the first and most important thing the polyfill must do is transpile an @container query into something that won’t be discarded…</p>

          <p>A break in the Texas heat, Fall is in the air, and baseball is back on the menu. Neighbors having small conversations on the walks to-and-from the elementary school and kids putting on lemonade stand fundraisers for their friends. Humming birds saunter by my window each day. Texas comes alive in this reverse Spring, rediscovering simple pleasures…
Riding an eBike up a big, sweaty hill is one of life&#x27;s great pleasures.

          <p>Hi HN,
My friend tries to land her first job as UX. She had a maternity break from work, was working as buildings designer before. I can see she is slowly descending into depression since she gets rejected without being given feedback. Most recently she has gone through a series of interviews with the company, got to the final stage and was rejected- without any feedback. And this after investing her time into preparing assignments and taking tests...
I try to coach her out from depressive thoughts she is getting, but it&#x27;s not really helping. If I was running a company I would take her onboard, she wants to be UX but I think she would do whatever the current need would be to provide value.
Do you know of anyone looking to get junior UX? Any advice would be of great value to her, thanks in advance!

          <p>HTML is over 29 years old today. You must have used it in many projects during your career.
Perhaps the first time was modifying MySpace or some 90s/2000s social media site.
It&#x27;s used for laying out pages, adding buttons or building whole UIs. Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera all implement some latest standard of HTML.
What&#x27;s your biggest issue with HTML today in 2022?
What&#x27;s the one big thing you would change?
Which of your needs are not being met with HTML as it is today?

          <p>Aside from a foundational understanding of database operations I really lack the proper knowledge to make proper design descisions for my databases and aplications that interact with those databases. There arent many people at my company that are particularly wise when it comes to this topic and it feels like we are really missing out on some really simple improvements just because we are oblivious to them.
Are there any recommedations for essential reading or proper practice guides for improving database skills? I&#x27;m reading &#x27;Database Internals&#x27; by Alex Petrov and its really interesting so far but not so practically applicable for me at the moment. It would be great to hear any resources that made a real impact on how you went about working with databases.
I&#x27;m mainly interested in SQL databases but resources on no-SQL would be welcome too.

          <p>Thank you to all of you that participated in helping CSS pick a nesting
syntax. The CSSWG has discussed the results and has
decided to move forwards with @nest. This unblocks the syntax issue, enabling
the @nest spec to move forward.
# Results
Out of 7,590 total votes, @nest was a clear winner:
87% of respondents voted for @nest, 5% for @nest always, and 7% for
brackets. Such a large split was not estimated but is relieving to the
discussions.
# What&#x27;s next?
The CSSWG will continue to discuss the feature and move on to other issues.
You&#x27;ve all helped us very much, we really appreciate the time you took to
evaluate the options and provide feedback.</p>

          <p>In this post, we&#x27;re excited to share some significant improvements to the Chrome Extension getting started experience and a few ways you can be part of this dream.
# The old guide
Previously, the Chrome Extension Getting Started tutorial was a basic extension example that changed the background color of the current page when the user clicked a button in the extension popup. It also included an options page where you could pick one of four colors.
This basic example didn&#x27;t demonstrate how to add popular capabilities featured in real-world extensions. It was time for a revamp.
# A new approach
We know developers rely on our documentation to begin their Chrome extension learning journey, and our goal is to provide a path that is accessible, beginner-friendly, and relevant. Instead of trying t…</p>

          <p>Components have been an often requested feature in Eleventy. While I do consider it an unanswered question whether or not components are the best starting point for new developers, it’s hard to argue with the efficiency and delivery gains to be had for folks with a bit more experience.
Now, we could wait around for the heavier bundler-based frameworks to circle back and pretend like React server components are a revolutionary new pattern for HTML without JavaScript (can you imagine). But if I might be allowed to offer a well-argued and intellectually-bulletproof counterpoint: naw.
A History of Component-like Things #
Historically, Eleventy has offered a few component-like features. Before we move on, I think it’s worthwhile to go through the prior art here (for Eleventy specifically).

          <p>I’ve been noticing that I tend to spend a disproportionate amount of time in my personal projects trying to figure out the UX look and feel.
I have very little difficulty translating well made designs into whatever framework I’m working in, but struggle with creating those designs, especially when starting from scratch.
Are there any resources, advice, or mindsets you can give/recommend to help me improve this part of the process?

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/overflow-replaced-elements/ target="_blank">A change to overflow on replaced elements in CSS</a>
          <p>From Chrome 108, the following replaced elements respect the overflow property: img, video and canvas. In earlier versions of Chrome, this property was ignored on these elements.
This means that an image which was earlier clipped to its content box can now draw outside those bounds if specified to do so in a style sheet. The default browser style sheet clips the overflow to the content box with the following rules:
img {
  overflow: clip;
  overflow-clip-margin: content-box;
}
However, it is possible for your stylesheet to override this behavior by setting overflow: visible. The following examples show some cases where you might now see unwanted overflow.
The object-fit property is used to scale the image and fill the box. If the aspect ratio does not match the box, the image will draw outside of the bounds.
img {
  object-fit: cover;
  overflow: visible;
}
The border-radius property makes a square image look like a circle, but because overflow is visble the clipping no longer occurs.
img {
  border-radius: 50% 50%;
  overflow: visible;
}
Setting inherit: all and causing all properties to inherit, including overflow.
img {
  all: inherit;
}
# Solution
If this change means you see unwanted overflow, and overriding the overflow property to visible is not intentional, inspect the CSS applied to the element via DevTools. This should allow you to identify the CSS declaration which is overriding the overflow property to visible and remove it or update it to clip.
img {
    overflow: clip;
}
If updating the CSS is not trivial, another fix is to add the following inline style to the element.</p>

          <p>I&#x27;m Paul Kinlan, and I lead developer relations for Chrome. As part of my job, I get to work with a team of passionate web advocates who are tasked to bring the perspective of real world developers to our product and engineering teams, with the north star metric to improve developer satisfaction.
We recognize that &quot;satisfaction&quot; is an ambitious and subjective metric to track and improve, so we constantly iterate on how we can make an impact while focusing on developer needs. A guiding principle we&#x27;ve found useful to follow is—&quot;meet developers where they are&quot;. A recent Stack Overflow study showed that 75% of developers report using frameworks or an abstraction of some kind. So we&#x27;ve been asking ourselves how we best serve developers who have already made decisions about, or have no control …</p>

Every morning you decide what you will do and what you will not do by swiping away objectives and only keeping ones you want to focus on for the day.

I built Nodu to use myself (and to get my feet wet with SwiftUI). After reaching a V1, I decided to release it to the public.

          <p>A little while ago, Ana Tudor created an impressive collection of halftone patterns using only CSS. As I had a little time to spare, I thought I’d dig into the code and see how it was done! Ana’s demos are made using Sass — what better way to learn than to try to produce similar effects using vanilla CSS?
One of Ana Tudor’s beautiful halftone patterns created with CSS

Ana’s demo uses Houdini to animate the halftone background (only supported in Chromium browsers). For the purpose of this article we’re just going to be concentrating on the halftone pattern itself, rather than the animation.

          <p>Bootstrap v5.2.2 has landed with new bug fixes and documentation updates—keep reading to see what’s changed!
Highlights
Accordion

Use Sass variable for the accordion color instead of an invalid CSS variable
Buttons

Undo changes to .btn:hover from v5.2.1. We now explicitly target .btn-check styles instead.
Dropdowns

Temporarily restore ability for dropdowns to work without an explicit data attribute (will be removed again in v6)
Modals

Improve modal event listeners
Use 
 for all .modal-title instances in our docs
Tables

Don’t redefine $border-color in table-variant() mixin
Tabs

Tabs no longer autofocus and cause pages to jump on tab.show()
Fix .active class toggling of tabs within dropdowns
Toasts

Properly set toast z-index on .toast-container as opposed to individual .toasts that don’t receive any other positioning
Tooltips

Fix tooltip selectors with title attribute on dynamically created elements

          <p>Hello!
Last ditch effort here - a year ago or so there was posed a link to a page which had wonderful visual and text descriptions of different battery technologies and their tradeoffs.  It illustrated 5-6 different dimensions which one might optimize for (e.g. charging speed, capacity, cost, lifetime, etc) on these little charts which looked a bit like spiders&#x27; webs.
I thought that was a great resource, but didn&#x27;t save it at the time.  Anyone know what I&#x27;m talking about or have a link? Thanks!

          <p>Hi HackerNews,
As an early stage Product &amp; Tech Founder, we often wonder what is the good timing to have a Design System.
- Do you think it&#x27;s too soon during the early days?
- How do you manage product consistency without it?
- Do frontend engineers complain about not having one?
Our Founding Designer &amp; Product Manager, Mike, took the mic and tell us why he thinks you should have a design system from day 1: https://www.getlago.com/blog/how-soon-should-you-have-a-design-system
Happy to have your thoughts on this!

          <p>Today, Tumblr has something for everyone, whether you’re looking for art, memes, counterculture, or design inspiration. Designers, especially young ones, are making a silent comeback to this revived platform, which was considered “abandoned” by many back in 2018.
So what’s attracting Gen Z creatives to the microblogging platform?
As younger generations make the conscious decision to leave social media due to its “toxic effects,” the only logical next step is to create your own community so that you can express yourself freely without being bombarded by ads or obsessing over likes. In many cases, Gen Zers have been left without a creative outlet after ditching social media platforms, and Tumblr fits the bill perfectly.

          <p>When we started Chrome Dev Summit (CDS) in 2013, our goal was to connect directly with the web community. Each year I&#x27;ve looked forward to meeting with developers, learning what they were working on, and hearing their needs.  As we weren&#x27;t able to meet in-person for the last two years, our online CDS events were the best way for us to connect through AMAs, workshops, office hours and more.
Each year, we plan our engagements based on the state of the ecosystem to ensure we are addressing developers&#x27; needs as best we can. This year, instead of hosting CDS and asking you to come to us, we&#x27;re meeting you where you are in your region, at your favorite conferences and events, and on various online forums such as Twitter Spaces. Check out the list of events where you&#x27;ll find the Chrome team and bookmark this page to get the latest updates.
I&#x27;m so excited to get back into the community and we look forward to connecting with you at a virtual event, GDG DevFest, performance.now(), or another summit near you!</p>

          <p>Sharing tabs, windows, and screens is already possible on the web platform thanks to getDisplayMedia(). We’re now shipping the following improvements that guide the user away from accidental oversharing:
Sharing tabs is now the default option, rather than sharing screens.
The displaySurface option can indicate that the web app prefers to offer a specific display surface type (tabs, windows, or screens).
The surfaceSwitching option indicates whether Chrome should allow the user to dynamically switch between shared tabs.
The selfBrowserSurface option can be used to prevent the user from sharing the current tab. This avoids the &quot;hall of mirrors&quot; effect.
The systemAudio option ensures Chrome only offers relevant audio-capture to the user.

          <p>Writing HTML sucks.
I&#x27;ve been making websites and web apps for almost 10 years. As a developer, I&#x27;ve never liked it.
React and Tailwind made it an infinitely better experience for me, but something was still missing. Switching between the code and the browser all the time felt wrong. At the same time, I felt lost with No-code editors because they are made for designers not developers.
I&#x27;ve written about it extensively here: https://rogovoy.me/blog/writing-html-sucks
Impulse is my experiment to bridge that gap and make a &quot;design&quot; tool that works directly with my code.
With Impulse, I&#x27;ve come to love web design (again?).

How did you get started in illustration?
Like many artists out there, it all began with drawing as a child. I’ve always been creative and have loved telling stories through both visuals and words. I took art classes as a kid and loved every second of it! However, when it was time to make a career out of it, I was nervous. I thought pursuing something like graphic design o…</p>

          <p>The DevTools Recorder panel lets you capture user actions on your page, replay, share, and export them to a variety of formats you can use in your CI/CD.
The Recorder panel is in active development and has recently added new features to help you edit, debug, and export recordings.


With the Recorder panel, you can:
Slow down the replay, set breakpoints, pause, resume, or advance the execution one step at a time.
When paused, interact with the page or switch to other panels for further inspection.
Add steps that the Recorder doesn&#x27;t automatically capture. For example, mouse hover that pollutes recordings otherwise.
Configure steps, for example, add timeouts, conditions, and assertions.
Export the recordings in various formats such as JSON, @puppeteer/replay script, and Puppeteer script.
Additionally, you can add more export formats using Chrome extensions for the Recorder panel. At the time of writing, you can add extensions for the following tools: Cypress, WebPageTest, Nightwatch, Testing Library, and WebdriverIO. Check out the full list of extensions.
For more information:
To learn the basics, see Record, replay, and measure user flows.
For a complete list of features, see Recorder features reference.

This change will give Chrome users increased safety and peace of mind while browsing and installing extensions by providing more transparency and control over permissions, adding stricter protocols for accessing resources outside the extension’s context, and ensuring that extensions work well on all devices.
Chrome will take a gradual and experimental approach to turning off Manifest V2 to ensure a smooth end-user experience during the phase-out process. We would like to make sure developers have the information they need, with plenty of time to transition to the new manifest version and to roll out changes to their users. In support of that goal, we’re providing more deta…</p>
