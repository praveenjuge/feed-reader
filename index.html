          <p>I hope it&#x27;s not a too big can of worm I am opening here, and I can imagine it is quite subjective, but it would be nice to hear other people&#x27;s opinions about this.
I have programmed for quite a long time in both Python and Go and I also experimented with rewriting the same solution in each language - for smaller projects.
Performance Go of course beats Python in almost all aspects, but what about productivity?
My experience is in general Python is a lot more productive, with less code but if you don&#x27;t take care of keeping things well-organized then the productivity falls for bigger projects.
While on the other hand, Go seems to be more linear (similar) productivity even if you have a larger code base.
What is your experience with productivity, especially as the project matures?

          <p>I&#x27;ve been coming to Hacker News since 2005. Over that time it&#x27;s grown by many orders of magnitude.
The quality of the links has fluctuated but on the whole have stayed strong and, if anything, improved over time. I don&#x27;t know what the filtering process is but it works well - the articles feel pure and deeply interesting.
But the comments are trickier. As the size of the audience has grown, so have the number of comments. Which has the potential to be really interesting, except for the propensity of the UI to drive both readers and commenters deep into rabbitholes.
I used to love seeing the breadth of reactions to an article (or a new company). I could scan the comments to see what Hacker News thought. I quickly could get an idea of different perspectives and opinions. I could absorb the reaction of the Silicon Valley Coding Diaspora.
These days though it feels, at best, a deep, cloistered exploration of one POV, and at worst a triggered cascade of pedantry.
There are still amazing people and amazing observations in there. But they&#x27;re not easy to get to. There&#x27;s no easy way to scan the comments to get a sense of the breadth of reaction - it&#x27;s just a case of wading through all of them.
Back when I was in my 20s and soaking up everything I possibly could, I would happily invest that time. These days it doesn&#x27;t feel like such a good trade-off.
And I fear that in turn that penalises the potential breadth of reaction that this remarkable audience posesses. And reduces the participation of others who have less time - many of whom are more senior (decide for yourself whether you value that perspective).
If I could wave a wand, I&#x27;d love to see the threads collapsed by default. I feel like there are lot of potential UI wins that could further broaden engagement.
Would love to hear everyone else&#x27;s thoughts...
(Also... and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m thousandth person to ask this... how on earth is it that there is no dark mode to this dev-mecca?!)

          <p>Friday evening at 5pm on my way out of work I was about to push a feature fix up to add some encryption and decryption using crypto-js.  The API looks like this:

import CryptoJS from &#x27;crypto-js&#x27;

const encryptedThing &#x3D; CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(&quot;message&quot;, SECRET_KEY).toString()
const decryptedThing &#x3D; CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encryptedThing, SECRET_KEY).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8)


It’s an AES cipher block that puts a message in a cipher, and decrypts it on the other end. Cool. It uses math, like popular cryptographic technology Bitcoin, so you know it’s good.
As I was ready to push the code up, my tests were failing in the prepush hook. I knew the code was working but I’d have to appease Jest. Jest’s issue was it didn’t know about the import CryptoJS from &#x27;crypto-js&#x27; part because it only understa…</p>

          <p>Hi, I&#x27;m a web developer with several years of experience developing websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I´ve also developed several full stack applications with relatively complex backends (mainly Ruby/Ruby on Rails).
I&#x27;m currently on a teaching non-tenure track (teaching web technologies), which I love, but the pay in my country is very low.
I&#x27;m confident I have the creativity and formal knowledge to develop high quality static websites. So I&#x27;m looking for opportunities.
That said, I return to my initial question: is there still demand for semantic, performant, custom static websites?

I’m Joe, CTO at Dopt. We’re building a tool that lets you design user state machines with an SDK so that you can run them in your product.

Dopt lets you send in data about your users (identify calls/properties) and lets non-devs define rules based on that data for which users should enter the flows. Non-devs can also update content and other custom properties that can be referenced via the SDK.

          <p>By combining a couple of open-source projects, I created a simple, personalised solution for consuming your favourite RSS feeds via email. I built it for myself, but after a few tweaks, I opened up the repository for anyone with a GitHub account to fork or clone. To use it, just configure your own favourite RSS feeds, set up a cron schedule, and provide your own SMTP server.
The email can be fully customised and is made with this great new library: react-email. The project includes a development server, which you can run locally to test any tweaks you want to make to the email template.

          <p>In my 2023 review I mentioned that I wanted to give this site a revamp. This week I carved out some time to do just that. So, here it is: Welcome to the new and improved CSS { IRL }!
Design improvements
I felt like the previous UI was becoming a bit muddled as I added new features on an ad-hoc basis, without sitting down and committing to a plan. Also, I was just sick of looking at it! So this design is a bit more stripped back visually, without to many unnecessary flourishes, while still keeping some nice little touches, like animated underlines on hover. Other improvements include a better mobile experience (via the expanding/collapsing tag menu), and the ability to filter by category of post (currently “articles”, “notes” or “quick tips”, which I might add to over time).

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/what-is-the-top-layer/ target="_blank">Meet the top layer: a solution to z-index:10000</a>
          <p>The top layer sits above its related document in the browser viewport, and each document has one associated top layer. This means that elements promoted to the top layer needn&#x27;t worry about z-index or DOM hierarchy. They also get a neat ::backdrop pseudo-element to play with. The Fullscreen API spec goes into more details as Fullscreen was a great example of the top layer in use before dialog support came along.
The top layer helps solve the problem of rendering content above the rest of the document.
The important things to remember:
Top layer is outside of the document flow.
z-index has no effect in the top layer.
Each element in the top layer has a styleable ::backdrop pseudo-element.
Each element and ::backdrop generates a new stacking context.
Elements in the top layer are stacked in …</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/scrollend-a-new-javascript-event/ target="_blank">Scrollend, a new JavaScript event</a>
          <p>Before the scrollend event, there was no reliable way to detect that a scroll
was complete. This meant that events would fire late or while a user&#x27;s finger
was still down on the screen. This unreliability in knowing when scroll has
actually ended, led to bugs and a poor experience for the user.
document.onscroll &#x3D; event &#x3D;&gt; {
  clearTimeout(window.scrollEndTimer)
  window.scrollEndTimer &#x3D; setTimeout(callback, 100)
}
The best this setTimeout() strategy can do is know if scroll has stopped for
100ms. This makes it more like a scroll has paused event, not a scroll has
ended event.
After the
scrollend
event, the browser does all this difficult evaluation for you.
document.onscrollend &#x3D; event &#x3D;&gt; {…}
That&#x27;s the good stuff. Perfectly timed and packed full of meaningful conditions
before emitting.

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/default-offline/ target="_blank">Basic offline page for web apps on Chrome Android</a>
          <p>Installed platform apps can be launched even when offline. In this situation they often include a page letting the user know internet access is not available. Some developers even create a full set of features that can be used while offline.
With web apps, the capability to work offline is more recent; it became possible with the launch of the Service Worker API. Also, when websites became installable, PWA added a requirement to register a service worker and implement its fetch() method in order for a web app to be installable.
The idea was to incentivize developers to provide their users at least a notice that the app couldn’t be used at the moment.
Now developers won’t need to do anything to get a default offline page. From Chrome 109 on Android, the browser will automatically generate a page that lets the user know when they are offline.
If the app doesn’t implement a custom offline experience, when the user is offline, the default offline page uses the app’s icon and simple You are offline message. Like the example below.
Visit this glitch to see the previous example in action.
The option to create your own custom offline page is still available. The following video demonstrates how to serve your custom page, using Workbox, with a single line of code.


Even though the feature is available on Android only at the moment, we are working to bring it to desktop as well. If you have any feedback send it our way via this form

          <p>To replace functionality in the transition from background pages to extension service workers, developers can use the chrome.offscreen API and manifest permission starting in Chrome 109. Requesting this permission allows for the creation of off-screen documents to use DOM APIs without obtrusively opening new windows or tabs that interrupt the user experience. The chrome.offscreen API documentation is now available in chrome extensions.
In Chromium, Manifest V3 extensions are service worker-based, but service workers don&#x27;t provide support for the same APIs and mechanisms that full document-based pages (which include background and event pages) do. Additionally, using content scripts to access DOM APIs on web pages leaves the extension at the mercy of different content security policies on a…</p>

          <p>It will never let you down. Bitterness is never-ending, impenetrable and refuses to negotiate. If you give it a chance, it will persist. It lacks nuance or surprise. It’s simply a wall you can lean against, whenever you choose. Consistency is all it has to offer, actually.</p>

          <p>I&#x27;m pretty sure I originally found this on HN some years ago, maybe someone here can help me find it again.
I remember a video of a very small hydro power demo, about a meter across, something along the lines of a gravitational water vortex power plant[0], but instead of the usual turbine they had a pretty big, uh, piece (&quot;runner&quot;?) in the middle of the chamber with the vortex, taking up most of the space. I believe the idea was to extract energy from very low flows. I seem to recall the people presenting it were Swiss, or something else vaguely germanic, but I&#x27;m not really sure.
Anyway, I&#x27;ve thought about this thing for years, decided to try to find it again, and mostly failed in my google-fu. I don&#x27;t remember anything of the specific language used to describe it, just the visual. If anyone knows good search terms for this, I&#x27;m happy to hear those as well.
Thanks!

          <p>Olivia Hoskin
      Writer &amp; Design Enthusiast 

Oh, what would we do without our trusty MCM? This graphic design trend took the world by storm post-WWII for a good reason. The clean and straightforward lines did a lot to inspire future trends, including the minimalist movement that so many designers are so fond of.
And although these designs definitely give off a “retro” vibe, mid-century modern elements in graphic design aren’t going anywhere any time soon. Playful, shape-based lettering is still prevalent throughout many modern designs, along with many geometric stylings.
In fact, the colors, more than anything else, tend to give most MCM graphic designs a “retro” feeling. Trade in the earthy browns, oranges, and greens for some greyscale and neons, and you have a more modern Mid-century Modern aesthetic that any Palm Springs resident would be ecstatic about.  ■

You need a library that is different from React, but similar enough that people might actually use it
You need say it’s “fast”
You need 10 influencers to get hyped about it because it’s “fast”
You need a CLI
You need a specialized linter/formatter
You need a build process
You need a custom file extension
You need components
You need types
You need local and global state management
You need a marketing site
You need a doc site
You need dark mode
You need a module system
You need a dark mode module
You need a router module
You need an auth module
You need an image module
You need a metaframework for “apps” but really it’s just to make the doc site
You need a specialized doc site generator that competes with the metaframework
You need your metaframework to have islands
You need your metaframework to do SSG/SSR/CSR/Universal/ISR/ODB/CDN delivery backed by edge functions
And you need to get VC funding to do all this and ultimately become a cloud hosting provider

          <p>The art of styling drop caps has been around for hundreds, if not thousands of years. Its use in print styles to signify the start of a new section or chapter can be seen through history. But, it&#x27;s always been problematic to style in the digital age. There hasn&#x27;t been a &quot;clean&quot; solution to styling them.
The CSS initial-letter property will make things much easier.
# Browser support
Where can you try initial-letter? It&#x27;s available in Safari and from Chrome 110. In Safari, the property needs the -webkit- prefix. There is an open issue for it to be implemented in Firefox.
There is also an open Chromium issue detailing the related properties initial-letter-align and initial-letter-wrap that are still to be implemented as per the CSSWG spec.
Test for initial-letter support with:

          <p>I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m design-blind. As long as something is functional, and I have an accurate conceptual model of how it works, I can deal with it. The important part (to me) is whether I can do the things I want done without the product getting in the way. For example, Jira does a terrible job of this, by getting in the way.
What I&#x27;ve come to realise is that this is only a small part of the picture. There&#x27;s a lot more that goes into design: a product helping you build an accurate model, showing you what&#x27;s possible, getting out of your way, and the emotional positive response because of the sheer attention to detail.
Recently reading Design of Everyday Things, and I _love_ it because it helped me formulate a model of what objectively good design looks like.
I read RefactoringUI as well, and this felt a lot more &#x27;here are some good rule of thumbs to follow&#x27;. Awesome, but I feel I&#x27;m still fumbling in the dark. I find myself falling back to these because I don&#x27;t know better.
So, do you have any tips or resources for helping improve design sense?

          <p>Yesterday I was going through all the links in BBC, CNN, Guardian RSS stored during time of pandemic, for research purposes. I downloaded archived RSS files in archive.org, like for http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml. Unfortunately I have noticed that some days are missing in the archive.org.
I think it is a good idea, if you have a favorite site, which has a RSS source, to make a call to store it regularly in archive.org for &#x27;the next generations&#x27;. https://help.archive.org/help/save-pages-in-the-wayback-machine/.
I have updated my RSS client to make a such call everyday, even for my fav YouTube RSS sources.
Even if &#x27;link rot&#x27; gets in a way, this might be insightful to see at least link, or title, or description of the RSS entry. Historians might consider it useful some day.

Edit: …and stay for some good news at the end.
Steps I’ve taken so far

I fixed my  description crawl errors

          <p>Do you find yourself needing to switch between development environments frequently? That&#x27;s often the case for me. I work on a web app for wind turbine operators, and I regularly need to test my front end code with different databases.
My colleague recently alerted me to .ENV Switcher, a VS Code extension that makes switching between different environments simple. Once installed, you need to create your different .env files (such as dev.env, release.env). Then you bring up a list of .env files to select from by clicking on a small button at the bottom of the window, and instantly switch to the desired environment. Nice!

          <p>Project Fugu is a cross company effort to close gaps in the web&#x27;s capabilities, enabling new classes
of applications to run on the web. More concretely, this means adding new APIs to browsers that app
developers can use to enable previously impossible use cases. What APIs does your browser of choice
support? What web applications make use of these APIs? Let&#x27;s find out!
# How Fugu is my browser?
Project Fugu APIs such as File Handling,
File System Access,
Async Clipboard, and Web Share
have brought capabilities to the web that you might expect only to be possible in platform-specific
apps. For example, you can now double-click an image file so it opens in an associated PWA, make
modifications, save the changes back to the file, and then copy the image contents over into another
app or share…</p>

          <p>Hey fellow Sheets lovers,
I recently wrote a blog post on different ways to sync Google Sheets with MongoDB, and thought it would be useful to lay out the key points here for anybody who is facing this problem!
The problem
G sheets is an incredibly popular way for business teams to interact with data. You can use Sheets for internal tools, BI, ad hoc analysis, you name it.
However, it&#x27;s extremely tricky to sync data between G sheets and NoSQL databases like MongoDB. This limits the usefulness of either tool.
So, what options are there? There are a few.
Method #1: Write your own script
You could build your own in-house solution using Google&#x27;s API and MongoDB change streams. Mongo&#x27;s change streams make it pretty easy to track events in MongoDB, but the Google API is trickier to work with. Fo…</p>

          <p>The other day I came across a pretty much textbook use case for container queries in the web app I was working on. We have this card component that displays a health summary for the section of the app the user is currently inspecting (which could be a wind turbine, a system within that turbine, or the entire wind farm). Generally we want to show that towards the top left of the screen, with some other information on the right. On certain pages however, the information on the right will be absent, so we want the health summary component to go full width.

          <p>Hi HN,
Curious to know whether any of you have noticed significant improvements in developer productivity due to adapting a functional style of system building?
On the surface, it looks like FP will lead to a more modular and decomposed system, and hence would lead to greater re-usability and maintainability.
Moreover, if you have any thoughts/experiences on how adapting FP impacts a software dev team (or just individuals) currently operating in imperative style, please share your views.

With AbortController and AbortSignal available, let’s create a better JavaScript function for […]

          <p>It came to my attention that my site does not appear on DuckDuckGo search results. Even when searching for “daverupert.com” directly. After some digging, DuckDuckGo used to get their site index from Yandex, but now gets their site index from Bing and sure enough… I didn’t appear on Bing either.
First of all… rude. I’m the one person I know who actually uses Bing and I started using DuckDuckGo on my Mac… and they have the audacity —nay, the cowardice!— to shadow ban me and my contributions to the Web!? I —a southern gentleman— take the highest offense at this slighting and misconstruing of my character. I do declare.
SEO isn’t one of my top objectives with this site, so initially I dismissed it. But that nerdsnipe shot a signal flare up in my brain that spun into mystery I needed to solve. …</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34383168 target="_blank">Ask HN: Are you glad you&#x27;re using Material UI (React library)?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;m normally someone who builds my core React components for a given project from scratch; it&#x27;s not hard and I have maximum control if needs change (and don&#x27;t have to go read a bunch of docs)
But right now I need to build a boring admin interface for somebody, with limited time to dedicate to it and it doesn&#x27;t matter what the look and feel is or anything. So I&#x27;m considering pulling in a library like MUI so I can more quickly just bang out an interface and move forward
Question is: does Material UI&#x27;s convenience outweigh the extra complexity of adding a dependency, reading its docs, learning its conventions, etc? Especially for a relatively quick and simple thing
(MUI-specific anecdotes only please; not interested in speculation or in discussions about the broader question of whether to add a dependency to a project)

          <a href=https://macaron.js.org/ target="_blank">Show HN: I made Macaron – Type-safe CSS-in-JS with zero-runtime and colocation</a>
          <p>Hey HN, my name is Mokshit and I&#x27;m really interested in web-performance and web-development. At the time of writing this, I&#x27;m a junior in high school.
Macaron is a typesafe CSS-in-JS library with zero runtime, colocation, maximum safety and productivity.
The motivation behind it is that runtime CSS-in-JS libraries, that is most of the CSS-in-JS libs, add alot of bloat to web apps and have a considerable performance drop with a bundle size increase. Alot of them also don&#x27;t support more performant ways of building web apps like streaming markup. Most of the current compile-time CSS-in-JS libraries try to fix this, but have some or the other drawback like not offering colocation, or not being type-safe.
Today, Macaron does all this with a compiler that extracts all the style declarations at compile-time and converts them to static css files while also letting you author the type-safe styles in the same file as your application code. It supports both - a vanilla styling API and a styled-component API with support for multiple frameworks like SolidJS and React and build tools like Vite and Esbuild. Macaron is currently missing a webpack plugin, but that will also be published soon, making it compatible with almost all bundlers.
There&#x27;s a ton of room for improvement in this space, and I feel like macaron is a step in that direction.

          <p>There are 3 primary reasons why one human may be more effective than another in a given work situation.
Caring - All things being equal, somebody who cares more about a problem / product will generally be more effective1.  Caring can range from “startup founder” level obsession to being completely checked out, and effectiveness will vary on that spectrum.
Capacity - The amount of time and mental resources a team member can bring to a problem matters and will vary over time.  Illness, stress, a busy personal season or competing work priorities can reduce this temporarily for anyone.  Some people will have longer term lower capacity than others due to factors like life circumstances, health, and outside of work commitments.
Leverage - People’s skills, experiences, tendencies, relationships a…</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/iframe-credentialless/ target="_blank">Iframe credentialless: Easily embed iframes in COEP environments</a>
          <p>Iframe credentialless is enabled by default from Chrome version 110. It solves the most common complaint developers working with Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP) have: embedding third-party iframes that do not set COEP.
It was previously available as an origin trial from version 106 to 108, and known as anonymous iframe.
# Why we need COEP
Some web APIs increase the risk of side-channel attacks such as Spectre. To mitigate that risk, browsers offer an opt-in-based isolated environment called cross-origin isolation, which requires deploying COEP. Cross-origin isolation allows websites to use privileged features including SharedArrayBuffer, performance.measureUserAgentSpecificMemory(), and high-precision timers with better resolution.
To enable cross-origin isolation, websites must send t…</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/cookie-max-age-expires/ target="_blank">Cookie Expires and Max-Age attributes now have upper limit</a>
          <p>As of Chrome release M104 (August
2022) cookies can no longer set an
expiration date more than 400 days in the future.
This change does not impact session cookies—cookies that do not explicitly set
an expiration date with Max-Age or Expires—as these are instead cleared when
the browsing session ends.
With this change, Chrome caps the expiration date to the maximum allowed value:
400 days from the time the cookie was set. Cookies that request an expiration
date further out than 400 days aren&#x27;t rejected; their expiration date is set to
400 days instead.
# Example
For example, consider a cookie set on Sunday, January 1, 2023:
Cookie
      Requested expiration
      Days in future
      Over 400 days?
      Effective expiration

# CSS
This release adds two new CSS features.

Initial letters are large, decorative letters that have been used to start new sections of text since before the invention of printing. The CSS initial-letter property provides a way to set the number of lines that an initial-letter should sink into following lines of text.

I don&#x27;t want this: https://hnrss.org/frontpage because it show in my RSS feed two links to articles and comments. I just want feed of those articles with previews, just like other feeds that I&#x27;m used to subscribe.

          <p>Basically from a “quality triangle” perspective – execs can control costs or time, but holding the line on a minimum quality bar is essentially a core piece of my job, and nobody wins when you try to promise impossible combinations of scope/quality/dates.</p>

          <p>In an ideal world, org leaders define goals and teams figure out what to do.  But top down asks happen.  How I decide whether to push back on top down asks as an EM:
a. Fine to be asked for a date or a scope (not both)
b. Never ship something likely to cause an incident</p>

# About SQLite
SQLite is a popular, open-source, lightweight,
embedded relational database management system. Many developers use it to store data in a
structured, easy-to-use manner. Because of its small size and low memory requirements, SQLite is
often leveraged as a database engine in mobile devices, desktop applications, and web browsers.
One of the key features of SQLite is that it is a serverless database, which means that it does not
require a separate server process to operate. Instead, the database is stored in a single file on
the user&#x27;s device, makin…</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/audiocontext-setsinkid/ target="_blank">Change the destination output device in Web Audio</a>
          <p>Until now, setting the destination audio output device was only possible for  and  with HTMLMediaElement.setSinkId(). In Web Audio, AudioContext used the default device, leaving the user to change the system audio output device manually.
From Chrome 110, you can use AudioContext.setSinkId() to programmatically direct the audio output in Web Audio to any permitted device.
This is especially helpful in a variety of real-time communication scenarios. For example, a web app can use this to programmatically direct output to a specific audio output device such as a Bluetooth headset or speakerphone.

First, you need the identifier of the audio output device you want to use as a destination. Get the list of available media devices with naviga…</p>

          <p>I’ve been a full-time professional web developer for 17 years. In that time, I’ve seen things.
I remember when web browser developer tools were first introduced, using Firebug for the first time.
I predate even the WebKit mobile revolution: a time when proxy browsers reigned supreme and Blackberry was king.
I bore witness to the React schism, ruthlessly popularizing Single Page Apps and clientside rendering; giving rise to a slower web in the name of developer experience.
I embraced the npm revolution.
I rode the waves of Node.js.
I webpacked across The Great Divide.
The Great Divide #
The Great Divide really resonated with me. I keep coming back to it and I do think it continues to accurately describe what feels like two very distinct and separate camps of web developer.

          <p>I’ve come across several products that automatically convert Figma designs into code. From what I see, they do a good job of generating React components and CSS from Figma designs.
It seems to be that these should be the standard way to make frontends, but it is not. Why is that? Am I missing something?

          <p>As a software engineer, on my own I’ve been able to increase my efficiency and productivity at my current job over the years with the help of various programs such as command line interfaces (CLIs), GUI extensions (VS, VS Code, Chrome), software applications, and other shortcuts (aliases, etc.).  I know everyone has different preferences and work styles, but I can’t help but think what I’ve been able to apply would be useful for other developers at my company.
Undoubtedly, there are other developers at my company have their own set of programs/workflows they use to increase their efficiency that I think could be useful to me and others.
I&#x27;m curious to know what strategies other developers use or have used within their company to share productivity tips and programs with their colleagues. For example, is there a dedicated Teams/Slack channel, an internal wiki, or some other type of software where engineers can share/demo programs and shortcuts they use in their day-to-day work?

          <p>I&#x27;ve been experimenting with a smart RSS reader and I&#x27;ve been using Superfeedr to ingest content.  Superfeedr monitors RSS feeds and calls a webhook when content arrives,  I stuff these into an Amazon SQS and then spool them out at my leisure.
My system requires a fairly high volume (1000&#x27;s of articles) to train a machine learning model so I have been focusing on high volume feeds like preprints from the arXiv,  news from the Guardian, etc.
Now Superfeedr charges 10¢ per feed per month,  my bill right now is $3 a month.  It&#x27;s reasonable that I can subscribe to about 100 feeds on Superfeedr but subscribing to 1000 feeds seems pricey to me.
There are a lot of independent blogs out there that publish an article every week or every six months.  What they all have in common is that somebody has to poll an RSS file many many many times per article ingested.  W/ superfeedr it makes for high costs but it is a hassle even if I built my own RSS ingest system.
One thing that would help would be consolidated RSS feeds that aggregate posts from a large number of blogs.  Are there good ones out there?  Are there other answers to problem of polling hundreds or thousands of independent blogs?

# Recorder: Copy as options for steps, in-page replay, step’s context menu
Open an existing user flow in the Recorder. Previously, when you replayed the user flow, DevTools would always start the replay by navigating to or reloading the page.
With the latest updates, the Recorder shows the navigation step separately. You can right-click and remove it to perform in-page replay!
Apart from that, you can right-click a step and copy it to the clipboard in the *Recorder panel instead of exporting the whole user flow. It works with extensions too. For example, try to copy a step as a Nightwatch Test script. With this feature, you can update any existing script with ease.

          <p>Form validation has always been my least favorite part of web development.

There used to be a correlation between superior performance and price. In 1900, an Hermes saddle or a Louis Vuitton trunk was arguably better built for the work it was put […]</p>

          <p>Hi.
I&#x27;m curious, how do you prefer consuming RSS news feed?
Do you prefer text-oriented News Aggregators like the HackerNews website or image-oriented ones with a small text/description layout?
Personally, reading small text only like HN page sometimes I feel there should be more customization to config view for user preferences, but I don&#x27;t need images preview out there.
What about you?

          <p>I’ve lost track of what Microsoft’s officially endorsed way of building cross platform applications for Windows and Xbox is.
There was silver light, UWP, others?
What would I use if I wanted to build an Xbox/Windows app?

          <p>At one point during the construction of my house, we needed designs for the kitchen and bathroom cabinets and a bedroom wardrobe.
I wanted full control of the design process. Doing it in vector illustration software was too painful and it was taking too long. But I didn&#x27;t have the time to learn any complex CAD tool either.
So I developed a small HTML/JS/CSS tool for designing MDF furniture by writing my own little language that transpiles into a CSS grid layout.
Take a look at the blog post for details:
https://alnvdl.github.io/2023/01/07/designing-furniture-usin...
Or go directly to the tool (works best on desktop or tablet): https://alnvdl.github.io/squareplanner/

          <p>It’s a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.
Read more about RSS Club.

After a good long hem n’ haw about Texas politics my friend Daniel filled a conversational pause by jokingly asking…
“So what’s good?”
A question made in jest, but it has stuck in me like a knife. I now see my ability to complain everywhere. On the walk to school with neighbors they ask how it’s going, “Ughck. I’m busy”, or “Ughck. It’s hot”, or “Ughck. Kids putting on shoes, amirite?!”
I’m trying to figure this out. It’s starting to bother me because I don’t believe myself to be a negative or overly pessimistic person. But there are times I hear the vibe-killing “Debbie Downer” sludge pouring out of my mouth.
The best I can come up with is…
I think it’s easier to complain? My negativity bias bubbling to the surface. Is it easier for humans to commiserate on bad circumstances rather than celebrate good ones?
It’s an attempt to self-deprecate? Life is going good but I don’t want you to think it’s going too good.
My engineering brain? I spend every day finding and predicting problems, is my brain over-tuned to find problems?
Either that or I’m a big ol’ StrongSad. Hm.</p>

          <p>What - I am working on a specification/language which can describe a traditional system design process for web-services.
Why - Having a language for system-design will improve design interviews and system documentation. It can also give rise to &quot;Competitive Designing&quot; industry same as &quot;Competetive Programming&quot; exists currently.
How - I am exploring existing specs (Docker-compose, OpenAPI and UML) and a way to merge them. They will define the system.
For the actual execution, I will use the spec to setup a sandbox environments and run blank instances of services in them. Then I would use custom defined API flows from the spec to simulate an actually running system.
This is not the hard part. The hard part is finding a way to benchmark these API flows which gives reliable scores for the effectiveness of the system for a given problem and API flows.
Happy to discuss more.

I&#x27;ve been loosing weight successfully in the past but I have the impression it impacts my productivity and my mood: I get tired, I have low energy, even lethargic.
I want to remove the excess kgs again in next 6 months and would love to hear your hacks to dieting without loosing my positive energy.

I haven’t done a yearly review in a few years. Looking back at those old posts, it seems like I wrote some very bland listicles that wrapped up the different web development community work and side projects that happened during the year. This year I’m just gonna write free-form and see what happens 😅.

Probably the biggest news this year is that Eleventy graduated from side project to full time sponsorship (thank you Netlify!!) in February and everything changed.
Looking back at the before-times, I’m not sure how I managed this project without full time sponsorship.
The most important thing I’m doing in my life is being a dad. I’m reminded of the Jamstack Conf panel a few months back. The moderator asked panelists “What do you like to …</p>

          <a href=https://daverupert.com/2023/01/html-with-superpowers-the-guidebook/ target="_blank">HTML with Superpowers: The Guidebook</a>
          <p>Psst… I’ve been keeping a secret. As part of my Web Components course on Frontend Masters, I built an entire guidebook on how to get started with Web Components. A Web Components 101. I spent hundreds of hours preparing the materials for the course and I’m excited to announce that today I’m making the guidebook public for everyone to get started with Web Components.
Read the Guidebook
This guidebook is different! Most Web Component resources drop you right into the JavaScript parts. Ughck. That’s fine, I guess, but seeing the markup for a  component doesn’t make my heart or brain sing. It also doesn’t help me understand one of Web Components’ biggest mental hurdles: The Shadow DOM. To overcome this, I’ve intentionally designed my course to build out layer-by-layer from HTML→CSS→JavaScript, like how old timers learned the web development in the past.
Starting with  and  –and most certainly with Web Component styling– you become familiar with the quirks of Shadow DOM first before writing your own from scratch. Following the navigation from left-to-right you’ll learn the ins-and-outs of Using → Styling → Writing the different flavors of Web Components. And because it’s part of the Web Platform, that knowledge will always be valuable.
HTML-first may seem overly basic, but I find that lots of new and experienced developers alike have never even tried using a Web Component off the shelf. That’s my favorite part of Web Components! You can use lots of Web Components without a build process or any kind of Webpack sorcery. A script tag + HTML and you’re using them! Web Components make it easy to (dependably) use other people’s code.
You can of course still watch my Web Components course on Frontend Masters. I recommend it if you’re an visual or auditory learner like myself. There’s also a bit more back-and-forth with the live audience and their questions.</p>

          <p>As seen with things like open source software, many developer tools, Hacker News as a website and people&#x27;s opinions on CSS and modern web design on places like Reddit?
Cause it feels like many people&#x27;s tastes come from the 80s/early 90s, with the idea that any sort of visual flourish or attempt at readability is completely irrelevant.
And it makes me wonder why this is. Why do so many... hacker type individuals seem to prefer very brutalist, utilitarian designs over anything more fancy? Where did this preference for plain text at the expense of all else come from anyway?
Because I don&#x27;t think this happens quite as much in other fields, like architecture, cooking or construction.

          <p>Hey all, I&#x27;m a product designer and I built this cause&#x27; when I was designing liquidity pool and staking features for this DAO, I didn&#x27;t know how the user flow worked and how the UI looked for similar pages, so I was constantly switching back and forth Balancer, Uniswap, and OlympusDAO as references.
I thought that I might not be the only one with this problem, so I built this library of userflow screenshots, and annotated them, to share with the web3 community of builders, designers, and developers.
Would love feedback if you&#x27;re a builder in web3, let&#x27;s connect too!
(Also I&#x27;m aware that there are some that&#x27;ll claim web3 is a scam, but I believe in it, to each their own.)

          <p>If you&#x27;re a causal player or casual buyer of retro stuff, particular the Game Boy, it&#x27;s easy to end up with a fake, or reproduction cart. This is a really short guide on what to look for if you want to be sure if it&#x27;s original or not.
This is a non-exhaustive guide, intended for the uninitiated :)

Before we start
It&#x27;s worth saying that in a lot of cases, if you just want to play the game, a reproduction cart might be what you&#x27;re looking for. For instance, an original copy of Amazing Tater or Shantae (both great fun) might be a little beyond what&#x27;s considered affordable.

If you were going to make a code library that a GPT-4 like system could use in writing code, what features and aspects would you consider to make it easier for the AI to use?

          <p>As employees return from holiday break, [Shopify] said it’s conducting a “calendar purge,” removing all recurring meetings with more than two people “in perpetuity,” while reupping a rule that no meetings at all can be held on Wednesdays. Big meetings of more than 50 people will get shoehorned into a six-hour window on Thursdays, with a limit of one a week.
This is fascinating to me.  I get the desire to remove bloated meetings, but there are recurring meetings that I find genuinely valuable to have sync (project standups / staff meetings).  Curious if this ends up being a long term policy for Shopify or more of a culture reset.</p>

          <p>I read 13 “work related” books in 20221. They’re broken up by category below.  I didn’t think any of these books were bad, but the ones I would recommend have a star next to them.
Decision Making
⭐ How To Decide by Annie Duke - Annie Duke takes her poker background and applies it to making decisions in other contexts – lots of practical decision making strategies here
⭐ The Scout Mindset by Julia Galef — somewhat similar ground to to “How You Decide”, but more of a focus on viewing the world objectively.  I really enjoyed reading these 2 books together.
Productivity
⭐ Make Time by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky — A nice book full of practical tips for managing your time and reclaiming control from distractions
Product Process
⭐ The Messy Middle by Scott Belsky — The best description of what …</p>

Stacking viruses ran through our kids over the course of three weeks. My immune system was shaky but held on. It culminated in ear infections in both kids and I learned the city of Austin has a shortage on antibiotics. New, incredible ways the American healthcare system can fail that I never anticipated.
This month ended in some sadder news that after a series of tests and treatments we’ve learned that our 13 year old dog Rudy has Transitional Cell Carcinoma, a form of bladder cancer that is inoperable and non-responsive to radiation and chemo. The outlook is not good, a matter of weeks or months, and we’re already at weeks. Holding out hope the k…</p>

          <p>Spent the last 3 years in home office where I have a standing desk setup. Came into a coworking space today with no standing desks. Feel like I’m half asleep. I can’t be any more than 50-60% as productive as when I was standing!
Crazy that we know sitting is bad for you. How much productivity change, if any, have you felt if you’ve tried switching to stand up work?
Also, what an easy win for a lot of companies, if productivity changes 10-20% plus on standing desks, what an incredible easy boost that is.

Work
At the end of 2021 I started a new job as Senior Front End Developer at Ada Mode, a data science and AI company working in the renewable energy sector. It’s been a great year for the company, as we’ve taken on a bunch of exciting projects and continued to make a name for ourselves. The year has been full of interesting challenges and learning opportunities for me personally, working with Vue and D3.js in particular, (and AWS, which has been less fun 😅) and it’s been a pleasure to work with the friendly and knowledgeable team. I’m looking forward to the company continuing to grow in 2023 as we hire new developers and begin projects spanning sustainable agriculture, wind energy, nuclear decommissioning, solar power an…</p>

          <p>Another year has come and gone. I can’t believe it. I think I’ll look back on 2022 as a year of milestones. It’s been a year of new jobs, new challenges, new products, and new hobbies. This is my second year piecing my year together from my monthly vibechecks. I think I’ve boiled those posts down to some major themes from the past year.
My new job at Luro

The biggest change this past year is my employment, I’m working full-time on Luro. What began as a side project app has grown into it’s own little stealth startup. And when I say startup, I mean startup. Over the course of the last year, we took a bit of pre-seed investment, made our first hires, re-architected the app, and onboarded our first round of private beta users.
There have been ups and downs starting a SaaS business in the head…</p>

          <p>let&#x27;s say I am using Tailwind CSS (licensed under MIT) in my website by using the npm package &quot;tailwindcss&quot; which on build creates a css file. According to MIT - &quot;The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.&quot;.
The css file that is created has a comment on top &quot;/* ! tailwindcss v3.0.23 | MIT License | https://tailwindcss.com */&quot;
Is that sufficient? or do I need to include the whole MIT text or do I need to make a /license page and write about it there &quot;tailwindcss is used in this website, licensed under MIT - full MIT license here&quot;? if not, how do I do it correctly?
I saw some sites like which seem to use tailwindcss but in the devtool sources only have the top line in the css &quot;tailwindcss v3.0.23 | MIT License | https://tailwindcss.com&quot; is that a violation of the MIT license?

          <p>Finally feeling like society around me has settled into it&#x27;s stride, even many normal things have happened, but as I write my last blog post of the year (as I&#x27;ve done for over a decade), I&#x27;m not entirely happy with how I feel like my blog has been neglected.
Work
Since the pandemic hit us back in early 2020, I&#x27;ve been working (mostly) flat out because we really didn&#x27;t know what would happen to the economy.
My typical work contract would be, at most, a few months, but instead I&#x27;ve been working very long term with clients. This is really good for our security but not something I&#x27;m used to and I can see the impact it&#x27;s had on my creativity around side projects that I&#x27;d normally work towards.
More obvious (to me) is my lack of blogging and really the motivation to write has gone utterly kaput.…</p>

          <a href=https://www.rssbrain.com/ target="_blank">Show HN: RSS Brain</a>
          <p>I wrote an RSS reader called RSS Brain recently. The motivate is the current RSS readers either don&#x27;t sort articles by priority, which makes it hard to read posts from HackerNews and Reddit, or sort it with some &quot;smart&quot; algorithm which I don&#x27;t trust. I also like the Google News feature that can show related story from different source, but the sources are not configurable and the algorithm is not transparent either. So with RSS Brain, I implemented these features:
* Recommend related articles from the feeds of your choice. It&#x27;s backed by ElasticSearch and the algorithm is described on RSS Brain&#x27;s website.
* Option to sort articles by upvotes and time. The algorithm is similar to the old Reddit and you can find it on the website as well.
* Save search terms into folders so you can filter the articles.
I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and found these features very helpful. So I want to share this on HackerNews. The frontend is written in Flutter so it has cross platform clients, even though the web version don&#x27;t feel very &quot;web native&quot; because the level of Flutter web support. I guess only time can improve that.
I don&#x27;t have enough hardware to scale it up so it&#x27;s currently in subscription mode to limit the users. I&#x27;m going to open source the code (maybe non-commercial license) once I think it&#x27;s ready so you can host it by yourself. It&#x27;s still in early stage and haven&#x27;t been tested by a lot of people. So any feedback is helpful. Thanks!
Update: Added a scroll down hint in the landing page. Thanks for the feedback.

          <p>Hi there, I built a chrome extension to grab new posts from social media.
Instagram, twitter, Pinterest, etc don&#x27;t really allow for RSS so I worked on this alternative to get new posts. Hope this might be useful for some of you.

          <p>I am making a feed reader that (i) would like to show you a significant amount of text in the feed and (ii) builds models to cluster and classify the text
In terms of length I like the abstracts of scientific papers on sites like arxiv.org.
I have more scientific papers now than I can stand, so I am looking for high volume RSS feeds of a huge paragraph or a few small paragraphs on any topics:  the subject could be sports or javascript programming, product reviews, any kind of journalism or other non-fiction.
Good length is the first qualification but to feed this beast I would love feeds that get 10, 20 or 50 articles a day.
Any suggestions?
