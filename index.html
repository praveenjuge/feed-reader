          <p>Through the little Etsy store I&#x27;ve got, I offer Game Boy game repair mostly just so I get to &quot;play&quot; on different problems, and a different problem did arrive.
This Game Boy Advance game, although worked, requires a battery for the real time clock aspects of the game (i.e. timed events). The problem was that there was a repair attempt that had taken off the entire pad for the battery, and in fact had go through the pad, through the silk screen and had gone all the way into the fibre glass insulation layer (you might be able to see in the photo the woven pattern).
Before slapping a battery on and jumping the positive leg to the right component, I wanted to check that nothing else was missing. Thankfully the community have tried to preserve a lot of the history (in this case, the PCB traces) but also published it freely on the web.
From this I also found a resistor had been lost in the previous repair. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s clear from my photo, but what I did was to bond the missing resistor in a completely different location (before it traces to a capacitor) and then use a jumper wire from the replaceable battery case. This was mostly in case the battery case was torn off again it wouldn&#x27;t cause damage to the components on the board.
Once that was all done, the game happily had its clock and was returned to it&#x27;s owner the same day.</p>

          <p>Web SQL was first proposed in April 2009 and abandoned in November 2010. Gecko
never implemented it and WebKit removed it in 2019. Web SQL was removed for
third-party contexts in Chromium 97. Chromium 105 deprecated Web SQL in
insecure contexts and showed a warning in the DevTools Issue panel when the
feature is used. Chromium 110 removed Web SQL in insecure contexts. Complete
removal in insecure contexts and eventually all contexts is planned for Chromium 119.
[✅ Done.] Web SQL was deprecated and removed for third-party contexts in
Chromium 97 (November 16, 2021).
[✅ Done.] Web SQL access in insecure contexts was deprecated as of
Chromium 105 (August 30, 2022) at which time a warning message
was shown in the Chrome DevTools Issue panel.
[📍 We are here.] Web SQL access in insecure contexts is no longer
available as of Chromium 110 (February 7, 2023). An
enterprise policy to keep using the feature is available from
Chromium 110 (February 7, 2023) to Chromium 123
(March 26, 2024).
[🔮 In the future.] Web SQL access in all contexts is deprecated as of
Chromium 115 (July 18, 2023) and a warning message is shown
in the Chrome DevTools Issue panel.
[🔮 In the future.] Web SQL access in all contexts is no longer available
in Chromium 119 (November 7, 2023)
[🔮 In the future.] A
deprecation trial to
keep using Web SQL is available from Chromium 118
(October 10, 2023) to Chromium 123 (March 26, 2024).
See the post Deprecating and removing Web SQL for all details on this deprecation.</p>

          <p># Introduction
(This article is also available in form of a video.)
  
  

Photopea is a free online image editor developed by Ivan Kutskir. Ivan started working on the app in 2012, and maintains a blog sharing the major features he adds to Photopea. Photopea can work with PSD (Adobe Photoshop), XCF (GIMP), Sketch (Sketch App), XD (Adobe XD), and CDR (CorelDRAW) formats.
# File handling in Photopea
As an installable PWA, Photopea runs in a standalone window when the user chooses to install the app. Doing so unlocks a PWA super power, which Photopea makes heavy use of: file handling.
# The declarative part of the File Handling API

          <p>In 2009 I prototyped a form that disabled the submit button until all the answers were valid.
The idea being: the best error is the one the user never sees.
But disabled buttons takes this rule to the extreme.
And as a result it can frustrate users or worse, cause them to give up completely.
Here’s why:
Problem #1: They don’t give feedback
When a form has mistakes, the user has to look at each field, spot a mistake and work out how to fix it.

				
			Kotak Bank’s disabled button does not give feedback
	

Problem #2: They make the interface feel broken
If the user thinks their answers are valid, the UI may feel broken. If there are multiple errors and 1 is fixed, the button stays disabled. This feels unresponsive.

          <p>I&#x27;m working on designing Open Source software, and while I can&#x27;t internationalize, localize, and accessiblize (!) it now, I want to make it easy to internationalize, localize, and accessibilize it later.
To design properly, I need to know the factors that go into those things. Please list all that you know of, whether for GUI&#x27;s or TUI&#x27;s. It&#x27;s okay to repeat factors because it&#x27;s good to know what&#x27;s most important too.
Here&#x27;s my non-complete list for each.

* Be able to swap all output strings depending on language.
* If output needs to be formatted, be able to put the format items in any order because languages put things in different orders.
* Support for left-to-right, right-to-left, and boustrophedon [1] scripts. (Is boustrophedon necessary?)

It&#x27;s still kind of buggy, but (for me at least, I&#x27;ve seen lots of people complain about modern uis) it&#x27;s more comfortable than regular HN, and maybe other people will find it useful.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35913997 target="_blank">Ask HN: What site do you use that kept an old design?</a>
          <p>I love websites that kept a 90s to early 00s look and feel. I recently rediscovered conversationexchange.com on the web and it was a pleasure to use. 
More important, old sites that used to be great, get a polish the moment bean counters get in charge. It usually is a sign of bad things to come ( I am looking at you gandi.net) .
If you know a website that bucks the trend, like craiglist, please post it below.

          <p>Ive been currently working with and interviewing many different product managers and Im finding the &quot;unicorn&quot; product managers are the ones that have actual System design thinking skills.
Without these, I feel that product management becomes too nebulous and generic. Speaking specifically about software product management.
Im keen to understand how this fits with others

          <p>Hey everyone,
While developing, I realized that there aren&#x27;t great existing JS libraries to convert reStructuredText (RST) to HTML. Without WASM, I would&#x27;ve either tried to port the docutils code or pre-compute the rendered HTML.
It&#x27;s exciting to start to leverage these new tools, and I hope this small demo gives you inspiration when thinking about client-side libraries :)

          <a href=https://livefir.fly.dev/ target="_blank">Show HN: Build progressively enhanced reactive HTML apps using Go and Alpine.js</a>
          <p>Fir leverages Golang’s standard library html/template package and a bit of alpinejs to allow building reactive UIs. You start with plain old html and use alpinejs to enhance it to bring no-page-reload interactivity to web apps.
The Fir toolkit is designed for Go developers with moderate html/css &amp; js skills who want to progressively build reactive web apps without mastering complex web frameworks. It includes a Go library and an Alpine.js plugin.
How it works ?
On receiving user-interactions the fir server re-renders html templates and sends it over the wire where the fir client library selectively updates the changed areas.
When a user event is received by a Fir route, an array of html templates are rendered on the server and returned as an array of DOM events to the browser. The DOM events are consumed by the alpinejs plugin and dispatched within the DOM where listeners attached to elements can use the event to update the DOM.
See the demo and quickstart here: https://livefir.fly.dev/

          <p>Robb Owen writes on the state of front-end development…
I’ve personally never really seen frontend as an assembly job. Lego is admittedly awesome, but for me the mental model of assembling Lego bricks in the required order until a Jira ticket can be marked as “done” feels too linear and too rigid for how I like to work.
Robb’s post is a wonderful celebration of non-linear production flows. I’m a fan and agree that assembling LEGO bricks can be boring and a bit industrial, it certainly takes a different mindset. I have strong opinions that Big Agile is actually the wrong answer for most creative collaboration work, creative work is much better suited by a prototyping demo loop or a hot-potato process to overcome the tension between design and development, but that’s another topic…

          <p>There are many reasons for developers to bring the web to Android: maybe reusing a web widget in an Android app, incorporating first-party or third-party content, even bringing their entire web app to the platform. Whatever the use case, Android has many tools to make it possible.
Here are the latest updates to these tools. For example:
Privacy improvements and better support for large screens, such as support for image drag and drop in WebView.
Custom Tabs now supports partial custom tabs.
Integrated features for PWA, like Richer Install UI and Play billing API in Trusted Web Activities.
Let’s dive in and learn more.

          <p>The new WebGPU API unlocks massive performance gains in graphics and machine learning workloads. This article explores how WebGPU is an improvement over the current solution of WebGL, with a sneak peek at future developments. But first, let’s provide some context for why WebGPU was developed.
# Context on WebGPU
WebGL landed in Chrome in 2011. By allowing web applications to take advantage of GPUs, WebGL enables amazing experiences on the web—from Google Earth, to interactive music videos, to 3D real-estate walkthroughs and more. WebGL was based on the OpenGL family of APIs first developed in 1992. That&#x27;s a long time ago! And you can imagine that GPU hardware has evolved significantly since that time.
To keep up with this evolution, a new breed of APIs were developed to more efficiently in…</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/shared-autofill/ target="_blank">Shared autofill across iframes: an initial proposal</a>
          <p>A proposal to allow autofill into a cross-origin iframe is available for testing. With this feature,
a parent frame can designate the frames whose fields should be autofillable. This is particularly
useful for payment forms, where it is very common for sensitive fields (for
PCI DSS
compliance) to be loaded from a third-party origin such as a payment service provider (PSP).
In the following example, the cardholder name and expiration date are in the top-level page (or main
frame), but the credit card number and verification code are in iframes from a PSP.


  Cardholder name:    
  Credit card number: 
  Expiration date:    
  CVC:       …</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/devtools-autofill/ target="_blank">Find form issues with Chrome DevTools</a>
          <p>In Chrome Canary we&#x27;re testing new features in DevTools that aim to help developers understand how
form Autofill works, and why it sometimes fails:
How does browser Autofill map stored values to form fields?
What criteria are used by Autofill to fill a form field?
Which fields didn&#x27;t get filled by Autofill?
Why does a form field not get filled by Autofill?
This article outlines the new features in Chrome DevTools, and explains how you can test them and
provide feedback.
  
  

# What is Autofill?
Chrome helps users manage address, payment and login information, by securely storing sets of data
and offering to fill in form fields without the user needing to enter text. That&#x27;s known as
Autofill.
Chrome offers to save Autofill data when you submit a form. On mobile:

# 1. WebGPU advances AI and machine learning in the browser
This newly-available API unlocks the power of GPU hardware, and makes the web truly AI-ready. In fact, ML libraries like Tensorflow.js run 100 times faster on WebGPU than regular JavaScript, and WebGPU runs 3 times faster than WebGL (the previous gold standard for web graphics). The fact that WebGPU runs on the device (rather than in the cloud) also helps developers to save money, decrease latency, and build new privacy-preserving…</p>

          <p>Do you ever feel like you&#x27;re not making progress towards your life goals? Maybe you&#x27;ve set a goal to exercise more, read more books, or learn a new skill, but you struggle to stay motivated and on track. If this sounds familiar, habit tracking can be a powerful tool to help you achieve your goals.
Notion is a versatile all-in-one workspace that can be customized to fit your specific needs. It&#x27;s a great platform for tracking your habits and progress towards your life goals.
Here&#x27;s an example of a Notion system for tracking life goals and habits that allows you to track your life goals and habits on a daily basis, and provides a weekly summary to help you identify trends and areas for improvement. You can customize the template to fit your specific goals and habits, adding or removing items as necessary.
Habit tracking in Notion has been a game-changer for me. It&#x27;s helped me stay accountable, build momentum, and ultimately achieve my goals. By tracking my habits, I&#x27;ve been able to identify areas for improvement and adjust my strategies accordingly.
In addition to habit tracking, Notion also offers other features that can help you achieve your life goals. You can create a vision board to visualize your goals, track your progress towards them, and even break them down into smaller, more manageable tasks.
If you&#x27;re looking for a way to achieve your life goals and build better habits, I highly recommend trying habit tracking in Notion. It&#x27;s a powerful tool that can help you stay motivated and on track.
Let me know if you have any questions or if you&#x27;ve found other helpful ways to track your life goals and habits!

          <p>The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in recent times has incited fear in many over losing their jobs. However, that shouldn’t be the case. On the contrary, AI is an opportunity to take your programming to the next level when used tactfully with the right knowledge, as we’ll cover today.</p>

          <p>Today we&#x27;re proud to announce the release of Carbon Control, an exciting new feature in Catchpoint WebPageTest.
Central to this new feature is the inclusion of a new  experimental metric in WebPageTest for measuring a website&#x27;s Carbon Footprint. Measuring carbon footprint has been the most requested and discussed issue in our tracker, and for good reasons: the web community is increasingly concerned about reducing our contributions to climate change, and companies will increasingly be held accountable for monitoring and reducing their emissions. At Catchpoint WebPageTest, we find this challenge worthy and interesting and we&#x27;re proud to contribute tools to the effort.
But Carbon Control goes farther than merely measuring your footprint... it allows you to take action! That&#x27;s where the &quot;cont…</p>

          <p>This article gives an overview of what’s new in WebDriver BiDi in 2023.
# What is WebDriver BiDi?
WebDriver is a browser automation protocol, defined as a W3C standard, with implementations in ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver, and WebKitDriver.
Chromium also has its own proprietary browser automation protocol: the Chrome DevTools Protocol, or CDP.
There are some fundamental differences between these two protocols: WebDriver is an interoperable standard, but the protocol is less efficient and lacks features that CDP has. In contrast, CDP is more efficient and powerful, but less interoperable.
That’s why in 2020, the W3C Browser Testing and Tools Working Group began work on WebDriver BiDi, a new standard browser automation protocol that bridges the gap between the WebDriver Classic and CDP protocol…</p>

          <p>I have a love-hate relationship with the hurdy-gurdy. While the haunting drone sound it produces is enchanting, it strikes me as something a medieval software engineer would conjure up so they could play the viola without actually knowing how to play the viola.
Drawing a bow is too difficult… let’s add a hand-cranked wheel
Fingering the strings is too difficult… let’s add some piano keys
Fiddles are too portable… let’s make it large and cumbersome
The “improvements” here create an object that couldn’t be more different in aesthetic and timbre than its relatives. One is sweet, nimble; it serenades. The other grinds like endlessly like a cat in a vice; a groaning wooden automaton.
As much as I dislike the hurdy-gurdy as a concept, history shows that the hurdy-gurdy democratized music and lowered the bar for people to create (loud) music. The hurdy-gurdy was widely used in churches before organs got popular. It stands to reason this mechanized monstrosity with push button keys was easier to popularize than it’s more technical stringed cousins.
As history progressed, the fiddle came back into the mainstream and orchestras ruled the mainstream for centuries… until the guitar.
There’s a metaphor in here about software engineering somewhere, I’m sure of it.</p>

          <p>Some major design decisions like type safety , rdbms and monorepo have seen trends transition in favor , against and back again.
What are some good examples of “big” design decisions that are hard to measure conclusively?
- type-safety (eg perl/python/php were first made popular by lacking it, and now we are returning to it)
- rdbms vs nosql
- monorepo vs microservices
Others ?
This isn’t about advocating . Let’s think about what other concepts are hard to reach a conclusion about and why measuring success can be difficult .

          <p>Designers use sticky menus (menus that stick to the edge of the viewport) to make them easy to access on long pages.
But this fancy pattern hurts UX far more than it improves it.
Here’s why:
Problem #1: They constantly take up space
They get in the way of the actual content. And it’s worse on small screens where space is more limited.
Semplice’s menu sticks to the top
	

Problem #2: They obscure content
For example, Material Design’s floating action button always gets in the way of the content behind it.
Material Design’s sticky button obscures the content beneath
	

Problem #3: They break when you zoom in
When zooming in, the size of the sticky menu can increase to a point where there’s little space for the content.
Medium’s website when zooming in and out shows how the content withint he…</p>

          <p>I&#x27;m looking for a single, solid UI/UX designer to work with me on my Tech Startup. Design is incredibly subjective, but there&#x27;s a sleek finesse to a lot of tech sites that really communicate a confidence and professionalism you don&#x27;t see often otherwise.
I&#x27;m talking about sites like Vercel, Stripe, Github (homepage), Gusto, Figma, Plaid, Podium, and so on.
How does one hire for that kind of thing. Does it really just boil down to finding designs you love and trying to poach? And how can one even know the personal contribution of a single designer when it could be diluted with a team?

          <p>Hey,
Spring and the caprioles of April’s weather here in Germany kept me so busy that I couldn’t send out a condensed edition earlier. We had a rainy month, and my split role of being a market gardener and web developer (currently working as a Scrum Master) is already challenging. But with unpredictable weather it gets even trickier. On the other hand, being in the garden calms me down, gives me back a lot of energy and happiness, and is a nice counterpart to sitting in front of a display doing virtual work.
If the Internet is to be a place for good, we all need to confront what it’s become.

# WebGPU is here.
WebGPU is a new API for the web, which exposes modern hardware capabilities and allows rendering and computation operations on a GPU, similar to Direct3D 12, Metal, and Vulkan.
Unlike the WebGL family of APIs, WebGPU offers access to more advanced GPU features and provides first-class support for general computations on the GPU.

# CSS
This release adds two new CSS features.
# CSS headline balancing
This feature provides a way to balance the length of lines in an element, for better readability and to minimize typographic orphans, for text that flows onto four lines or fewer. This is often useful for headlines. For example, the following CSS would balance all headline levels and blockquotes:
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, blockquote { 
 text-wrap: …</p>

          <p>I am looking for any insights or resources on best practices surrounding cli application design. There is a lot of variance out there in how tools use sub-commands, arguments, options, flags, etc. Some tools like git use nested sub-commands to distinguish between operations, while others like curl use options to accomplish the same purpose. Sometimes flags are mnemonic, but many times that&#x27;s not possible because of the sheer number of flags. Some tools keep &quot;long option&quot; names short (&quot;--list&quot;) while others may have multiple words (&quot;--list-software-updates&quot;). There&#x27;s more but, I&#x27;ll stop now to keep from rambling.
I did a cursory search and found a few seemingly universal guidelines, though none of them spoke to how arguments and options should be used.
* use stdout and stderr appropriately (i.e., don&#x27;t write messages to the user to stdout)
* use exit codes to indicate success / failure cases
* ensure output is consistent and easily parsed by other cli tools
What do you like? What do you hate? I would love to hear your thoughts on what style choices make for a more ergonomic cli tool.

          <p>For a long time, I have been wondering if there is a neat way to write UI declaratively for web apps for which SPA is not suitable.
One day two months ago, I got the idea that a CSS-like syntax would be nice, and started this project.
I&#x27;d like to hear what everyone has to say about it now since it&#x27;s practical enough to be introduced into another project of mine.
I personally think it might be worth using as an alternative to Next.js and other products that claim SSR, or as a modern jQuery in the sense that you can write UI in a declarative way.

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/background-blur/ target="_blank">Blur camera background</a>
          <p>Background blur is a popular function in modern video conferencing applications. It automatically distinguishes the background from the person in front of the camera, blurring the surroundings while maintaining the focus on the individual.
The Background Blur API brings background concealment capabilities to the web. This API makes it possible for web apps to ask the operating system to efficiently apply the background blur effect to a camera&#x27;s video feed. This eliminates the costly need for manual application of the effect through machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow.js, Mediapipe, or cloud-based solutions, which require processing each video frame individually.

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/av1/ target="_blank">Improved video calling with faster AV1 encoding</a>
          <p>Videoconferencing brings us together, even when we&#x27;re thousands of miles apart. Whether it&#x27;s catching up with your best friend, or having a quick meeting with a coworker, video calls have become an integral part of our lives.
State of the art video codecs such as AV1 can dramatically improve video call quality, while using less bandwidth to transmit higher quality video.  We&#x27;re now seeing AV1 hardware encoders in desktops and laptops, but what about users who have older devices?
The Chrome Open Media team has worked for the last 18 months to make the AV1 software encoder (libaom) much faster, unlocking better quality AV1 video calling on all devices. Chrome 113 includes libaom v3.6.0, which greatly improves real-time communications performance—both speed and quality—for speeds 6 through 10. In particular we added a &quot;Speed 10&quot; setting for devices with limited CPU capabilities.
Google Meet has tested AV1 successfully in extremely low bandwidth conditions—down to 40 kbps—which unlocks video calling to users whose poor Internet connections previously prevented them from making video calls.  Users with better Internet connectivity get improved video calls.  Compared to VP9 speed 7, AV1 Speed 10 provides 12% better quality at the same bandwidth, while running 25% faster on desktops.
The 3.6.0 release of libaom also includes improvements targeting screen sharing. Compared to VP9 speed 7, AV1 Speed 10 provides 45% better compression while running 35% faster.
Starting with Chrome 113 any WebRTC app can take advantage of these AV1 improvements.

Many thanks to the entire Chrome Open Media team for their work on AV1, especially Jerome Jiang, Marco Paniconi, Chi Yo Tsai, and Yunqing Wang.  Special thanks to Michael Horowitz from the Google Meet team.

If you’re filming something in public, it’s likely you’ll catch someone’s face who simply doesn’t want or need to be identified.

          <p>There are lots of areas where better web performance and reducing carbon emissions overlap: faster websites are often less carbon-intensive ones. They transfer less data, cache efficiently, and make fewer requests, all of which reduce energy consumption.
I’ve been consolidating a bunch of resources for an upcoming talk on Building a Greener Web. Here are a few resources you might find useful for building faster (and greener) websites.
Reducing the Site-Speed Impact of Third-Party Tags
An article by web performance consultant Andy Davies on the performance impact of third party scripts and tags, and what we can do to mitigate them. I’ve used many of the tips in the article, with very successful results.

How To Convert Variable TTF Font Files to WOFF2
Variable fonts can be great for performance. They enable us to load multiple weights and styles of a particular font from a single font file. Unfortunately a lot of them are only available as TTF files, which tend to be significantly larger than WOFF2, despite WOFF2 being well-supported. Henry DesRoches details how to use Google’s WOFF2 converter library to convert variable fonts from TTF to WOFF2.

Cache Control for Civilians
If, like me, your knowledge of caching is pretty minimal, you could do worse than check out this article on cache-control headers by Harry Roberts. You’ll soon know your no-cache from your must-revalidate.

          <p>Saw this on a HN topic: https://justsimply.dev/ and it reminded me of a work habit I had, and how I changed it.
It talks about how we should avoid using words like “simply” and “it’s simple” when talking to users. This reminded me of how I had no idea how impactful this word could be for users. I’ll add the word “don’t worry” here as well when referring to their issues.
I came to understand that they can come across as dismissive or condescending. Or, even worse, can make the person feel as though their problem is insignificant or that they are not intelligent enough to understand the solution.
To change this behaviour, I had a userscript that highlighted these words whenever I typed them, making me more aware of them and looking for ways to rewrite the sentence.
Can you think of a work habit you had that you wanted to change, and what steps you took to change it?

          <p>There are two things that almost every website does that just drive me nuts, and I don’t understand the reasoning that would lead to these designs.
1) Login link for existing users is tiny and hidden
Why?!? I get it, you want new users, but your existing users need to log in too!
2) auto play of video previews.
Netflix, YouTube, Etc… they all do it. I don’t want the movie to start because I clicked to read the full description, or worse on the main screen just because I stop navigating for a second to read the blurb. I don’t want videos in my suggested feed on YouTube to play silently and then start 20 or 30 seconds into the video once I do click them. Does ANYBODY find these useful?  Why are they the default behaviors? Who do they benefit? Don’t they just end up costing unnecessary bandwidth?  I know that I can usually turn them off, but having to search for the setting is frustrating.
…and don’t even get me started on form validators that are overly strict when they could just strip the unwanted delimiters or white space themselves, or password fields that cannot be pasted, or password rules that make it impossible to generate a random password.

          <p>One of my favorite ideas for Twitter was by Oliver Reichenstein in a post called “Make Bots Identifiable”. Oliver makes the case that apps should notify users if the author of the post is a feed, a bot, or an actual human and the UI of the application should reflect that accordingly. The example Oliver gives is setting bot text into monospace and giving it an obvious 🤖 icon.

It’s a simple premise: “make bots identifiable”. Think of how this would neuter Russian disinformation worldwide. It would expose the underbelly of buying bot followers, exposing fake influencers and hustlers as social and political frauds. This, of course, depends on social media companies running bot analysis on their users, which they’d never do because it would pollute the New Users Chart Goes Brrrr metrics that Wall Street loves.
On Mastodon, however, you can self-identify your account as a human or a bot. Not every feed/bot account does this and not every Mastodon client reflects this option in their UI, but one that does is Elk. Bots in the main feed get a small 🤖 icon, like in Oliver’s dream! I decided to use Arc’s Boosts feature to add some custom CSS to make the text monospace for an even more obvious effect.

/* Elk.zone */
div[flex]:has([i-mdi\:robot-outline]) .status-body {
  font-family: monospace;
}


The result is obvious and clear.

Simple selector, not the cleanest, but got to use :has(). It’d be nice if more Mastodon clients (or Twitter, or YouTube, or Twitch, or Bluesky, or whatever’s next) surfaced this kind of information in the main feed. Anyways…
Arc Boosts are cool 😎

          <p>Would love to share a new open-source project I&#x27;ve been working on - Runnable.
Runnable is a framework to build user-facing admin-like workflows with ease, while keeping operations internal. No need to setup REST or GraphQL for internal applications.
There are other similar tools out there that have comparable features, but Runnable is fully open-source and is much easier to set up (due to its simplicity). For example, it does not require a DB or even it&#x27;s own server. There is an option to use Runnable as a library or as a standalone web-socket server.
Site here: https://getrunnable.com/
You can demo Runnable here https://demo.getrunnable.com/admin/login and login with any Google creds.
Open to feedback and feature requests.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35714731 target="_blank">Show HN: A bespoke macOS UI for ChatGPT</a>
          <p>Hey! Alexis and Tobi here. We built a native macOS client for ChatGPT API that is free to use (macOS Ventura).
https://www.jamgpt.app/
We built and fine-tuned it to scratch our own specific text-processing itches, so we just wanted to share this with the community.
If you work with a lot of text or code like we do, check it out.
Its core features include:
- Instantly talk to ChatGPT from anywhere on your Mac by pressing a keyboard shortcut.
- Avoid typing out repetitive prompts by saving prompts and accessing them quickly.
- Just download and start typing as you would with ChatGPT. No need to learn anything new.
- Comes with both dark and light mode options
Batteries included: For the first 100 prompts, you can use our API key to try it out right away. After that, you can add your own OpenAI API key. The app is completely free to use and will remain so.
We may add additional pro features in the future, but we have no commercial intentions at the moment. Whatever you see now will remain free.
This is our first version, so things aren&#x27;t perfect yet, and some features might be missing.
Give it a spin and let’s talk! We’d love to hear your feedback.
Cheers! Tobi &amp; Alexis

          <p>It is said that it is better to find finding defects earlier in the process.
What is the most efficient way to do it?
Eliminate potential bugs in the program earlier in the process. i.e to avoid programming by coincidence
Anyone want to chip in ?

          <p>Today I fixed a couple little bugs and released a new version of my minimalist CSS framework. I built this to scratch my own itch and I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years as the starting point for most of my own websites.
I noticed I hadn&#x27;t shared this with HN for about 18 months (5 or 6 minor version changes) so I thought it might be okay to do that now.
Edit: Err, I missed a post from 7 months ago.

          <p>Source maps let you keep your code readable and debuggable even after you&#x27;ve combined and minified it, without impacting performance. To learn how source maps work, see the previous DevTools Tips video.
  
  

Watch this video to learn how to work with source maps in DevTools:
Enable source maps.
Use Developer Resources tab to check if source maps loaded successfully.
If required, load source maps manually.
Debug your (mapped) original code instead of deployed as you normally would.
Group the files you author to navigate the file tree in Sources easier.
To learn more, see:

# Use WebCodecs VideoFrame source in importExternalTexture()
WebGPU exposes an API to create opaque &quot;external texture&quot; objects from HTMLVideoElement through importExternalTexture(). You can use these objects to sample the video frames efficiently, potentially in a 0-copy way directly from the source YUV data.
However, the initial WebGPU specification does not allow creating GPUExternalTexture objects from WebCodecs VideoFrame objects. This capability is important for advanced video processing apps tha…</p>

          <p>CSS media queries are a powerful
tool that allow you to control the appearance of your website or web app based
on the device it is being viewed on. With media queries, you can create
different layouts for different screen sizes, orientations, and other factors.
The
update
media query gives you a way to adapt the UI to the refresh rate of a device. The
feature can report a value of fast, slow, or none which relates to the
capabilities of different devices..

# Devices and refresh rate
Most of the devices you design for are likely to have a fast refresh rate. This
includes desktops and most mobile devices.
You can query the device, see if it has a fast refresh rate for rendering
content, and style accordingly while still delivering a single stylesheet.
@media (update: fast) {
  /* computer screens, totally cool to animate */
}
eReaders, and devices such as low powered payment systems, may have a slow
refresh rate. Knowing that the device can’t handle animation or frequent
updates, means that you can save battery usage or faulty view updates.
@media (update: slow) {
  /* e-book readers or severely underpowered devices */
}
Lastly, there are scenarios like printed paper or e-ink displays that may only
offer a single render pass. Output like this cannot refresh at all, and is
referred to as none. It can be queried like this:
@media (update: none) {
  /* one time render like printed paper */
}
In the following CodePen, see a progressively enhanced hover animation using
this new update media query:

          <p>Today I&#x27;m going to share what I&#x27;ve learned over several years of using relational DBMSes (mostly Postgres). I&#x27;m probably not the first to agree on this, and there are probably people who disagree.
This is how I would build a social media app as an example. But it works for a wide variety applications, from social to money to inventory tracking, and it&#x27;s served me well each time.
1. Make each table a logical collection of events that have occurred, not objects or state. This is not CRUD. One row means one event, for example a table &#x60;react&#x60; means &quot;a user reacted to some post.&quot; Keep these events as close as possible to the end user&#x27;s intent.
2. Never delete or update rows as a way to record events. This would mean forgetting that something happened. Only do that for manual corrections or spec…</p>

          <p>You’ve landed the client, you’ve taken the brief, and you’ve created the most gorgeous, innovative, and on-trend website. Quite frankly, it simply rocks! But why isn’t it hitting the mark? The bounce rate is high and the time spent is lower than ideal.
It’s happened to the best of us, the design has led the project and now is time to investigate why it’s not delivering.
Your website design can be right on-trend and have all the hallmarks of a great site, but does it work functionally? Have you taken the time to get to know your users and what your client wants from them? Ultimately understanding your key users and responding to their needs and desires will lead to a site that is intuitive, logical, and delivers a user experience that will keep them coming back.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35683141 target="_blank">Ask HN: Design of Emacs type extensible editor based on electron?</a>
          <p>Please hear me out: Do not consider this as some unrealistic ambitious project that I am going to pursue. This is purely a thought experiment and design discussion on the feasibility of the idea that bothers me.
I use Emacs most of the time. I do consider it a great piece of software purely due to its extensible nature. I can go on about how Emacs is fabulous, but that is not the point here.
I use VSCODE too. And it is also a great text editor based on Electron.
Electron is a great framework too.
Most of us while doing software development, use a browser. Either for browsing documentation, finding answers, checking the meaning of the error messages, etc. We copy code from the editor, shell to the browser, and back to the editor, and shell.
Also using electron we can create almost any kind of desktop application. Currently what is happening is we create/ship the entire Chrome/JS run time to create an entirely new application for each specific case.
Now let&#x27;s try to put the pieces together.
Why can&#x27;t there be a single editor that has a similar extensible nature as emacs but uses JavaScript as the scripting language, and develop extension using HTML and CSS unlike only a text-based extension using elisp in emacs, so that we can leverage the Chrome runtime efficiently?
Why can&#x27;t we browse the web, edit text, and use the terminal all simultaneously?
Yes, anything is possible given that we solve the hurdles.
Based on your expertise and experience what challenges do you consider one may face during the design and implementation of these requirements?

          <p>With 2023 graphic design trends taking shape, one of the most popular trends we’re seeing is creative experimentation with Risoprint effects. Risograph printing, also known as ‘riso’ printing, is a unique printing process that has been around since the 1980s but has recently gained popularity among designers for its charming imperfections and vibrant colors. While traditionally used for zines and other print media, digital designers are now also experimenting with incorporating risoprint effects into their work to add a touch of retro charm.

          <p>Im back on an intentional job search and unfortunately started going back on linkedin just to get a wider exposure to job postings. 
Am somewhat surprised by this but linkedin website on mobile (not the app) does not seem to have any way to log out from the account. I looked for a couple minutes and couldn’t find anything so it’s possible I missed it - but nothing is obvious.
Additionally, the expected place one would look for such a “feature” is the top right of the page - and that’s where the mobile site puts the link to messages. So it seems to be kind of an intentional loop into getting Users to view messages rather than leaving.
Am somewhat dumbfounded by this but certainly seems like a dark pattern. Phuck you linkedin for this kind of stuff. I’ve always hated this platform and know others share similar feelings (and know there are advocates for it - fair enough).
My browser is set to not store cookies/cache anyway so after closing the mobile browser I was logged out. But good riddance.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35679935 target="_blank">I created a time-tracking tool that helped me improve my productivity with AI</a>
          <p>Hello Hacker News community,
I wanted to share with you a tool I created called MonitUp that has helped me improve my productivity by tracking my computer activities and providing weekly recommendations based on the data.
MonitUp tracks which apps and websites I use during the day, and based on that data, it offers recommendations on how I can better manage my time and be more productive. For example, it has suggested that I create a schedule for myself that includes time for work, rest, and leisure activities, and to prioritize my tasks so that I&#x27;m focusing on the most important ones first.
I created MonitUp because I was struggling with productivity and wanted a way to track my time and get recommendations on how to improve. It has been incredibly helpful for me, and I wanted to share it with the Hacker News community.
I&#x27;m not here to advertise my product, but rather to share my experience and offer a recommendation for anyone who is looking for a tool to help them improve their productivity. If you&#x27;re interested in trying MonitUp out, feel free to visit our website at https://timetracking.monitup.com/ and sign up for a free trial.
I&#x27;m also here to ask for feedback from the community. What do you think about MonitUp? What other features would you like to see? How can I improve the tool to better serve our users?
Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.
Best,
Faruk Durak

The “summary” element for showing/hiding details springs to mind. What else is there?

          <p>This is an interface on top of the OpenAI API for GPT-3 and 4. It looks similar to ChatGPT, but has a few more features.
It does require you to have an API key for the GPT API. The API key is stored in your browser local storage , but a hash of it is used to make sure your history is unique to you. The hash is stored in the backend.
There are two main reasons why I created this for myself, you also might find it useful:
- I would really wanted ChatGPT to have access get contents from websites
- I don&#x27;t like subscription fees and I don&#x27;t like how slow the free ChatGPT is, I like to pay-as-I-go, and GPT API already allows me to do that
P.S. There&#x27;s also a Chrome extension for summarising pages, but it&#x27;s my first time creating a Chrome extension. It&#x27;s ugly and buggy, and the slow review process of the Chrome web app developer  console doesn&#x27;t help.

          <p>Im unfamiliar with the visual UI design scene. 
What I’m looking for is the fastest way to prototype UIs for single page web apps. 
Right now I manually write them. I’m wondering if there is a visual design tool that exports human readable react code that you can then wire up with hooks etc. 
Thanks for the answers!

          <p>I even bought that course by that popular guy. CSS for JS developers that  could not help me because I could not help myself. CSS designs is just not for me no matter how hard I try.
I find web development to be mostly css(frontend) and if you lack css skills, you can&#x27;t be a good web developer.
failwindcss and bootcrap are no substitute for cs s according to the experts of industry.
How do I learn it? Is there a way out?

          <p>Doing a ton of classless CSS right now and plain vim is slowing me down little due to lack of WYSIWYG, which normally doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.
Is there a tool that lets me see my CSS in one pane and the rendered HTML file in another, such that if I tweak the CSS I can see the rendered changes live in the HTML? Bonus if Markdown is supported.

Let’s start fresh and move backwards. It’s been a rough couple weeks.
Thu: A woman with road rage threatened to shoot me in front of my kids on the way home from school.
Fri: Kids out of school
Sat: My dog died
Tue: Daughter came home from school with pink eye

Wed: Baseball game going to 10pm on a school night
Thu: Wife went to the ER at 8pm and got her appendix removed at 2am
That’s a lot to deal with on top of base levels of stress of launching a startup. Ironically, w…</p>

          <p>Users typically get apps, especially platform apps, through app stores, or through downloading a package and installing it. Today even the desktop experience is shifting towards offering apps in centralized stores.
For web apps the model is different: users don’t have to visit a centralized app depot to get a web app, by design, not all web experiences are installable, installing an app can differ between platforms and browsers, browsers even have different menus and surfaces to install the app. Once the user clicks on that install option the default dialog doesn’t include any extra information, as shown below:

          <p>Another day, another joycon (actually, these are pretty satisfying because people tend to want these to work).
I was expecting another mashed in shoulder button, but instead when I opened this joycon, I found the shoulder button entirely missing. Goodness knows where it went (it wasn&#x27;t inside the shell).
Replacing the button was straightforward, but annoyingly the placement was marginally off (by about 1.5mm) - which meant I needed to sand down the plastic of the trigger to allow for enough travel.</p>

          <p>I love these little cartridge based handhelds (apparently the smallest released). I&#x27;ve got a few that I&#x27;m working on repairing because they fail pretty hard when corrosion gets in there.
However, in this particular case, though it was sold as &quot;junk&quot;, only the left button on the dpad was failing. A good scrub with IPA and it was back working. Hugely simple compared to the ones with corrosion!</p>

Does anybody know if there&#x27;s a font awesome icon or HTML tags or legal guidance from creative commons that can be used as a canonical placeholder for publishing art or generated code or articles using AI. I could find stuff like this:

          <p>An excellent discussion on the explosion, or even, implosion, of AI and how it&#x27;s being tested and developed in public when the implications seem to have been swept aside in favour of the arms race between the big corps.
Policies and law haven&#x27;t been written and it&#x27;s the experts that don&#x27;t even have the confidence you&#x27;d hope to hear about:

50% of A.I. researchers believe there&#x27;s a 10% or greater chance that humans go extinct from our inability to control AI

Tristan Harris and Aza Raskin discuss the risk to society and how safety measures are far from adequate and laws need to be implemented.

When you invent a new technology, you uncover a new class of responsibilities

It&#x27;s a long watch at a little over an hour, but strongly recommend as we plough head long into a future where AI is inter-tangled with society.

          <p>I bought a joblot of Pebble watches a while back (only to secure a Pebble Round to gift to my mum), but it also included a Pebble Steel. Though the watched happily charged and turned on, when I unplugged the charging port, the watch immediately died.
When I got around to opening the watch (using the same screw bit for the classic) the lipo battery inside had … popped, I guess. It was bad.
Thankfully I found a few replacements on Ebay (as the batteries are particularly small) and with some careful soldering (to some very small solder point) and squeezing of wires to fit into such a tiny space, the Pebble Steel lives again. That&#x27;s 3 Pebbles I&#x27;ve revived in recent months - I&#x27;ve just got one Pebble Classic left to fix!</p>

      Writer &amp; Design Enthusiast 

As designers and teams, we all know the importance of having a solid brand identity consistently communicated across all touchpoints. But creating effective brand guidelines that are easy to follow (and maintain) can take time, and traditional methods, such as creating a PDF document, can be outdated and difficult to work with.
In this blog post, we’ll dive into the key elements that make the most successful brand guidelines and provide tips to create better ones. If you’re ready to upgrade your brand guidelines and creation process, let’s get started!

          <p># The birth of test automation
Let&#x27;s rewind back to the 1990s when the web browser was born. Test automation didn&#x27;t become a reality until the 2000s, with the emergence of Selenium and WebDriver projects to tackle cross-browser and multi-device testing challenges.
These two projects joined forces in 2011 as Selenium WebDriver and became a W3C standard in 2018. We usually refer to it as WebDriver or WebDriver “Classic”.
The evolution of the Selenium WebDriver project

Test automation prior to WebDriver “Classic” was quite tricky. Being able to automate browser testing significantly improved the quality of developers’ and testers’ lives.
# The rise of JavaScript
As web development evolved to rely more on JavaScript, new automation solutions such as WebdriverIO, Appium, Nightwatch, Protractor…</p>

          <p>I’m looking for screencasts on things like someone going about getting a problem and going through the whole process of a creating a solution. OO design, problem solving, coding it, testing it etc. Does such a thing exist? Sort of like Practical OO Design in Ruby in screencast form? Or even pairing sessions on a problem? More focussed on the thought process of the developer rather than learning a specific language or tool. Seems like there should be, but maybe I’m not looking in the right place!

          <p>Limited resources for research can cause missed opportunities and suboptimal solutions in product design.
AI can help designers overcome limited resources for research by providing quick and efficient access to data and insights.
Recognizing the potential to harness the vast knowledge available on the internet, I identified an opportunity in leveraging Language Models (LLMs) to create QoQo.
https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1189158575928509194/Q...
What can QoQo do?
QoQo offers a range of features to facilitate various aspects of design, including:

          <p>What’s the current state and future of work-from-anywhere, productivity devices for someone with poor vision?
I’m not talking about answering emails at the coffee shop with a laptop. I’m talking about hanging off a glacier in the sun, writing code.
And by poor vision, I mean, corrected, I can just about read a newspaper in poor lighting. I can’t see your laptop over your shoulder. You’ll need to jack up the font size, thanks. I’ve never understood shiny screens, it’s like a mirror to me.
I’m not worried about power supply, yet. The current state of batteries should be fine.
Also connectivity is not a problem, yet. I’ll tether my phone, or use some satellite service.
I appreciate that this is idealistic but bear with me. My dream life scenario is that I’m on some physical adventure/expedition, and suddenly we need some code to save our lives. (Anyone do this?)
So I need terminals, IDE’s, connectivity, text and voice based communication, GPT. All the good stuff. I don’t need high resolution or photo/video editing, yet.
Less ambitiously and more realistically, I’d like to work in my back garden when the sun is out.
I’ve always been on the fence about keyboards. I don’t like the rigid posture required but I have adapted to become an efficient user of this tool. And fixing the keyboard to the tiny screen (classic laptop) makes it worse. I’ve always thought we can do better.
Am I just looking for a rugged E-ink tablet?
I should also add, I’m super optimistic and re-energised about where the tech is headed with E-ink for displays and GPT for productivity. The opportunities feel liberating.
Thanks
