          <p>Hey, guys. I&#x27;ve just made a plugin which turns your pandas dataframe into a tableau-style component. It allows you to explore the dataframe with easy drag-and-drop UI.
You can use PyGWalker in Jupyter, Google Colab, or even Kaggle Notebook to easily explore your data and generate interactive visualizations.
PyGWalker (pronounced like &quot;Pig Walker&quot;, just for fun) is named as an abbreviation of &quot;Python binding of Graphic Walker&quot;.
Here are some links to check it out:
The Github Repo: https://github.com/Kanaries/pygwalker
Use PyGWalker in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/asmdef/pygwalker-test
Feedback and suggestions are appreciated! Please feel free to try it out and let me know what you think. Thanks for your support!

          <p>My wife and I did a poor job sharing Christmas wishlists with each other this year. It dawned on us how our hobbies (hers tennis, mine gunpla) are so specialized we either A) have the stuff we need or B) our needs are so specific or subjective that even gifting a ballpark guess of what the person wants doesn’t actually help and would probably create more work.
SungWon Cho (aka, ProZD) sums the situation up perfectly in his short bit “before and after you discover the subreddit for a hobby”…

The Reddit-ification of hobbies is real. Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok are waiting to rapture you and radicalize your innocent hobbies. And the more niche your needs become, the more expensive as well. The internet has obliterated the $20 casual gift. It’s $400+ or GTFO.
So we text each other links of an exact item, the stock counts of rare item across 20 sites, the exact time window the of the group buy, but ugchk, you’d need my login so that it’s tied to my account, so how about you just Venmo me $400 instead from our shared bank account?
We’ve cut the sails of gift giving. Online wishlists try to meet this need, but are always out of date, so you need to nudge the person to update their wishlist, spoiling the surprise, so that you can buy the first item at the top that meets your budget.
And the immediacy of Amazon Prime has ruined the suspense of gift giving. Why wait a month for something when I could have it in two days with free returns? The idea of a gift giving holiday reeks of an old world activity like reeling film through a projector to watch a movie with no sound. The immense effort for a demonstrative show of attention on a pre-planned day.
So that’s my take, the internet has ruined gift giving. The only safe gift going forward is homemade bread from your pandemic bread hobby. But be sure the yeast is single-sourced and stored at precisely 45ºF like its hometown in the mountains of Bavaria.</p>

          <p>It’s a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.
Read more about RSS Club.

I don’t talk about this much, but since February 24th, 2022 I’ve spent ~2hrs a day following the war in Ukraine. My heart breaks and sensitivities to injustice rise over this David vs. Goliath scenario where greedy authoritarians bomb peaceful civilians indiscriminately.
Ukraine has fought valiantly over the past year. Their cities and infrastructure decimated. Their homes and apartment complexes the targets of expensive cruise missiles. Mass devastation for what? The Russian government lies to its citizens and punishes them for seeking or speaking the truth. The government-sponsored media says its “necessary”, propaganda about “nazism”, manipulation over “satanism” and overt xenophobia, leaving yo…</p>

          <p>I had a free night on the calendar, so I tumbled out of my office with a stack of necessary supplies: a laptop in case I wanted to blog (or work more), my iPad in case I wanted to watch YouTubes, a gunpla set and all my tools in case I wanted to hobby, and a book or two in case I wanted to read. I got in the house and let out a sigh “What am I doing?!” I wish I could say this was an isolated event, but it happens often. The likelihood I do any of these activities beyond my iPad is miniscule.
Carrying that pile of distractions, my brain flashed back to college. Living in an enormous house with seven roommates and at least one freeloading vagrant, I was paying $200/mo in rent to sleep in a literal closet in South Austin. To focus, I’d leave the house and walk over to the coffee shop: Bouldin…</p>

          <p>Hi HN,
nudedisco is a simple album discovery tool I created to aggregate album reviews from a number of my favourite websites and blogs.
As someone who spends most of his professional life working with React and &quot;modern&quot; frontend stacks, it was a lot of fun to go back to basics and create a server-rendered website.
The site uses Elixir under the hood and is deployed to fly.io.
The code is available on my GitHub profile: https://github.com/soulprovidr/nudedisco
If you have any thoughts or suggestions, I&#x27;d love to hear them.
Thanks, and enjoy!

          <p>Hi HN. I&#x27;ve been working on a new browser-based design tool that&#x27;s ready for you to try.
The idea is you work on your design in low fidelity wireframes, while still getting a high fidelity output that you can share or use as a reference for your implementation. The way it works is by mapping low fidelity blocks you draw into high fidelity design system &amp; React components.
I spent several years working on design tools at companies like Airbnb, and I think the ideas behind many of the tools we built for designing at scale could really help startups and small teams as well. I would love any feedback you have!
PS: Most of Noya is open source at https://github.com/noya-app/noya

          <p>I am a big fan and user of Font Awesome icons. Although their search function is pretty neat, sometimes I find it difficult to search for icons related to a particular concept or topic.
As a solution, I have created an app where you can enter any concept or topic and receive the corresponding Font Awesome icon code. Here is an example for the word &quot;prediction&quot;:
When I searched for &quot;prediction&quot; using Font Awesome&#x27;s search, no icons were returned: https://fontawesome.com/search?q&#x3D;prediction&amp;o&#x3D;r
However, the app suggested that I should use the &quot;chart-line&quot; icon, which was accurate: https://cookup.ai/o/prediction-font-awesome-icon-picker-usin...
Please try it out and let me know your feedback.

          <p>In case you missed it, container queries landed in all stable browsers this week! It’s a pretty exciting time to be working with CSS, seeing this long-awaited feature finally become useable.
Una’s post on web.dev includes a rundown of how to use container queries, as well as some nifty demos. By coincidence, I’ve also been editing a soon-to-be-published article by Stephanie on container queries, which also includes some rather lovely demos. Something I’ve noticed about both sets of demos is that they make use of the resize CSS property to create a resizeable area within the document, rather than relying on the user having to resize their entire viewport to see the container queries in action.

          <a href=https://remysharp.com/til/javascript/use-effect-async-swallows target="_blank">React&#x27;s useEffect swallows async errors [til/javascript]</a>
          <p>I don&#x27;t particularly use this pattern, but I ran across it recently and it took me a while to work out what was happening (it does make sense if you think about it, but running through code it&#x27;s not easy to spot).
In the following example you won&#x27;t see any errors nor any logging.
useEffect(() &#x3D;&gt; {
  const test &#x3D; async &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {
    someFunctionThatThrows();
    console.log(&quot;sid&quot;);
  };

  try {
    test();
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(&quot;sam&quot;);
  }
}, []);

It needs to either change to to explicitly catches (which I tend to prefer because it feels explicit) or a try catch inside the async:
useEffect(() &#x3D;&gt; {
  const test &#x3D; async &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {
    try {
      someFunctionThatThrows();
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(e);
    }
    console.log(&quot;test has finished&quot;);
  };

  test();
}, []);

Or, which covers more cases:
useEffect(() &#x3D;&gt; {
  const test &#x3D; async &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {
    someFunctionThatThrows();
    console.log(&quot;test has finished&quot;);
  };

  test().catch(e &#x3D;&gt; console.error(e));
}, []);</p>

          <p>Hi HN, question in the subject really.
I am a former UI guy that moved out into a management role years ago, however I am hopping back in to manage the user experience with a fairly large and widely used application. I&#x27;ve kept my hand in with products like Adobe XD and Figma, however I&#x27;m curious to know what HN considers the go to tools are these days?
I have a fairly large job on my hands, the application has grown a little wild over the years, so need to bring it all into order.
Appreciate any advice you may have.

# Debugging HD color with the Styles pane
New CSS color types and spaces are coming to the web! It is equally exciting that DevTools introduced new tools to help developers create, convert and debug High Definition color.
The Styles pane now supports 12 new color spaces and 7 new gamuts as outlined in the CSS Color Level 4 specification. See High Definition CSS Color Guide for a comprehensive understanding of color options available on the web.
Here are examples of CSS color definitions with color(), lch(), oklab() and color-mix().

When using the color-mix() function, you can view the final color output in the Computed pane.

The color picker supports all the new color s…</p>

          <p>I frequently find myself in a cycle where I’m switching between phases of “Feature Work” and “Maintenance Work”. Sometimes the cycle is morning-to-afternoon, sometimes weekstart-to-weekend, sometimes week-to-week, sometimes month-to-month. I don’t think this is unique so much as I have noticed that these two different phases require different mindsets —an almost entirely different brain— and have different outcomes and rewards systems. I’ve tried to sum it up in this in a table.

Feature Work
Maintenance Work




Speed
Slower
Faster


Scope
Large-scale greenfield work
Isolated changes


Depth
Mostly deep work
Mostly shallow tasks


Quantity
Massive number of big changes and cascading issues
Many small changes

High, few stakeholders

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34800598 target="_blank">Ask HN: How do you maintain daily productivity in a non-structured setting?</a>
          <p>Suppose you are not in college or school with structured classes and exams or not in a typical job. Maybe you own your own business (whichever kind), or doing research in grad school, or some other thing where there is no external force to structure out your day.
How do you maintain productivity and get things done? How do you not wander off the internet rabbit hole? I am not talking about toxic patterns like studying 12 hrs a day and live streaming it. I am talking about getting real work done by working in a sane way.
Suppose you have taken a year break to prepare for some entrance exam and are self studying subjects on your own. Rather than sitting in front of your books all day and creating anxiety and bad habits (burning out), how do you manage to find time for all things in a healthy way and get things done in every aspect of life?

          <p>Hi! I&#x27;m currently writing UI test using selenium. 
Is there a product that can write UI test automatically just by &#x27;recording&#x27; what I&#x27;ve done in manual test? Like a macro recorder in excel.
I&#x27;m thinking like a browser extension then I can set a test scenario like this is for product checkout. Then I will click &#x27;record test&#x27; then I will proceed to do a manual test in checkout page until completion. Then I will stop &#x27;record test&#x27; and save it. 
Ofcourse it would be great If I can set predefined parameters for input.
I will add those recorded tests in our ci/cd pipeline and done.

          <p>In my RSS apps, the top HN feed has always shown a page with a link to view comments. Alas trying out Readwise Reader which is amazing but a bug where feeds like HN, DF etc go straight to the external url bypassing the commentary content which is why most of us subscribe to these wildly popular feeds. In meantime, is there a top HN rss feed that just includes the HN links and not the external links so will work in rss reader that can’t handle it normally yet?

          <p>Performance management processes have been different at every company I’ve worked in, ranging from “basically non-existent” at a 15 person startup to “months of work for managers each review period followed by clear expectations that growth feedback will be given throughout the year” in big tech world.  Some of these differences are good and bad, most are more about the context of the company.  I’ve found that regardless of process there are 4 things that it’s important for a team member to align with their manager on throughout the year.  Hopefully there’s process supporting this, but if not both the team member or the manager can take the initiative to make it happen.

          <a href=https://www.zachleat.com/web/chromium-missing/ target="_blank">&#x27;Could not find Chromium&#x27; with Puppeteer 19</a>
          <p>Kept seeing this error on my Netlify builds of the Speedlify project after upgrading to Puppeteer 19:
/opt/build/repo/node_modules/puppeteer-core/lib/cjs/puppeteer/node/ProductLauncher.js:127
Error: Could not find Chromium (rev. 1095492). This can occur if either
 1. you did not perform an installation before running the script (e.g. &#x60;npm install&#x60;) or
 2. your cache path is incorrectly configured (which is: /opt/buildhome/.cache/puppeteer).
For (2), check out our guide on configuring puppeteer at https://pptr.dev/guides/configuration.
With Puppeteer 19, the Chromium download has been moved to a new folder: ~/.cache/puppeteer (on Netlify this is /opt/buildhome/.cache/puppeteer/).
The problem here is that Puppeteer only downloads Chromium when it is installed and the folder it downloads to is outside of the expected and previously working folders that Netlify persists across builds (like node_modules).
The solution here is to either move this Chromium download folder to a location that does get persisted (via PUPPETEER_CACHE_DIR environment variable or a puppeteer.config.cjs config file) or persist it yourself via a Netlify build plugin.
I chose the latter. The netlify-plugin-cache build plugin will probably do this for you, but its so few lines of code that I used my own:
Expand to see the keep-data-cache Netlify build plugin
// speedlify/plugins/keep-data-cache/index.js
module.exports &#x3D; {
  async onPreBuild({ utils }) {
    await utils.cache.restore(&#x27;/opt/buildhome/.cache/puppeteer/&#x27;);
  },
  async onPostBuild({ utils }) {
    await utils.cache.save(&#x27;/opt/buildhome/.cache/puppeteer/&#x27;);
  }
};
which is referenced in my netlify.toml:
# netlify.toml
[[plugins]]
package &#x3D; &quot;./plugins/keep-data-cache&quot;
You can see this in action on the speedlify project.
After applying this change, make sure you force Netlify to reinstall your node_modules by clearing the build cache or changing a dependency version in your package.json.</p>

          <p>One day my friend Bryan told me to come look at something on his computer. I respected Bryan, he was a bit older, and his opinions always weighed heavily on me. This seemed urgent, so I shuffled in his office as quick as I could.
On the screen was a grey’ish looking website. Bryan made websites. I made websites. We had that in common. And playing guitar. He looked me in the eyes and said “This is Flex. It’s the future of websites and you need to learn it.”  And from what he was showing me, I was impressed and astounded. A fully rich internet application. XML-powered tables and lists with sorting and animations that you’d spend months building in Flash. I had never seen anything this professional before.

Flex was the successor to Flash. Or a better way to put it, Flex was Flash but for app…</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34767180 target="_blank">Ask HN: Is there an easy way to automate animation tests that include UI?</a>
          <p>Is there an (easy|simple|sane) [pick one from 3] way to automate animation tests that include User Interaction?
I ask because earlier this evening I deployed an update/NPM version bump of my Canvas library, after spending much of the day reviewing all the demo tests in various browsers on various devices. Only to watch as the new version broke the library&#x27;s associated website&#x27;s build tools. A stupid bug (2 chars) which meant having to fix it, test essential demos in various browsers etc before doing another release on GitHub and publishing the new version on NPM.
I know this process can be easier. But the thing that holds me back from automating the heck out of my test/release process is that I&#x27;m clueless about how to test the library&#x27;s functionality. It&#x27;s a library to make working with 2D Canvas elements &quot;more fun&quot;, so I test manually because I need to *see* that things - in particular animations - are working as I expect them to work.
The test suite is here: https://scrawl-v8.rikweb.org.uk/demo/index.html
Any advice is really welcome!

          <p>Like most people here, I&#x27;ve always worked with a computer in front of me. But I just had a dream that I was working while lying on my back, with my computer above me, screen looking down.
One could also imagine a setup where you&#x27;re lying on your side and facing a monitor, keyboard and mouse setup rotated 90 degrees, although how you would make the k+m stay in this position is the question.
Have you ever experimented with such unconventional work setups?

          <p>Performance management processes have been different at every company I’ve worked in, ranging from “basically non-existent” at a 15 person startup to “months of work for managers each review period followed by clear expectations that growth feedback will be given throughout the year” in big tech world.  Some of these differences are good and bad, most are more about the context of the company.  I’ve found that regardless of process there are 4 things that it’s important for a team member to align with their manager on throughout the year.  Hopefully there’s process supporting this, but if not both the team member or the manager can take the initiative to make it happen.

          <p>I have used rudimentary scrapers for years but always found that the process of training them doesn’t scale as well as I expect. In a scenario where one needs hundreds of scrapers all grabbing the same five or 10 pieces of information (dates, names, addresses, and ID numbers) is it possible to just grab the raw HTML and train an NLP model to find the relevant data rather than selecting specific selectors/paths?
It seems to me that finding these items in an HTML doc would be a trivial task for NLP and this would allow us to forgo scraper maintenance in the event that websites change. Assuming that I already have hundreds of thousands or millions of records in structured data that could be used for training, would modern tools make this a more efficient way of ingesting data?

          <p>Earlier this month, I got the chance to join Kevin Powell on his livestream to talk Web Components. Kevin is one of my favorite web development content creators. His style is approachable and beginner friendly. If you’re getting started with web development or want to improve your HTML and CSS chops, I highly recommend you like and subscribe.
Kevin is like other talented web developers I know; knows about Web Components but hasn’t dug in and used them yet. We follow my course guidebook, starting with HTML → moving on to CSS → and then start to get into JavaScript towards the end but we ran out of time to go super deep on that topic. If you liked this livestream or want to know more about writing Web Components or building systems with Web Components, there’s more in my Frontend Masters course.</p>

          <p>An unusually warm Texas January; 70ºF days, cool nights, my son had baseball try-outs, then…
On the last day of January, a horrific ice storm hit Central Texas. My house lost power and internet on Wednesday morning as thick tree limbs snapped under the weight of ice, taking out power lines and transformers on their journey to the ground. Hurricane-like devastation. We took refuge at a friend’s house who had power, then lost power, but had a backup generator. I went back and forth to the house to saw branches and sleep with the animals in our cold, powerless house. In total, 125 hours without power, beating out the previous record of 75 hours set in 2021.
Last week brought up a lot of trauma from the 2021 Freeze. My wife and I wonder how much of the off-grid prepper lifestyle we need to ado…</p>

          <a href=https://feedgrid.io/ target="_blank">Show HN: Feedgrid.io- RSS reader with a grid UI for serious infotainment junkies</a>
          <p>What:
Feedgrid is a news aggregator for RSS and Atom feeds.
It lets you organize your feeds into related topics and view feed items in 2-dimensional grids, rather than a single infinite scroll column.
The goal is to have a highly configurable tool to organize diverse feeds in a visual way, and then easily check for new content with a bird&#x27;s eye view.
Why:
- there’s a lot of stuff on the web, but you want it in 1 place, organized by categories that make sense to you
- RSS is nice in principle but most readers feel like an overloaded email inbox (i.e. kinda stressful—you already have other inboxes to deal with..)
- you like breadth-first search rather than depth-first search when you’re on the john and looking for some infotainment, but TikTok is frenetic and unsettling to you because you still like reading
How:
- we’re running a Django app with some minimal js in the frontend, and serve grid pages as a modest-sized html blob with enough content for one sitting, and offer old-school pagination to get more content
- the backend web scraping is entirely separate from the server, and uses scrapy. Scrapers are deployed on VMs, launching scrapy crawler instances dynamically based on feed SLA data in the db; there is no “scheduler”, but rather long-running parent coordinators launching child subprocesses as needed, so SLAs (and other attributes) can be modified by site admins without touching spiders

          <p>Hey HN,
I’d like to introduce, our app, Mockup - the ideal design tool for sketching and creating blueprints for apps or web designs.
One of my end goals is to make the design process easy and intuitive and that&#x27;s exactly what Mockup does with its 45+ templates, flexible canvas, Library to save your elements, and a range of other attributes. With features like the Lasso tool, text and image insertion, 4000 symbols from Apple&#x27;s SF Symbols library, and a customizable grid, your design possibilities are endless.
And, the best part? I&#x27;ve just released a brand new update, packed with features suggested by our users to make the design experience even better like arrange objects, copy &amp; paste, and an enhanced toolbar. Not to mention, users can now publish their elements to the community and access elements created by others as well as create UI  for TV apps with the highly requested newly added TV template.
I can&#x27;t wait for you to try it out!

Would love to hear your experience and how you&#x27;re using it in a work context. Most seem more oriented towards streaming (Twitch) and less about use for work. Or if you&#x27;ve seen any good articles/videos that&#x27;d be welcome too!

          <p>I&#x27;m a web developer who has been in the market for a new job for a while now.  As someone who has never enjoyed working with frontend JS frameworks (yes, I sucked it up and learned them and have worked with them professionally) I&#x27;m wondering who all the companies are who have embraced the semi-recent &quot;HTML over the wire&quot; movement (Can you imagine... using hyper text transfer protocol for transferring hyper text?  Seems nuts, I know).  It&#x27;s a massive slog shifting through endless React/Vue/etc-focused jobs out there.  Even if you use React in small areas where it pulls its weight but generally try and stick to simplicity of sending plain ol&#x27; HTML, I&#x27;d love to know who you are.  Even if you aren&#x27;t hiring, it&#x27;s nice knowing you&#x27;re out there fighting the good fight :)

          <p># Summary
This article is a deep dive into font fallbacks and the size-adjust, ascent-override, descent-override, and line-gap-override APIs. These APIs make it possible to use local fonts to create fallback font faces that closely or exactly match the dimensions of a web font. This reduces or eliminates layout shifts caused by font swapping.
If you’d prefer to skip reading this article, these are some of the tools that you can use to start using these APIs immediately:
Framework tools:
@next/font: Starting in Next 13, next/font automatically uses font metric overrides and size-adjust to provide matching font fallbacks.
@nuxtjs/fontaine: Starting in Nuxt 3, you can use nuxt/fontaine to automatically generate and insert matching font fallbacks into the stylesheets used by your Nuxt app.

          <p>In 1979, the page-a-day calendar was born. It’s basically a book on its side, but the user rips off a page each day. My friend Michael Cader took this concept and ran with it, creating calendars that sold millions of copies. Of course, everyone knows what day it is, and if you really need to […]</p>

          <p>I was curious how the layoffs over the last few months have impacted productivity. Google Trends shows that searches for &#x27;git rebase&#x27; have gone up over the last 12 months (https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date&#x3D;today%205-y&amp;geo&#x3D;US&amp;q&#x3D;git%20rebase). Quite significantly as compared to the year prior.
It&#x27;s a crude metric and probably actually measures activity vs productivity. So... has productivity / activity increased at your company over the last few months?

          <p>Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve made a chrome extension that makes designing and building Tailwind websites much simpler and faster.
It let&#x27;s you quickly tweak your website right inside the browser and copy back classes or html to your editor afterwards. As a developer who designs with code, I personally find it very useful in iterating on design quickly without any context switching.
Please give it a try and let me know what you think!

          <p>We recently wrote about the guiding principles that we’ve been using to help us make decisions about what improvements we want to make to WebPageTest.
One example of a feature that was driven by these principles are the Simple Test Configurations that we rolled out last January.

I wanted to walk through that change, why we made it, and what the results are because it’s a good example of how those principles guide our work and what goes into what, on the surface, was a very simple addition.
The historical default
Prior to adding our simple test configurations, the default test settings for WebPageTest were to run a test on
Chrome
On a Desktop
Over a Cable connection

Defaults matter a lot. As a result of this default, this test configuration was our most popular setting, accou…</p>

Lighthouse 10 is available immediately on the command line through npm, in Chrome Canary, and in PageSpeed Insights. It will land in Chrome stable in Chrome 112.
# Scoring changes
The venerable Time To Interactive (TTI) metric is being removed in Lighthouse 10, with its 10% score weight shifted to Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), which will now account for 25% of the overall performance score. Ideally this change will increase focus on CLS for sites that still need fixes for unnecessary layout shifts.
We expect this to improve most pages&#x27; performance scores, since most pages tend to score better on CLS than TTI. In an analysis of 13 million page loads …</p>

The Bidding and Auction services integrate with existing FLEDGE designs and offload bid computation and scoring to a cloud-based trusted execution environment. This was proposed back in 2022 and, after careful consideration, both Chrome and Android plan to provide support for Bidding and Auction services.
We will continue to support on-device auctions, and the use of the Bidding and Auction Services is not required unless it fits your use cases.

          <p>Lately I have been learning Jetpack Compose (for Android). Its new and shiny, like its counterpart SwiftUI (Apple), but there are older frameworks that take this approach, like React.
The main problem being solved, according to the marketing materials, is that its easier to keep state in sync with UI by regenerating the UI as state changes. Lots of work goes into avoiding updating the tree of UI that hasn&#x27;t changed. This sounds good.
Is the declarative approach the way forward for all 2d UIs (even outside mobile)? Is there still merit with the older approach of stateful widget trees and mutating their state imperatively? Where will we see the traditional (imperative) way maintain its niche compared to declarative UIs?

          <p>This is my fault for still using Chrome.
Today it auto-updated itself to the latest version (110), and in dark mode (windows 10)  on the url bar, when typing things into the urlbar, it no longer shows a blinking cursor if I type in anything resembling previous sites.

          <p>Since Stadia shut down, many feared that the controller would end up as a useless piece of hardware on the landfill. Luckily, the Stadia team has decided to instead open up the Stadia controller by providing a custom firmware that you can flash on your controller by going to the Stadia Bluetooth mode page. This makes your Stadia controller appear as a standard gamepad that you can connect to via USB cable or wirelessly via Bluetooth. Proudly featured on the Project Fugu API Showcase, the Stadia Bluetooth page itself uses WebHID and WebUSB, but this is not the topic of this article. In this post, I want to explain how you can talk to the Stadia controller via WebHID.

          <p>Geez, leave it to Patrick Brosset to talk CSS performance in the most approachable and practical way possible. Not that CSS is always what’s gunking up the speed, or even the lowest hanging fruit when it comes to improving …

          <a href=https://css-irl.info/testing-colour-accessibility-with-dev-tools/ target="_blank">Testing Colour Accessibility with Dev Tools</a>
          <p>I often use the WebAIM colour contrast checker to check my colours against WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards while building websites. Recently I noticed a handy feature in Firefox dev tools to make checking for sufficient colour contrast really easy.
If you inspect an element’s CSS in the dev tools inspector you’ll notice any colours are accompanied by a little colour swatch. Clicking on this brings up a colour picker — handy for trying out different colour options in the browser. For the color property, this colour picker also shows the contrast ratio of the text colour compared to the colour beneath (either the element’s background colour, or the background colour of an element beneath). It turns out Chrome has a very similar feature too. That’s super useful for experimenting with accessible colour combinations, without even leaving your browser tab!
Colour contrast simulator
Firefox has another useful feature for checking our colours are accessible: the colour contrast simulator. Found in the “Accessibility” tab in the dev tools panel, this feature simulates different colour vision deficiencies. Check out the full write-up.</p>

Add custom style to your picture-in-picture elements with the new :picture-in-picture pseudo class.
Set your web app launch behavior with launch_handler in your manifest.
use the credentialless attribute in iframes to embed third party content that doesn’t set a Cross Origin Embedder Policy
And there’s plenty more.

# :picture-in-picture pseudo class
With the picture in picture API websites can create a floating video window, always on top so that users continue consuming media, while interacting with other content.
Now with the :picture-in-picture css pseudo-class you can add styles to the elements to improve the experience.

          <p>This article introduces the Chrome UX Report (CrUX) History API endpoint, which provides time series of web performance data. This data updates weekly, and allows you to see about 6 months worth of history, with 25 data points spaced out by a week.
When used with the daily updates from the original CrUX API endpoint, you can now quickly see both the most recent data and what happened previously, making this a powerful tool for seeing webpage changes over time.
# Querying the daily CrUX API
To recap from a previous article on the CrUX API, you can get a snapshot of the field data for a particular origin in this way:
API_KEY&#x3D;&quot;[YOUR_API_KEY]&quot;
curl &quot;https://chromeuxreport.googleapis.com/v1/records:queryRecord?key&#x3D;$API_KEY&quot; --header &#x27;Content-Type: application/json&#x27; --data &#x27;{&quot;origin&quot;: &quot;https://w…</p>

          <p>Hey there hackernews!
I&#x27;m interested if any of you know some quality resources for learning software system design? But not a conventional, book/video/blog/course one. Maybe there is some kind of an interactive product that will help you build/learn system designs in an interactive manner?
Thanks in advance!

# Clearing Performance Panel on reload
The Performance panel now clears both the screenshot and trace when you click the Start profiling and reload page button.
Previously, the Performance panel displayed a timeline with screenshots from previous recordings. This made it difficult to see when the actual measurement started. The panel now always navigates to the about:blank page first to guarantee that the recording begins with a blank trace. This aligns with the Performance Insights panel which already did the same.

          <p>There have been a number of criticisms levied at the React project over the years, some of them handled and some of them still wavering in the wind. In this post, I’ll summarize the ones that are most prominent in my memory as a way of maintaining a record (primarily for my own use but maybe you’ll find it useful too). If you have others, please send them my way!

Researching the Performance costs of JavaScript MVC Frameworks—John Bender (December 12, 2014)
To my knowledge this was the first data-backed criticism of the SPA/clientside rendering model. It showed an average React performance baseline of 1.26 seconds to first render on a mobile device over 3G (prior to adding any application code).
The React popularization of client-side rendering did not exist in a vacuum. It …</p>

To these people, where did you learn? What resources did you use?

          <p>Hey everyone!
Today I’m launching Visulry, the first Figma based UI/UX only design service where you can request unlimited design help as a subscription.
Let’s say you have an idea that you need to turn into an app prototype, you need some extra flexible help with designing a new product, or re-design a web service from scratch then Visulry can be a good option.
I’m the sole designer of Visulry, so no outsourcing to other designers, which increases the reliability of the service.
If you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment.

          <p>For me it&#x27;s been Gitpod (https://gitpod.io). It&#x27;s like CI for development environments. It integrates with Git and lets me build my project continuously, and then create a containerized environment with the latest artifacts that I connect to with my IDE. I like it so much I decided to build a self-hosted alternative. It&#x27;s at https://hocus.dev if you want to check it out.

          <p>I like below applications from UI/UX perspective 
1. Canva.com -- Really makes designing graphics pretty easy and has a easy to use, intuitive UI
2. Trading view -- Shows the data heavy application in an easy way. No wonder it has become the go-to application for traders.      
Also what is final goal of UI/UX ? How would you measure UI/UX of an application.  Is it to look good ? Is it to have all the features ? Is it to help customer get the &quot;intended&quot; job done as quickly and efficiently as possible? Is it to be communicative ?

          <a href=https://navigator.designdisciplin.com/ target="_blank">Show HN: Design Navigator</a>
          <p>Hello HN!
Just shipped my first digital product, Design Navigator: https://navigator.designdisciplin.com/
I&#x27;ve been designing, studying design, and teaching design for many years. One of the biggest challenges I faced was how my profession is divided into different &quot;worlds&quot;. Designers employed at companies, freelancers, academics, creators... All seem to live in different worlds.
I developed Design Navigator to help designers choose their world and excel in it.
It starts with a simple questionnaire and recommends to you one of four worlds, along with a set of resources to dive deep: employment, freelancing, founder, and creator. Of course, the best way to use it is to check out all four of the &quot;worlds&quot;, get into some of the resources, and then make up your mind.
Built using Next.js, TailwindCSS, Vercel, etc. – nothing fancy from a tech standpoint. But I&#x27;m particularly proud of the front end design, wanted to show off some of my skills, and it was received well.
Over the years I&#x27;ve learned a lot from HN, and incorporated many YC resources into Design Navigator, especially for the Founder path. While it&#x27;s mainly intended for designers (and particularly UI, UX, web designers, etc.), I&#x27;m sure many of us in tech can find some inspiration in it. I hope you enjoy it!

          <p>Hi everyone,
I&#x27;m currently hosting a logo design contest on 99designs for my Shopify app, Delm Delivery Date Estimator.
I would really appreciate if you could take a moment to check out the designs and give me some feedback via the poll on 99designs.
The poll link is: https://en.99designs.de/contests/poll/4bc1cad60f
And for context here&#x27;s the app store listing: https://apps.shopify.com/delm
Thanks in advance!
PS: I understand the criticism aimed at 99designs, but participating in a design contest isn&#x27;t just about winning prize money. Designers know what they&#x27;re signing up for and can still benefit greatly from the experience. They have the chance to learn and improve their skills, and may even end up with a one-on-one client project as a result.

          <p>Personally, I often saw when visiting several companies that many developers were strongly dependent on ‘Spring’, which was always unfortunate.
Recently, I put together some materials for developers’ education, and I’ll post some of the contents here.
I would appreciate it if you could see this article as one of the ways even if it is obviously not the ideal solution.

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/web-share-api-in-third-party-iframes/ target="_blank">New requirements for the Web Share API in third-party iframes</a>
          <p>This article covers a potentially breaking change in the Web Share API. This change is already in
Firefox, will land in Chrome from version 110,
and is expected to land in
Safari soon.
The Web Share API allows you to share
text, URLs, or files. In its simplest form, the share code looks something like this:
try {
  await navigator.share({
    title: &#x27;Title&#x27;,
    text: &#x27;Text&#x27;,
    url: location.href,
  });
} catch (err) {
  console.error(&#x60;${err.name}: ${err.message}&#x60;);
}
If a sharing action needs to happen in a third-party iframe, a
recent spec change requires you to explicitly allow the
operation. Do this by adding an allow attribute
to the  tag with a value of web-share. This tells the browser that the embedding site allows the embedded
third-party iframe to trigger the share action.


  
    
Web Share in third-party iframes

  

You can see this in action in a demo on Glitch
and view the
source code.
Failing to provide the attribute will result in a NotAllowedError with the message
Failed to execute &#x27;share&#x27; on &#x27;Navigator&#x27;: Permission denied. This limitation was agreed by all
browser vendors to improve the privacy and security of users and to prevent bad actors, for example,
abusive ads, from triggering unexpected share actions.</p>

          <p>Episode 32: by Amy Ressler in Mountain View, USA (February, 2023)
Previous episodes
So you&#x27;ve just fixed a security bug in Chrome! Congratulations and thank you for making Chrome more secure for all users. But wait, your work is not done just yet. Only you can help mind the patch gap.
# What&#x27;s the patch gap?
The patch gap is the critical time between when you land the security fix and when the fix is shipped to users in a Stable channel update of Chrome.
When you land a fix in Chromium, that fix is publicly available to anyone that monitors our source code repositories—including bad actors and exploit brokers.
Bad actors work quickly to take advantage of that time between the landed changelist (CL) and users having access to that patch in a stable channel update, reverse engineering the CL…</p>

Part I: I’m Shadow Banned by DuckDuckGo (and Bing)
Part II: Updates on my Bing ban
Part III: My Bing Webmaster Guidelines Compliance Report
Today I bring good news: We solved the mystery! Bing now indexes my site and it shows up on DuckDuckGo… and it’s possible your site is showing up now too. What fixed it? Here’s what Microsoft/Bing told me a couple days after my post…
Thousands of small blogs were mistakenly marked as spam splogs. Wasn’t specific to yours.
Woah. It’s done. That’s it. I’m released from SEO jail. Thanos snapped. Temba, his arms wide. Jubilee.
This whole experience is a lot to digest, but I think there’s one important lesson here…

          <p>By productivity, I mean not only efficiency but also effectiveness.
I already went through GTD, to-do lists, and pomodoro techniques, so I would love to hear what worked best for you.
I returned to a simple to-do list on paper, my calendar, and a website blocker.

Unfortunately, we forgot to ask you where you are from, which, when it comes to pricing, matters. So, we&#x27;d like to ask you one more time: How much would you charge for iA Presenter in your country?

          <p>Last year, Interop 2022, a collaborative cross-browser initiative, was hugely successful in getting 15 key features implemented interoperably. As developers, we can enjoy the fruits of this collaboration, with features like container queries, cascade layers and dynamic viewport units going from little or no browser support to almost full support in the space of a year.
Interop 2023 has just been announced, expanding to 26 focus areas. Some exciting CSS features include the :has() pseudo-class, which is already supported in some browsers, as well as Level 4 media queries, math functions, and font palette features, which enable custom coloured fonts.

          <p>Feedback from websites currently participating in the Private Network Access from non-secure contexts deprecation trial has emphasized the difficulty in migrating affected websites to HTTPS. As a result, the trial is extended until Chrome 113 inclusive. Chrome 114, the first milestone without support for the trial, will roll out to Beta in early May 2023 and Stable in the end of May 2023.
A permission prompt will be built to allow mix-content requests from HTTPs public websites to plaintext private devices. For more information, please check the feature explainer for an overview and the developer walks through document to see developers&#x27; possible approaches need to achieve. We will put out a blog post with more details in the future once it is ready.
For further information, please see Private Network Access update: Introducing a deprecation trial.
If you host a website within a private network that expects requests from
public networks, we are interested in your feedback and use cases.
Let us know by filing an issue with Chromium at crbug.com and set
the component to Blink&gt;SecurityFeature&gt;CORS&gt;PrivateNetworkAccess or open an issue
in the Private Network Access WICG specification Github repository.

          <p>Before the Document Picture-in-Picture API, it was only possible to put an HTML  element into a Picture-in-Picture window. This new API makes it possible to open an always-on-top window that can be populated with arbitrary HTML content. It is available as an origin trial starting in Chrome 111 on desktop.
A Picture-in-Picture window created with the Document Picture-in-Picture API (demo).

The new API provides much more than is available from the existing Picture-in-Picture API for . For example, you can provide custom controls and inputs (for example, captions, playlists, time scrubber, liking and disliking videos) to improve the user&#x27;s Picture-in-Picture video player experience.

when I wrote the last summary right before the calm time between years, I thought the next edition will not feature a lot of articles. Since then, so many cool new notes and articles have been published that it’s about time to send this to you.
Personally, I’m working on two web projects at the moment with one being built from scratch with modern technologies and the other one being a quite tricky carry-all-components-over job from custom web components back to a theme library due to massive problems with the existing solution. In both projects the code I produce is nearly secondary and it’s more important to think about the issues in an abstract and unconventional ways, to make the right decisions for the software service, and maybe even more importantly, for the team.

          <p>Since its launch, the Core Web Vitals initiative has sought to measure the actual user experience of a website, rather than technical details behind how a website is created or loaded. The three Core Web Vitals metrics were created as user-centric metrics—an evolution over existing technical metrics such asDOMContentLoaded or load that measured timings that were often unrelated to how users perceived the performance of the page. Because of this, the technology used to build the site should not impact the scoring providing the site performs well.
The reality is always a little trickier than the ideal, and the popular Single Page Application architecture has never been fully supported by the Core Web Vitals metrics. Rather than loading distinct, individual web pages as the user navigates abo…</p>

          <p>What maker of cars is taking user experience seriously? It seems like the low-end of the market is missing must-have features/refinements (or are just ugly), but the high end of the market is all moving to touch screens with poor latency and bad and distracting software.
Which maker is refining the drive while addressing basic biological constraints seriously? (i.e. that we are humans, operating a heavy and fast machine in all kinds of complex environments)

Do you know any video player capable of this? I know you can reimplement the video API using WebCodecs, maybe someone already created what i am looking for.
The only open source project i found is this one:  https://github.com/MattiasBuelens/baby-video

I’ve always found opening apps from command line on Macs painful. You need to references the Applications directory, add .app to the name, etc. I just want to open apps by name. […]

          <p>Your website’s look and feel is just as important to your end user as its loading speed. Pairing great web design with performance ensures every site you build is both outstanding to the eye and seamless to use.
According to Think With Google, your website’s bounce rate can increase by 32% as page load time increases from one to three seconds. This emphasizes how crucial usability is to your website’s success: Without quality visuals and quick loading times, visitors simply won’t have the chance or patience to engage with your design.
While website imagery—such as product photos, artwork, or event videos—plays a big role in the story your web design relays to visitors, these visual elements have the potential to slow down your site if they’re not properly optimized. Follow these best pract…</p>

          <p>In this article we’ll walk through how to use Github Actions to automate regular deployment of a static site hosted on Netlify.
Why
This site (the one you’re reading right now) is a static site built with Eleventy. That means there’s no server building the pages on demand. Instead, every time I write a blog post in markdown and commit the file to the Github repository, the site is re-built — with Eleventy generating a static HTML page from my markdown file — and deployed on Netlify’s servers. Pretty cool, right?
In order to set up automated deployments you need to link your Github repository to your Netlify account, then configure your build settings — including the build command you want to use (e.g. npm run build), and the directory to publish from. This isn’t a tutorial on how to deploy…</p>

          <p>Last year I got into Gunpla, a hobby where you build little plastic model anime robots. What I like most about the hobby is that the models are “press-fit”, meaning you can build the entire model by pressing the parts together with your fingers. No gluing, no painting, just fingers. You can follow the directions and have a little plastic robot model in one sitting. That low-barrier of entry is a key part of what makes Gunpla fun.
Although tools are not required, a handful of tools improve the experience and output. As I’ve been progressing at Gunpla, my modest toolset has evolved. This post is a half “how it started / how it’s going” post about my Gunpla tools and half a reflection about tools in general. What are tools for? Why do we choose them? Are the more expensive tools worth it? Let…</p>

          <p>We&#x27;re happy to announce the addition of a new custom experiment in WebPageTest Pro! The new &quot;Edit Response HTML&quot; experiment is one of our most powerful yet, as it allows you to freely edit the initial HTML of a website and compare the performance of that edited version to the live website.
What&#x27;s it for?
The use cases for this experiment are infinite...
perhaps you&#x27;d like to test the performance impact of reordering some HTML elements in the head of a website to match the recommendations in Harry Roberts&#x27; excellent Get Your Head Straight guide...
or maybe you&#x27;d like to A/B test the addition of new section of your homepage...
or you&#x27;re curious see how much pageweight is saved by swapping out several images with verbose picture element markup.
Each of these situations would have been difficu…</p>

          <p>Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are web apps built and enhanced with modern APIs to deliver enhanced capabilities, reliability, and installability while reaching anyone, anywhere, on any device, all with a single codebase.
Watch the video to learn how to debug these apps with Chrome DevTools.


With DevTools, you can:
Inspect your app&#x27;s manifest file that makes your app installable. For example:

Check icons for different platforms.
Catch errors.
Configure a richer installation UI with description and screenshots.
Test service workers that act as proxies between your app and the network. For example:

Check worker registration.
Check worker versioning and activity.
Update worker version on reload.
Debug network connectivity by emulating offline mode or bypassing workers.
Test network messages.

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/css-color-mix/ target="_blank">CSS color-mix()</a>
          <p>The CSS color-mix()
function is shipping in Chrome 111. This post explains how you can use this
function to mix colors in your stylesheets.
Before color-mix(), to darken, lighten, or desaturate a color, developers used
CSS preprocessors or
calc() on color
channels.
.color-mixing-with-sass {
  /* Sass: equally mix red with white */
  --red-white-mix: color.mix(red, white);
}
Sass has done great
work staying ahead of the color CSS specification. There has not, however, been
a real way to mix colors in CSS. To get close you need to do math of partial
color values. Here&#x27;s a reduced example of how CSS may simulate mixing today:
.color-mixing-with-vanilla-css-before {
  --lightness: 50%;
  --red: hsl(0 50% var(--lightness));
  /* add &quot;white&quot; to red
     by adding 25% to the lightness channel
  *…</p>

          <p>It&#x27;s because Vercel has blocked my account under &quot;fair usage&quot;.
I had all of 12 hours on a Sunday to prevent people from using the source of the spike - but I suspect they would have blocked my account either way because normal traffic would have tipped me over their limits.

The trouble is that they&#x27;ve blocked my personal account and personal accounts can&#x27;t be upgraded to a paid account, you have to create a Team and then put your paid instances into the team, and of course that process is nowhere near as automated as their blocking process.
To be clear, a blocking process on a personal account results in landing on any of my projects returning a 422 - payment required and this:

          <p>We are creating some How-To Videos for Luro. Exciting to be at that point in product development, but it would be nice if our videos had captions from day one to set a precedent. We could pay to have them all transcribed, or pay for some automated caption service, or even upload them all to YouTube and get transcriptions once those finish processing… but ughck, those options are extra work and not “lean” in spirit.
That’s when we noticed Slack started adding transcriptions for any video we upload. We had transcriptions! In the spirit of patching the Web, I wrote a one-liner console script to yoink those VTT transcriptions from Slack for Web with a little URL hacking.
Find the uploaded video in Slack, click “View Transcript” in the caption below the video, then click the “Expand” button to see the video and the transcript side-by-side. Then put this in the console:

$(&#x27;video&#x27;).poster.split(&#x27;/&#x27;).slice(0,-1).join(&#x27;/&#x27;) + &#x27;/file.vtt&#x27;


⚠️ Warning: Auto-captions —what the deaf community lovingly refer to as “auto-craptions”— have limitations. For example, it transcribes our “Luro” as “Laura” and is entirely wrong and non-sensical at times. I point this out to show that you’ll need a human in the mix to proofread and fix captions. Be extra alert when dealing with technical content.
Anyways, hope this is helpful.</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34559063 target="_blank">Ask HN: Are PM/design specs usually lacking?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;ve been working as a software engineer for a little over half a decade (2 jobs).
In my experience, every time I get specifications from a product manager (PM) or mock ups from a designer, they are very vague and incomplete. When I&#x27;m told to implement things based on these specifications, I often find myself going back to them to get missing details and ask about use cases not covered. Sometimes, I&#x27;ll have partway implemented something only for the specs to suddenly change after asking about a different part!
I&#x27;m aware many jobs list working with PMs and UI/UX designers as a requirement, but it has gone past an acceptable level for me - I do not want to use the word &quot;incompetent&quot; to describe how I view their work output, but that is how I&#x27;ve slowly grown to feel about it.
So a few questions:
1. Are poor specifications a common occurrence in the industry?
2. Is there a way to improve the initial and ongoing quality of specifications as a non-PM and non-designer?
3. Should software engineers have a say in the specs or should they defer to PMs and designers and stick to technical implementation?
4. What kinds of places will give software engineers control over these specifications?
5. Is there a role which combines pm/designer/engineer into one?

          <p>I hope it&#x27;s not a too big can of worm I am opening here, and I can imagine it is quite subjective, but it would be nice to hear other people&#x27;s opinions about this.
I have programmed for quite a long time in both Python and Go and I also experimented with rewriting the same solution in each language - for smaller projects.
Performance Go of course beats Python in almost all aspects, but what about productivity?
My experience is in general Python is a lot more productive, with less code but if you don&#x27;t take care of keeping things well-organized then the productivity falls for bigger projects.
While on the other hand, Go seems to be more linear (similar) productivity even if you have a larger code base.
What is your experience with productivity, especially as the project matures?

          <p>I&#x27;ve been coming to Hacker News since 2005. Over that time it&#x27;s grown by many orders of magnitude.
The quality of the links has fluctuated but on the whole have stayed strong and, if anything, improved over time. I don&#x27;t know what the filtering process is but it works well - the articles feel pure and deeply interesting.
But the comments are trickier. As the size of the audience has grown, so have the number of comments. Which has the potential to be really interesting, except for the propensity of the UI to drive both readers and commenters deep into rabbitholes.
I used to love seeing the breadth of reactions to an article (or a new company). I could scan the comments to see what Hacker News thought. I quickly could get an idea of different perspectives and opinions. I could absorb the reaction of the Silicon Valley Coding Diaspora.
These days though it feels, at best, a deep, cloistered exploration of one POV, and at worst a triggered cascade of pedantry.
There are still amazing people and amazing observations in there. But they&#x27;re not easy to get to. There&#x27;s no easy way to scan the comments to get a sense of the breadth of reaction - it&#x27;s just a case of wading through all of them.
Back when I was in my 20s and soaking up everything I possibly could, I would happily invest that time. These days it doesn&#x27;t feel like such a good trade-off.
And I fear that in turn that penalises the potential breadth of reaction that this remarkable audience posesses. And reduces the participation of others who have less time - many of whom are more senior (decide for yourself whether you value that perspective).
If I could wave a wand, I&#x27;d love to see the threads collapsed by default. I feel like there are lot of potential UI wins that could further broaden engagement.
Would love to hear everyone else&#x27;s thoughts...
(Also... and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m thousandth person to ask this... how on earth is it that there is no dark mode to this dev-mecca?!)

          <p>Friday evening at 5pm on my way out of work I was about to push a feature fix up to add some encryption and decryption using crypto-js.  The API looks like this:

import CryptoJS from &#x27;crypto-js&#x27;

const encryptedThing &#x3D; CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(&quot;message&quot;, SECRET_KEY).toString()
const decryptedThing &#x3D; CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encryptedThing, SECRET_KEY).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8)


It’s an AES cipher block that puts a message in a cipher, and decrypts it on the other end. Cool. It uses math, like popular cryptographic technology Bitcoin, so you know it’s good.
As I was ready to push the code up, my tests were failing in the prepush hook. I knew the code was working but I’d have to appease Jest. Jest’s issue was it didn’t know about the import CryptoJS from &#x27;crypto-js&#x27; part because it only understa…</p>

          <p>Hi, I&#x27;m a web developer with several years of experience developing websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I´ve also developed several full stack applications with relatively complex backends (mainly Ruby/Ruby on Rails).
I&#x27;m currently on a teaching non-tenure track (teaching web technologies), which I love, but the pay in my country is very low.
I&#x27;m confident I have the creativity and formal knowledge to develop high quality static websites. So I&#x27;m looking for opportunities.
That said, I return to my initial question: is there still demand for semantic, performant, custom static websites?

          <p>Hi everyone,
I’m Joe, CTO at Dopt. We’re building a tool that lets you design user state machines with an SDK so that you can run them in your product.
We offer a React SDK that lets you create instances of those machines for any user of your product and exposes methods for transitioning the state of the user—effectively moving them through the machine. Dopt then acts as a persistence layer for the users’ machine state. We call our machines “flows”. Dopt lets you send in data about your users (identify calls/properties) and lets non-devs define rules based on that data for which users should enter the flows. Non-devs can also update content and other custom properties that can be referenced via the SDK.
For example, with Dopt’s SDK you can build:

          <p>By combining a couple of open-source projects, I created a simple, personalised solution for consuming your favourite RSS feeds via email. I built it for myself, but after a few tweaks, I opened up the repository for anyone with a GitHub account to fork or clone. To use it, just configure your own favourite RSS feeds, set up a cron schedule, and provide your own SMTP server.
The email can be fully customised and is made with this great new library: react-email. The project includes a development server, which you can run locally to test any tweaks you want to make to the email template.

          <p>In my 2023 review I mentioned that I wanted to give this site a revamp. This week I carved out some time to do just that. So, here it is: Welcome to the new and improved CSS { IRL }!
Design improvements
I felt like the previous UI was becoming a bit muddled as I added new features on an ad-hoc basis, without sitting down and committing to a plan. Also, I was just sick of looking at it! So this design is a bit more stripped back visually, without to many unnecessary flourishes, while still keeping some nice little touches, like animated underlines on hover. Other improvements include a better mobile experience (via the expanding/collapsing tag menu), and the ability to filter by category of post (currently “articles”, “notes” or “quick tips”, which I might add to over time).

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/longer-esw-lifetimes/ target="_blank">Longer extension service worker lifetimes</a>
          <p>Starting in Chrome 110 (in beta as of February 7, 2023), extension service workers stay alive as long as they&#x27;re receiving events. This corrects a timing problem in the previous implementation of extension service workers. It was possible for timeouts to occur when new events were in the event queue and for the timeouts to truncate asynchronous work. This improvement removes the hard five-minute maximum lifetime for extension service workers.
This article describes how these behaviors have changed.
# Background
Extension service workers mostly behave like web service workers, but in addition to service worker events, extension service workers can also listen to extension events. While normal service worker events extend the service worker&#x27;s lifetime, before the release of 110 only a few ex…</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/what-is-the-top-layer/ target="_blank">Meet the top layer: a solution to z-index:10000</a>
          <p>The top layer sits above its related document in the browser viewport, and each document has one associated top layer. This means that elements promoted to the top layer needn&#x27;t worry about z-index or DOM hierarchy. They also get a neat ::backdrop pseudo-element to play with. The Fullscreen API spec goes into more details as Fullscreen was a great example of the top layer in use before dialog support came along.
The top layer helps solve the problem of rendering content above the rest of the document.
The important things to remember:
Top layer is outside of the document flow.
z-index has no effect in the top layer.
Each element in the top layer has a styleable ::backdrop pseudo-element.
Each element and ::backdrop generates a new stacking context.
Elements in the top layer are stacked in …</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/scrollend-a-new-javascript-event/ target="_blank">Scrollend, a new JavaScript event</a>
          <p>Before the scrollend event, there was no reliable way to detect that a scroll
was complete. This meant that events would fire late or while a user&#x27;s finger
was still down on the screen. This unreliability in knowing when scroll has
actually ended, led to bugs and a poor experience for the user.
document.onscroll &#x3D; event &#x3D;&gt; {
  clearTimeout(window.scrollEndTimer)
  window.scrollEndTimer &#x3D; setTimeout(callback, 100)
}
The best this setTimeout() strategy can do is know if scroll has stopped for
100ms. This makes it more like a scroll has paused event, not a scroll has
ended event.
After the
scrollend
event, the browser does all this difficult evaluation for you.
document.onscrollend &#x3D; event &#x3D;&gt; {…}
That&#x27;s the good stuff. Perfectly timed and packed full of meaningful conditions
before emitting.

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/default-offline/ target="_blank">Basic offline page for web apps on Chrome Android</a>
          <p>Installed platform apps can be launched even when offline. In this situation they often include a page letting the user know internet access is not available. Some developers even create a full set of features that can be used while offline.
With web apps, the capability to work offline is more recent; it became possible with the launch of the Service Worker API. Also, when websites became installable, PWA added a requirement to register a service worker and implement its fetch() method in order for a web app to be installable.
The idea was to incentivize developers to provide their users at least a notice that the app couldn’t be used at the moment.
Now developers won’t need to do anything to get a default offline page. From Chrome 109 on Android, the browser will automatically generate a page that lets the user know when they are offline.
If the app doesn’t implement a custom offline experience, when the user is offline, the default offline page uses the app’s icon and simple You are offline message. Like the example below.
Visit this glitch to see the previous example in action.
The option to create your own custom offline page is still available. The following video demonstrates how to serve your custom page, using Workbox, with a single line of code.


Even though the feature is available on Android only at the moment, we are working to bring it to desktop as well. If you have any feedback send it our way via this form

          <p>To replace functionality in the transition from background pages to extension service workers, developers can use the chrome.offscreen API and manifest permission starting in Chrome 109. Requesting this permission allows for the creation of off-screen documents to use DOM APIs without obtrusively opening new windows or tabs that interrupt the user experience. The chrome.offscreen API documentation is now available in chrome extensions.
In Chromium, Manifest V3 extensions are service worker-based, but service workers don&#x27;t provide support for the same APIs and mechanisms that full document-based pages (which include background and event pages) do. Additionally, using content scripts to access DOM APIs on web pages leaves the extension at the mercy of different content security policies on a…</p>
