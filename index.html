          <p>Hello HN!
Just shipped my first digital product, Design Navigator: https://navigator.designdisciplin.com/
I&#x27;ve been designing, studying design, and teaching design for many years. One of the biggest challenges I faced was how my profession is divided into different &quot;worlds&quot;. Designers employed at companies, freelancers, academics, creators... All seem to live in different worlds.
I developed Design Navigator to help designers choose their world and excel in it.
It starts with a simple questionnaire and recommends to you one of four worlds, along with a set of resources to dive deep: employment, freelancing, founder, and creator. Of course, the best way to use it is to check out all four of the &quot;worlds&quot;, get into some of the resources, and then make up your mind.
Built using Next.js, TailwindCSS, Vercel, etc. – nothing fancy from a tech standpoint. But I&#x27;m particularly proud of the front end design, wanted to show off some of my skills, and it was received well.
Over the years I&#x27;ve learned a lot from HN, and incorporated many YC resources into Design Navigator, especially for the Founder path. While it&#x27;s mainly intended for designers (and particularly UI, UX, web designers, etc.), I&#x27;m sure many of us in tech can find some inspiration in it. I hope you enjoy it!

          <p>Hi everyone,
I&#x27;m currently hosting a logo design contest on 99designs for my Shopify app, Delm Delivery Date Estimator.
I would really appreciate if you could take a moment to check out the designs and give me some feedback via the poll on 99designs.
The poll link is: https://en.99designs.de/contests/poll/4bc1cad60f
And for context here&#x27;s the app store listing: https://apps.shopify.com/delm
Thanks in advance!
PS: I understand the criticism aimed at 99designs, but participating in a design contest isn&#x27;t just about winning prize money. Designers know what they&#x27;re signing up for and can still benefit greatly from the experience. They have the chance to learn and improve their skills, and may even end up with a one-on-one client project as a result.

          <p>Personally, I often saw when visiting several companies that many developers were strongly dependent on ‘Spring’, which was always unfortunate.
Recently, I put together some materials for developers’ education, and I’ll post some of the contents here.
I would appreciate it if you could see this article as one of the ways even if it is obviously not the ideal solution.

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/web-share-api-in-third-party-iframes/ target="_blank">New requirements for the Web Share API in third-party iframes</a>
          <p>This article covers a potentially breaking change in the Web Share API. This change is already in
Firefox, will land in Chrome from version 110,
and is expected to land in
Safari soon.
The Web Share API allows you to share
text, URLs, or files. In its simplest form, the share code looks something like this:
try {
  await navigator.share({
    title: &#x27;Title&#x27;,
    text: &#x27;Text&#x27;,
    url: location.href,
  });
} catch (err) {
  console.error(&#x60;${err.name}: ${err.message}&#x60;);
}
If a sharing action needs to happen in a third-party iframe, a
recent spec change requires you to explicitly allow the
operation. Do this by adding an allow attribute
to the  tag with a value of web-share. This tells the browser that the embedding site allows the embedded
third-party iframe to trigger the share action.


  
    
Web Share in third-party iframes

  

You can see this in action in a demo on Glitch
and view the
source code.
Failing to provide the attribute will result in a NotAllowedError with the message
Failed to execute &#x27;share&#x27; on &#x27;Navigator&#x27;: Permission denied. This limitation was agreed by all
browser vendors to improve the privacy and security of users and to prevent bad actors, for example,
abusive ads, from triggering unexpected share actions.</p>

          <p>Episode 32: by Amy Ressler in Mountain View, USA (February, 2023)
Previous episodes
So you&#x27;ve just fixed a security bug in Chrome! Congratulations and thank you for making Chrome more secure for all users. But wait, your work is not done just yet. Only you can help mind the patch gap.
# What&#x27;s the patch gap?
The patch gap is the critical time between when you land the security fix and when the fix is shipped to users in a Stable channel update of Chrome.
When you land a fix in Chromium, that fix is publicly available to anyone that monitors our source code repositories—including bad actors and exploit brokers.
Bad actors work quickly to take advantage of that time between the landed changelist (CL) and users having access to that patch in a stable channel update, reverse engineering the CL…</p>

Almost every single one looks about the same.
Don’t get me wrong, it’s not that I don’t like it because I do. it’s beautiful and minimal, but is it right to give Vercel the credits?
If not, where did it originate from?

          <p>This post is part of a series:
Part I: I’m Shadow Banned by DuckDuckGo (and Bing)
Part II: Updates on my Bing ban
Part III: My Bing Webmaster Guidelines Compliance Report
Today I bring good news: We solved the mystery! Bing now indexes my site and it shows up on DuckDuckGo… and it’s possible your site is showing up now too. What fixed it? Here’s what Microsoft/Bing told me a couple days after my post…
Thousands of small blogs were mistakenly marked as spam splogs. Wasn’t specific to yours.
Woah. It’s done. That’s it. I’m released from SEO jail. Thanos snapped. Temba, his arms wide. Jubilee.
This whole experience is a lot to digest, but I think there’s one important lesson here…

That’s it. That’s the biggest lesson. Blog your problems. When in doubt, blog it out. In my ex…</p>

I already went through GTD, to-do lists, and pomodoro techniques, so I would love to hear what worked best for you.
I returned to a simple to-do list on paper, my calendar, and a website blocker.

Unfortunately, we forgot to ask you where you are from, which, when it comes to pricing, matters. So, we&#x27;d like to ask you one more time: How much would you charge for iA Presenter in your country?

          <p>Last year, Interop 2022, a collaborative cross-browser initiative, was hugely successful in getting 15 key features implemented interoperably. As developers, we can enjoy the fruits of this collaboration, with features like container queries, cascade layers and dynamic viewport units going from little or no browser support to almost full support in the space of a year.
Interop 2023 has just been announced, expanding to 26 focus areas. Some exciting CSS features include the :has() pseudo-class, which is already supported in some browsers, as well as Level 4 media queries, math functions, and font palette features, which enable custom coloured fonts.

          <p>Before the Document Picture-in-Picture API, it was only possible to put an HTML  element into a Picture-in-Picture window. This new API makes it possible to open an always-on-top window that can be populated with arbitrary HTML content. It is available as an origin trial starting in Chrome 111 on desktop.
A Picture-in-Picture window created with the Document Picture-in-Picture API (demo).

The new API provides much more than is available from the existing Picture-in-Picture API for . For example, you can provide custom controls and inputs (for example, captions, playlists, time scrubber, liking and disliking videos) to improve the user&#x27;s Picture-in-Picture video player experience.

          <p>CSS color 4 brings a large set of tools and features to CSS for managing and
handling color. I&#x27;ve written the High Definition Color
Guide to cover all these new
features. In this guide you will learn:
What is a color gamut?
Human visual gamut.
What is a color space?
How to access more colors, new spaces, and debug results.
A review of the classic color spaces.
Meet the new web color spaces.
Color interpolation.
Gamut clamping.
Choosing a color space.
Migrating to HD CSS color.
Checking for gamut and color space support.
Debugging color with Chrome DevTools.
I hope this finds you well and answers all your color questions. 🙂</p>

when I wrote the last summary right before the calm time between years, I thought the next edition will not feature a lot of articles. Since then, so many cool new notes and articles have been published that it’s about time to send this to you.
Personally, I’m working on two web projects at the moment with one being built from scratch with modern technologies and the other one being a quite tricky carry-all-components-over job from custom web components back to a theme library due to massive problems with the existing solution. In both projects the code I produce is nearly secondary and it’s more important to think about the issues in an abstract and unconventional ways, to make the right decisions for the software service, and maybe even more importantly, for the team.

The three Core Web Vitals metrics were created as user-centric metrics—an evolution over existing technical metrics such asDOMContentLoaded or load that measured timings that were often unrelated to how users perceived the performance of the page. Because of this, the technology used to build the site should not impact the scoring providing the site performs well.
The reality is always a little trickier than the ideal, and the popular Single Page Application architecture has never been fully supported by the Core Web Vitals metrics. Rather than loading distinct, individual web pages as the user navigates abo…</p>

Which maker is refining the drive while addressing basic biological constraints seriously? (i.e. that we are humans, operating a heavy and fast machine in all kinds of complex environments)

          <p>I want to create a small web video editor, to be able to render video to a canvas without dropping frames i need a seekToNextFrame() function.
Do you know any video player capable of this? I know you can reimplement the video API using WebCodecs, maybe someone already created what i am looking for.
The only open source project i found is this one:  https://github.com/MattiasBuelens/baby-video

          <p>Your website’s look and feel is just as important to your end user as its loading speed. Pairing great web design with performance ensures every site you build is both outstanding to the eye and seamless to use.
According to Think With Google, your website’s bounce rate can increase by 32% as page load time increases from one to three seconds. This emphasizes how crucial usability is to your website’s success: Without quality visuals and quick loading times, visitors simply won’t have the chance or patience to engage with your design.
While website imagery—such as product photos, artwork, or event videos—plays a big role in the story your web design relays to visitors, these visual elements have the potential to slow down your site if they’re not properly optimized. Follow these best pract…</p>

          <p>In this article we’ll walk through how to use Github Actions to automate regular deployment of a static site hosted on Netlify.
Why
This site (the one you’re reading right now) is a static site built with Eleventy. That means there’s no server building the pages on demand. Instead, every time I write a blog post in markdown and commit the file to the Github repository, the site is re-built — with Eleventy generating a static HTML page from my markdown file — and deployed on Netlify’s servers. Pretty cool, right?
In order to set up automated deployments you need to link your Github repository to your Netlify account, then configure your build settings — including the build command you want to use (e.g. npm run build), and the directory to publish from. This isn’t a tutorial on how to deploy…</p>

          <p>Last year I got into Gunpla, a hobby where you build little plastic model anime robots. What I like most about the hobby is that the models are “press-fit”, meaning you can build the entire model by pressing the parts together with your fingers. No gluing, no painting, just fingers. You can follow the directions and have a little plastic robot model in one sitting. That low-barrier of entry is a key part of what makes Gunpla fun.
Although tools are not required, a handful of tools improve the experience and output. As I’ve been progressing at Gunpla, my modest toolset has evolved. This post is a half “how it started / how it’s going” post about my Gunpla tools and half a reflection about tools in general. What are tools for? Why do we choose them? Are the more expensive tools worth it? Let…</p>

          <p>Developers often feel discouraged from editing SVG markup and experimenting with SVG animations, thinking it’s a significant time investment or they need to use a complex animation library to do so. In this article, Adrian showcases his favorite tricks, which make the process streamlined and fun.</p>

          <p>When I was a child, I loved looking for Waldo in the “Where’s Waldo?” book series. These days I’m a sucker for TMZ’s “What’s the Big Frigin Difference” images, where TMZ slightly changes an image and you have to spot the differences between the two. That got me to thinking — how easily could I […]

The thinking goes that people are the ones who can solve problems, and more people give us more problem-solvers. This doesn’t hold up to a reductio ad […]</p>

          <p>We&#x27;re happy to announce the addition of a new custom experiment in WebPageTest Pro! The new &quot;Edit Response HTML&quot; experiment is one of our most powerful yet, as it allows you to freely edit the initial HTML of a website and compare the performance of that edited version to the live website.
What&#x27;s it for?
The use cases for this experiment are infinite...
perhaps you&#x27;d like to test the performance impact of reordering some HTML elements in the head of a website to match the recommendations in Harry Roberts&#x27; excellent Get Your Head Straight guide...
or maybe you&#x27;d like to A/B test the addition of new section of your homepage...
or you&#x27;re curious see how much pageweight is saved by swapping out several images with verbose picture element markup.

          <p>Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are web apps built and enhanced with modern APIs to deliver enhanced capabilities, reliability, and installability while reaching anyone, anywhere, on any device, all with a single codebase.
Watch the video to learn how to debug these apps with Chrome DevTools.


With DevTools, you can:
Inspect your app&#x27;s manifest file that makes your app installable. For example:

Check icons for different platforms.
Catch errors.
Configure a richer installation UI with description and screenshots.
Test service workers that act as proxies between your app and the network. For example:

Check worker registration.
Check worker versioning and activity.
Update worker version on reload.
Debug network connectivity by emulating offline mode or bypassing workers.
Test network messages.

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/css-color-mix/ target="_blank">CSS color-mix()</a>
          <p>The CSS color-mix()
function is shipping in Chrome 111. This post explains how you can use this
function to mix colors in your stylesheets.
Before color-mix(), to darken, lighten, or desaturate a color, developers used
CSS preprocessors or
calc() on color
channels.
.color-mixing-with-sass {
  /* Sass: equally mix red with white */
  --red-white-mix: color.mix(red, white);
}
Sass has done great
work staying ahead of the color CSS specification. There has not, however, been
a real way to mix colors in CSS. To get close you need to do math of partial
color values. Here&#x27;s a reduced example of how CSS may simulate mixing today:
.color-mixing-with-vanilla-css-before {
  --lightness: 50%;
  --red: hsl(0 50% var(--lightness));
  /* add &quot;white&quot; to red
     by adding 25% to the lightness channel
  *…</p>

          <p>It&#x27;s because Vercel has blocked my account under &quot;fair usage&quot;.
I had all of 12 hours on a Sunday to prevent people from using the source of the spike - but I suspect they would have blocked my account either way because normal traffic would have tipped me over their limits.

The trouble is that they&#x27;ve blocked my personal account and personal accounts can&#x27;t be upgraded to a paid account, you have to create a Team and then put your paid instances into the team, and of course that process is nowhere near as automated as their blocking process.
To be clear, a blocking process on a personal account results in landing on any of my projects returning a 422 - payment required and this:

          <p>We are creating some How-To Videos for Luro. Exciting to be at that point in product development, but it would be nice if our videos had captions from day one to set a precedent. We could pay to have them all transcribed, or pay for some automated caption service, or even upload them all to YouTube and get transcriptions once those finish processing… but ughck, those options are extra work and not “lean” in spirit.
That’s when we noticed Slack started adding transcriptions for any video we upload. We had transcriptions! In the spirit of patching the Web, I wrote a one-liner console script to yoink those VTT transcriptions from Slack for Web with a little URL hacking.
Find the uploaded video in Slack, click “View Transcript” in the caption below the video, then click the “Expand” button to see the video and the transcript side-by-side. Then put this in the console:

$(&#x27;video&#x27;).poster.split(&#x27;/&#x27;).slice(0,-1).join(&#x27;/&#x27;) + &#x27;/file.vtt&#x27;


⚠️ Warning: Auto-captions —what the deaf community lovingly refer to as “auto-craptions”— have limitations. For example, it transcribes our “Luro” as “Laura” and is entirely wrong and non-sensical at times. I point this out to show that you’ll need a human in the mix to proofread and fix captions. Be extra alert when dealing with technical content.
Anyways, hope this is helpful.</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34559063 target="_blank">Ask HN: Are PM/design specs usually lacking?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;ve been working as a software engineer for a little over half a decade (2 jobs).
In my experience, every time I get specifications from a product manager (PM) or mock ups from a designer, they are very vague and incomplete. When I&#x27;m told to implement things based on these specifications, I often find myself going back to them to get missing details and ask about use cases not covered. Sometimes, I&#x27;ll have partway implemented something only for the specs to suddenly change after asking about a different part!
I&#x27;m aware many jobs list working with PMs and UI/UX designers as a requirement, but it has gone past an acceptable level for me - I do not want to use the word &quot;incompetent&quot; to describe how I view their work output, but that is how I&#x27;ve slowly grown to feel about it.
So a few questions:
1. Are poor specifications a common occurrence in the industry?
2. Is there a way to improve the initial and ongoing quality of specifications as a non-PM and non-designer?
3. Should software engineers have a say in the specs or should they defer to PMs and designers and stick to technical implementation?
4. What kinds of places will give software engineers control over these specifications?
5. Is there a role which combines pm/designer/engineer into one?

          <p>And then what happens? Many small businesses start with generosity and good intent at their core. But it’s a rough ride, and especially when outside funding is involved, it’s easy to get seduced by the bright lights of Milton Friedman and an obsession with short-term profits. Over time, purpose starts to fade. The urgencies and […]</p>

          <p>I hope it&#x27;s not a too big can of worm I am opening here, and I can imagine it is quite subjective, but it would be nice to hear other people&#x27;s opinions about this.
I have programmed for quite a long time in both Python and Go and I also experimented with rewriting the same solution in each language - for smaller projects.
Performance Go of course beats Python in almost all aspects, but what about productivity?
My experience is in general Python is a lot more productive, with less code but if you don&#x27;t take care of keeping things well-organized then the productivity falls for bigger projects.
While on the other hand, Go seems to be more linear (similar) productivity even if you have a larger code base.
What is your experience with productivity, especially as the project matures?

          <p>I&#x27;ve been coming to Hacker News since 2005. Over that time it&#x27;s grown by many orders of magnitude.
The quality of the links has fluctuated but on the whole have stayed strong and, if anything, improved over time. I don&#x27;t know what the filtering process is but it works well - the articles feel pure and deeply interesting.
But the comments are trickier. As the size of the audience has grown, so have the number of comments. Which has the potential to be really interesting, except for the propensity of the UI to drive both readers and commenters deep into rabbitholes.
I used to love seeing the breadth of reactions to an article (or a new company). I could scan the comments to see what Hacker News thought. I quickly could get an idea of different perspectives and opinions. I could absorb the reaction of the Silicon Valley Coding Diaspora.
These days though it feels, at best, a deep, cloistered exploration of one POV, and at worst a triggered cascade of pedantry.
There are still amazing people and amazing observations in there. But they&#x27;re not easy to get to. There&#x27;s no easy way to scan the comments to get a sense of the breadth of reaction - it&#x27;s just a case of wading through all of them.
Back when I was in my 20s and soaking up everything I possibly could, I would happily invest that time. These days it doesn&#x27;t feel like such a good trade-off.
And I fear that in turn that penalises the potential breadth of reaction that this remarkable audience posesses. And reduces the participation of others who have less time - many of whom are more senior (decide for yourself whether you value that perspective).
If I could wave a wand, I&#x27;d love to see the threads collapsed by default. I feel like there are lot of potential UI wins that could further broaden engagement.
Would love to hear everyone else&#x27;s thoughts...
(Also... and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m thousandth person to ask this... how on earth is it that there is no dark mode to this dev-mecca?!)

          <p>Friday evening at 5pm on my way out of work I was about to push a feature fix up to add some encryption and decryption using crypto-js.  The API looks like this:

import CryptoJS from &#x27;crypto-js&#x27;

const encryptedThing &#x3D; CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(&quot;message&quot;, SECRET_KEY).toString()
const decryptedThing &#x3D; CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encryptedThing, SECRET_KEY).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8)


It’s an AES cipher block that puts a message in a cipher, and decrypts it on the other end. Cool. It uses math, like popular cryptographic technology Bitcoin, so you know it’s good.
As I was ready to push the code up, my tests were failing in the prepush hook. I knew the code was working but I’d have to appease Jest. Jest’s issue was it didn’t know about the import CryptoJS from &#x27;crypto-js&#x27; part because it only understa…</p>

          <p>Hi, I&#x27;m a web developer with several years of experience developing websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I´ve also developed several full stack applications with relatively complex backends (mainly Ruby/Ruby on Rails).
I&#x27;m currently on a teaching non-tenure track (teaching web technologies), which I love, but the pay in my country is very low.
I&#x27;m confident I have the creativity and formal knowledge to develop high quality static websites. So I&#x27;m looking for opportunities.
That said, I return to my initial question: is there still demand for semantic, performant, custom static websites?

          <p>Hi everyone,
I’m Joe, CTO at Dopt. We’re building a tool that lets you design user state machines with an SDK so that you can run them in your product.

Dopt lets you send in data about your users (identify calls/properties) and lets non-devs define rules based on that data for which users should enter the flows. Non-devs can also update content and other custom properties that can be referenced via the SDK.

          <p>By combining a couple of open-source projects, I created a simple, personalised solution for consuming your favourite RSS feeds via email. I built it for myself, but after a few tweaks, I opened up the repository for anyone with a GitHub account to fork or clone. To use it, just configure your own favourite RSS feeds, set up a cron schedule, and provide your own SMTP server.
The email can be fully customised and is made with this great new library: react-email. The project includes a development server, which you can run locally to test any tweaks you want to make to the email template.

          <p>In my 2023 review I mentioned that I wanted to give this site a revamp. This week I carved out some time to do just that. So, here it is: Welcome to the new and improved CSS { IRL }!
Design improvements
I felt like the previous UI was becoming a bit muddled as I added new features on an ad-hoc basis, without sitting down and committing to a plan. Also, I was just sick of looking at it! So this design is a bit more stripped back visually, without to many unnecessary flourishes, while still keeping some nice little touches, like animated underlines on hover. Other improvements include a better mobile experience (via the expanding/collapsing tag menu), and the ability to filter by category of post (currently “articles”, “notes” or “quick tips”, which I might add to over time).

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/longer-esw-lifetimes/ target="_blank">Longer extension service worker lifetimes</a>
          <p>Starting in Chrome 110 (in beta as of February 7, 2023), extension service workers stay alive as long as they&#x27;re receiving events. This corrects a timing problem in the previous implementation of extension service workers. It was possible for timeouts to occur when new events were in the event queue and for the timeouts to truncate asynchronous work. This improvement removes the hard five-minute maximum lifetime for extension service workers.
This article describes how these behaviors have changed.
# Background
Extension service workers mostly behave like web service workers, but in addition to service worker events, extension service workers can also listen to extension events. While normal service worker events extend the service worker&#x27;s lifetime, before the release of 110 only a few ex…</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/what-is-the-top-layer/ target="_blank">Meet the top layer: a solution to z-index:10000</a>
          <p>The top layer sits above its related document in the browser viewport, and each document has one associated top layer. This means that elements promoted to the top layer needn&#x27;t worry about z-index or DOM hierarchy. They also get a neat ::backdrop pseudo-element to play with. The Fullscreen API spec goes into more details as Fullscreen was a great example of the top layer in use before dialog support came along.
The top layer helps solve the problem of rendering content above the rest of the document.
The important things to remember:
Top layer is outside of the document flow.
z-index has no effect in the top layer.
Each element in the top layer has a styleable ::backdrop pseudo-element.
Each element and ::backdrop generates a new stacking context.
Elements in the top layer are stacked in …</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/scrollend-a-new-javascript-event/ target="_blank">Scrollend, a new JavaScript event</a>
          <p>Before the scrollend event, there was no reliable way to detect that a scroll
was complete. This meant that events would fire late or while a user&#x27;s finger
was still down on the screen. This unreliability in knowing when scroll has
actually ended, led to bugs and a poor experience for the user.
document.onscroll &#x3D; event &#x3D;&gt; {
  clearTimeout(window.scrollEndTimer)
  window.scrollEndTimer &#x3D; setTimeout(callback, 100)
}
The best this setTimeout() strategy can do is know if scroll has stopped for
100ms. This makes it more like a scroll has paused event, not a scroll has
ended event.
After the
scrollend
event, the browser does all this difficult evaluation for you.
document.onscrollend &#x3D; event &#x3D;&gt; {…}
That&#x27;s the good stuff. Perfectly timed and packed full of meaningful conditions
before emitting.

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/default-offline/ target="_blank">Basic offline page for web apps on Chrome Android</a>
          <p>Installed platform apps can be launched even when offline. In this situation they often include a page letting the user know internet access is not available. Some developers even create a full set of features that can be used while offline.
With web apps, the capability to work offline is more recent; it became possible with the launch of the Service Worker API. Also, when websites became installable, PWA added a requirement to register a service worker and implement its fetch() method in order for a web app to be installable.
The idea was to incentivize developers to provide their users at least a notice that the app couldn’t be used at the moment.
Now developers won’t need to do anything to get a default offline page. From Chrome 109 on Android, the browser will automatically generate a page that lets the user know when they are offline.
If the app doesn’t implement a custom offline experience, when the user is offline, the default offline page uses the app’s icon and simple You are offline message. Like the example below.
Visit this glitch to see the previous example in action.
The option to create your own custom offline page is still available. The following video demonstrates how to serve your custom page, using Workbox, with a single line of code.


Even though the feature is available on Android only at the moment, we are working to bring it to desktop as well. If you have any feedback send it our way via this form

Requesting this permission allows for the creation of off-screen documents to use DOM APIs without obtrusively opening new windows or tabs that interrupt the user experience. The chrome.offscreen API documentation is now available in chrome extensions.
In Chromium, Manifest V3 extensions are service worker-based, but service workers don&#x27;t provide support for the same APIs and mechanisms that full document-based pages (which include background and event pages) do.

          <p>2022 was a massive year for CSS. We got CSS Layers, more subgrid support, the impossible :has() selector, and WE GOT CONTAINER QUERIES! 🎉  Thank you to everyone who worked on those. A lot of the success for CSS this past year was due to an incredible cross-browser effort called Interop 2022, a loose agreement amongst browsers to try to work on some of the same features so feature support gaps between browsers are shorter.
I’m thankful for what we’ve gotten, but I don’t want to stop dreaming. I have no idea what’s in store for Interop 2023, but here’s my Top 5 short list of CSS features I want based on the work I do on a daily basis.

          <p>It will never let you down. Bitterness is never-ending, impenetrable and refuses to negotiate. If you give it a chance, it will persist. It lacks nuance or surprise. It’s simply a wall you can lean against, whenever you choose. Consistency is all it has to offer, actually.</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34448284 target="_blank">Ask HN: Help me re-find a small-scale water turbine design?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;m pretty sure I originally found this on HN some years ago, maybe someone here can help me find it again.
I remember a video of a very small hydro power demo, about a meter across, something along the lines of a gravitational water vortex power plant[0], but instead of the usual turbine they had a pretty big, uh, piece (&quot;runner&quot;?) in the middle of the chamber with the vortex, taking up most of the space. I believe the idea was to extract energy from very low flows. I seem to recall the people presenting it were Swiss, or something else vaguely germanic, but I&#x27;m not really sure.
Anyway, I&#x27;ve thought about this thing for years, decided to try to find it again, and mostly failed in my google-fu. I don&#x27;t remember anything of the specific language used to describe it, just the visual. If anyone knows good search terms for this, I&#x27;m happy to hear those as well.
Thanks!

          <p>Olivia Hoskin
      Writer &amp; Design Enthusiast 

Oh, what would we do without our trusty MCM? This graphic design trend took the world by storm post-WWII for a good reason. The clean and straightforward lines did a lot to inspire future trends, including the minimalist movement that so many designers are so fond of.
And although these designs definitely give off a “retro” vibe, mid-century modern elements in graphic design aren’t going anywhere any time soon. Playful, shape-based lettering is still prevalent throughout many modern designs, along with many geometric stylings.
In fact, the colors, more than anything else, tend to give most MCM graphic designs a “retro” feeling. Trade in the earthy browns, oranges, and greens for some greyscale and neons, and you have a more modern Mid-century Modern aesthetic that any Palm Springs resident would be ecstatic about.  ■

You need a library that is different from React, but similar enough that people might actually use it
You need say it’s “fast”
You need 10 influencers to get hyped about it because it’s “fast”
You need a CLI
You need a specialized linter/formatter
You need a build process
You need a custom file extension
You need components
You need types
You need local and global state management
You need a marketing site
You need a doc site
You need dark mode
You need a module system
You need a dark mode module
You need a router module
You need an auth module
You need an image module
You need a metaframework for “apps” but really it’s just to make the doc site
You need a specialized doc site generator that competes with the metaframework
You need your metaframework to have islands
You need your metaframework to do SSG/SSR/CSR/Universal/ISR/ODB/CDN delivery backed by edge functions
And you need to get VC funding to do all this and ultimately become a cloud hosting provider

          <a href=https://www.zachleat.com/web/open-source-friday/ target="_blank">GitHub’s Open Source Friday: WebC, The Web Components Framework</a>
          <p>I was on GitHub’s Open Source Friday to chat a bit about WebC and Eleventy.
I believe the full video will be posted to GitHub’s Open Source Friday playlist on YouTube at some point in the future, and when that happens I’ll circle back and post it here.

It’s safe to say it’s important to us that we do right by it and we have countless ideas for how to improve it and make it even more powerful.
But with so many decisions to be made, it’s important that we provide some sort of framework around how we think about the tool. All tools have opinions, whether or not they realize it.

          <p>The art of styling drop caps has been around for hundreds, if not thousands of years. Its use in print styles to signify the start of a new section or chapter can be seen through history. But, it&#x27;s always been problematic to style in the digital age. There hasn&#x27;t been a &quot;clean&quot; solution to styling them.
The CSS initial-letter property will make things much easier.
# Browser support
Where can you try initial-letter? It&#x27;s available in Safari and from Chrome 110. In Safari, the property needs the -webkit- prefix. There is an open issue for it to be implemented in Firefox.
There is also an open Chromium issue detailing the related properties initial-letter-align and initial-letter-wrap that are still to be implemented as per the CSSWG spec.
Test for initial-letter support with:

          <p>I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m design-blind. As long as something is functional, and I have an accurate conceptual model of how it works, I can deal with it. The important part (to me) is whether I can do the things I want done without the product getting in the way. For example, Jira does a terrible job of this, by getting in the way.
What I&#x27;ve come to realise is that this is only a small part of the picture. There&#x27;s a lot more that goes into design: a product helping you build an accurate model, showing you what&#x27;s possible, getting out of your way, and the emotional positive response because of the sheer attention to detail.
Recently reading Design of Everyday Things, and I _love_ it because it helped me formulate a model of what objectively good design looks like.
I read RefactoringUI as well, and this felt a lot more &#x27;here are some good rule of thumbs to follow&#x27;. Awesome, but I feel I&#x27;m still fumbling in the dark. I find myself falling back to these because I don&#x27;t know better.
So, do you have any tips or resources for helping improve design sense?

          <p>Yesterday I was going through all the links in BBC, CNN, Guardian RSS stored during time of pandemic, for research purposes. I downloaded archived RSS files in archive.org, like for http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml. Unfortunately I have noticed that some days are missing in the archive.org.
I think it is a good idea, if you have a favorite site, which has a RSS source, to make a call to store it regularly in archive.org for &#x27;the next generations&#x27;. https://help.archive.org/help/save-pages-in-the-wayback-machine/.
I have updated my RSS client to make a such call everyday, even for my fav YouTube RSS sources.
Even if &#x27;link rot&#x27; gets in a way, this might be insightful to see at least link, or title, or description of the RSS entry. Historians might consider it useful some day.

Edit: …and stay for some good news at the end.
Steps I’ve taken so far
Let’s look at what I’ve done and create a paper trail for our future selves:
I filed a Support Ticket (REQ00047859) with Bing
I verified my domain with Bing through a DNS record on Jan 7th, 2023
I fixed my  description crawl errors
I removed some extra whitespace before my 
I clicked every “Re-index” button in the site I could find

          <p>Do you find yourself needing to switch between development environments frequently? That&#x27;s often the case for me. I work on a web app for wind turbine operators, and I regularly need to test my front end code with different databases.
My colleague recently alerted me to .ENV Switcher, a VS Code extension that makes switching between different environments simple. Once installed, you need to create your different .env files (such as dev.env, release.env). Then you bring up a list of .env files to select from by clicking on a small button at the bottom of the window, and instantly switch to the desired environment. Nice!

          <p>Project Fugu is a cross company effort to close gaps in the web&#x27;s capabilities, enabling new classes
of applications to run on the web. More concretely, this means adding new APIs to browsers that app
developers can use to enable previously impossible use cases. What APIs does your browser of choice
support? What web applications make use of these APIs? Let&#x27;s find out!
# How Fugu is my browser?
Project Fugu APIs such as File Handling,
File System Access,
Async Clipboard, and Web Share
have brought capabilities to the web that you might expect only to be possible in platform-specific
apps. For example, you can now double-click an image file so it opens in an associated PWA, make
modifications, save the changes back to the file, and then copy the image contents over into another
app or share…</p>

          <p>Hey fellow Sheets lovers,
I recently wrote a blog post on different ways to sync Google Sheets with MongoDB, and thought it would be useful to lay out the key points here for anybody who is facing this problem!
The problem
G sheets is an incredibly popular way for business teams to interact with data. You can use Sheets for internal tools, BI, ad hoc analysis, you name it.
However, it&#x27;s extremely tricky to sync data between G sheets and NoSQL databases like MongoDB. This limits the usefulness of either tool.
So, what options are there? There are a few.
Method #1: Write your own script
You could build your own in-house solution using Google&#x27;s API and MongoDB change streams. Mongo&#x27;s change streams make it pretty easy to track events in MongoDB, but the Google API is trickier to work with. Fo…</p>

          <p>The other day I came across a pretty much textbook use case for container queries in the web app I was working on. We have this card component that displays a health summary for the section of the app the user is currently inspecting (which could be a wind turbine, a system within that turbine, or the entire wind farm). Generally we want to show that towards the top left of the screen, with some other information on the right. On certain pages however, the information on the right will be absent, so we want the health summary component to go full width. Easy enough, but we also want to style the component differently when it takes up the entire width by aligning the text to the left and giving it a more horizontal layout.

          <p>Hi HN,
Curious to know whether any of you have noticed significant improvements in developer productivity due to adapting a functional style of system building?
On the surface, it looks like FP will lead to a more modular and decomposed system, and hence would lead to greater re-usability and maintainability.
Moreover, if you have any thoughts/experiences on how adapting FP impacts a software dev team (or just individuals) currently operating in imperative style, please share your views.

          <p>Perhaps it’s a proprietary manufacturing technique, or the fact that you add a little chickpea flour to your dosa batter.

          <p>It came to my attention that my site does not appear on DuckDuckGo search results. Even when searching for “daverupert.com” directly. After some digging, DuckDuckGo used to get their site index from Yandex, but now gets their site index from Bing and sure enough… I didn’t appear on Bing either.
First of all… rude. I’m the one person I know who actually uses Bing and I started using DuckDuckGo on my Mac… and they have the audacity —nay, the cowardice!— to shadow ban me and my contributions to the Web!? I —a southern gentleman— take the highest offense at this slighting and misconstruing of my character. I do declare.
SEO isn’t one of my top objectives with this site, so initially I dismissed it. But that nerdsnipe shot a signal flare up in my brain that spun into mystery I needed to solve. …</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34383168 target="_blank">Ask HN: Are you glad you&#x27;re using Material UI (React library)?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;m normally someone who builds my core React components for a given project from scratch; it&#x27;s not hard and I have maximum control if needs change (and don&#x27;t have to go read a bunch of docs)
But right now I need to build a boring admin interface for somebody, with limited time to dedicate to it and it doesn&#x27;t matter what the look and feel is or anything. So I&#x27;m considering pulling in a library like MUI so I can more quickly just bang out an interface and move forward
Question is: does Material UI&#x27;s convenience outweigh the extra complexity of adding a dependency, reading its docs, learning its conventions, etc? Especially for a relatively quick and simple thing
(MUI-specific anecdotes only please; not interested in speculation or in discussions about the broader question of whether to add a dependency to a project)

          <a href=https://macaron.js.org/ target="_blank">Show HN: I made Macaron – Type-safe CSS-in-JS with zero-runtime and colocation</a>
          <p>Hey HN, my name is Mokshit and I&#x27;m really interested in web-performance and web-development. At the time of writing this, I&#x27;m a junior in high school.
Macaron is a typesafe CSS-in-JS library with zero runtime, colocation, maximum safety and productivity.
The motivation behind it is that runtime CSS-in-JS libraries, that is most of the CSS-in-JS libs, add alot of bloat to web apps and have a considerable performance drop with a bundle size increase. Alot of them also don&#x27;t support more performant ways of building web apps like streaming markup. Most of the current compile-time CSS-in-JS libraries try to fix this, but have some or the other drawback like not offering colocation, or not being type-safe.
Today, Macaron does all this with a compiler that extracts all the style declarations at compile-time and converts them to static css files while also letting you author the type-safe styles in the same file as your application code. It supports both - a vanilla styling API and a styled-component API with support for multiple frameworks like SolidJS and React and build tools like Vite and Esbuild. Macaron is currently missing a webpack plugin, but that will also be published soon, making it compatible with almost all bundlers.
There&#x27;s a ton of room for improvement in this space, and I feel like macaron is a step in that direction.

          <p>There are 3 primary reasons why one human may be more effective than another in a given work situation.
Caring - All things being equal, somebody who cares more about a problem / product will generally be more effective1.  Caring can range from “startup founder” level obsession to being completely checked out, and effectiveness will vary on that spectrum.
Capacity - The amount of time and mental resources a team member can bring to a problem matters and will vary over time.  Illness, stress, a busy personal season or competing work priorities can reduce this temporarily for anyone.  Some people will have longer term lower capacity than others due to factors like life circumstances, health, and outside of work commitments.
Leverage - People’s skills, experiences, tendencies, relationships a…</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/iframe-credentialless/ target="_blank">Iframe credentialless: Easily embed iframes in COEP environments</a>
          <p>Iframe credentialless is enabled by default from Chrome version 110. It solves the most common complaint developers working with Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP) have: embedding third-party iframes that do not set COEP.
It was previously available as an origin trial from version 106 to 108, and known as anonymous iframe.
# Why we need COEP
Some web APIs increase the risk of side-channel attacks such as Spectre. To mitigate that risk, browsers offer an opt-in-based isolated environment called cross-origin isolation, which requires deploying COEP. Cross-origin isolation allows websites to use privileged features including SharedArrayBuffer, performance.measureUserAgentSpecificMemory(), and high-precision timers with better resolution.
To enable cross-origin isolation, websites must send t…</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/cookie-max-age-expires/ target="_blank">Cookie Expires and Max-Age attributes now have upper limit</a>
          <p>As of Chrome release M104 (August
2022) cookies can no longer set an
expiration date more than 400 days in the future.
This change does not impact session cookies—cookies that do not explicitly set
an expiration date with Max-Age or Expires—as these are instead cleared when
the browsing session ends.
With this change, Chrome caps the expiration date to the maximum allowed value:
400 days from the time the cookie was set. Cookies that request an expiration
date further out than 400 days aren&#x27;t rejected; their expiration date is set to
400 days instead.
# Example
For example, consider a cookie set on Sunday, January 1, 2023:
Cookie
      Requested expiration
      Days in future
      Over 400 days?
      Effective expiration

Initial letters are large, decorative letters that have been used to start new sections of text since before the invention of printing.

I don&#x27;t want this: https://hnrss.org/frontpage because it show in my RSS feed two links to articles and comments. I just want feed of those articles with previews, just like other feeds that I&#x27;m used to subscribe.
Thanks.

# About SQLite
SQLite is a popular, open-source, lightweight,
embedded relational database management system. Many developers use it to store data in a
structured, easy-to-use manner. Because of its small size and low memory requirements, SQLite is
often leveraged as a database engine in mobile devices, desktop applications, and web browsers.
One of the key features of SQLite is that it is a serverless database, which means that it does not
require a separate server process to operate. Instead, the database is stored in a single file on
the user&#x27;s device, makin…</p>

          <p>Until now, setting the destination audio output device was only possible for  and  with HTMLMediaElement.setSinkId(). In Web Audio, AudioContext used the default device, leaving the user to change the system audio output device manually.
From Chrome 110, you can use AudioContext.setSinkId() to programmatically direct the audio output in Web Audio to any permitted device.
This is especially helpful in a variety of real-time communication scenarios. For example, a web app can use this to programmatically direct output to a specific audio output device such as a Bluetooth headset or speakerphone.

First, you need the identifier of the audio output device you want to use as a destination. Get the list of available media devices with naviga…</p>

          <p>I’ve been a full-time professional web developer for 17 years. In that time, I’ve seen things.
I remember when web browser developer tools were first introduced, using Firebug for the first time.
I predate even the WebKit mobile revolution: a time when proxy browsers reigned supreme and Blackberry was king.
I bore witness to the React schism, ruthlessly popularizing Single Page Apps and clientside rendering; giving rise to a slower web in the name of developer experience.
I embraced the npm revolution.
I rode the waves of Node.js.
I webpacked across The Great Divide.
The Great Divide #
The Great Divide really resonated with me. I keep coming back to it and I do think it continues to accurately describe what feels like two very distinct and separate camps of web developer.

          <p>I’ve come across several products that automatically convert Figma designs into code. From what I see, they do a good job of generating React components and CSS from Figma designs.
It seems to be that these should be the standard way to make frontends, but it is not. Why is that? Am I missing something?

          <p>As a software engineer, on my own I’ve been able to increase my efficiency and productivity at my current job over the years with the help of various programs such as command line interfaces (CLIs), GUI extensions (VS, VS Code, Chrome), software applications, and other shortcuts (aliases, etc.).  I know everyone has different preferences and work styles, but I can’t help but think what I’ve been able to apply would be useful for other developers at my company.
Undoubtedly, there are other developers at my company have their own set of programs/workflows they use to increase their efficiency that I think could be useful to me and others.
I&#x27;m curious to know what strategies other developers use or have used within their company to share productivity tips and programs with their colleagues. For example, is there a dedicated Teams/Slack channel, an internal wiki, or some other type of software where engineers can share/demo programs and shortcuts they use in their day-to-day work?

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34330134 target="_blank">Ask HN: Consolidated RSS feeds for independent blogs?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;ve been experimenting with a smart RSS reader and I&#x27;ve been using Superfeedr to ingest content.  Superfeedr monitors RSS feeds and calls a webhook when content arrives,  I stuff these into an Amazon SQS and then spool them out at my leisure.
My system requires a fairly high volume (1000&#x27;s of articles) to train a machine learning model so I have been focusing on high volume feeds like preprints from the arXiv,  news from the Guardian, etc.
Now Superfeedr charges 10¢ per feed per month,  my bill right now is $3 a month.  It&#x27;s reasonable that I can subscribe to about 100 feeds on Superfeedr but subscribing to 1000 feeds seems pricey to me.
There are a lot of independent blogs out there that publish an article every week or every six months.  What they all have in common is that somebody has to poll an RSS file many many many times per article ingested.  W/ superfeedr it makes for high costs but it is a hassle even if I built my own RSS ingest system.
One thing that would help would be consolidated RSS feeds that aggregate posts from a large number of blogs.  Are there good ones out there?  Are there other answers to problem of polling hundreds or thousands of independent blogs?

# Recorder: Copy as options for steps, in-page replay, step’s context menu
Open an existing user flow in the Recorder. Previously, when you replayed the user flow, DevTools would always start the replay by navigating to or reloading the page.
With the latest updates, the Recorder shows the navigation step separately. You can right-click and remove it to perform in-page replay!
Apart from that, you can right-click a step and copy it to the clipboard in the *Recorder panel instead of exporting the whole user flow. It works with extensions too. For example, try to copy a step as a Nightwatch Test script. With this feature, you can update any existing script with ease.

          <p>This one just happened to me, but it’s as old as they come. You click something, the interface registers the click (via an animation or sound or whatever), but then nothing happens. I hate that so much.

          <p>There&#x27;s a lot of great content on how to learn coding/CS from scratch but I don&#x27;t see much on how to learn how to design applications.

          <p>Hi.
I&#x27;m curious, how do you prefer consuming RSS news feed?
Do you prefer text-oriented News Aggregators like the HackerNews website or image-oriented ones with a small text/description layout?
Personally, reading small text only like HN page sometimes I feel there should be more customization to config view for user preferences, but I don&#x27;t need images preview out there.
What about you?

          <p>At one point during the construction of my house, we needed designs for the kitchen and bathroom cabinets and a bedroom wardrobe.
I wanted full control of the design process. Doing it in vector illustration software was too painful and it was taking too long. But I didn&#x27;t have the time to learn any complex CAD tool either.
So I developed a small HTML/JS/CSS tool for designing MDF furniture by writing my own little language that transpiles into a CSS grid layout.
Take a look at the blog post for details:

Or go directly to the tool (works best on desktop or tablet): https://alnvdl.github.io/squareplanner/

          <p>It’s a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.
Read more about RSS Club.

After a good long hem n’ haw about Texas politics my friend Daniel filled a conversational pause by jokingly asking…
“So what’s good?”
A question made in jest, but it has stuck in me like a knife. I now see my ability to complain everywhere. On the walk to school with neighbors they ask how it’s going, “Ughck. I’m busy”, or “Ughck. It’s hot”, or “Ughck. Kids putting on shoes, amirite?!”
I’m trying to figure this out. It’s starting to bother me because I don’t believe myself to be a negative or overly pessimistic person. But there are times I hear the vibe-killing “Debbie Downer” sludge pouring out of my mouth.
The best I can come up with is…
I think it’s easier to complain? My negativity bias bubbling to the surface. Is it easier for humans to commiserate on bad circumstances rather than celebrate good ones?
It’s an attempt to self-deprecate? Life is going good but I don’t want you to think it’s going too good.
My engineering brain? I spend every day finding and predicting problems, is my brain over-tuned to find problems?
Either that or I’m a big ol’ StrongSad. Hm.</p>

          <p>What - I am working on a specification/language which can describe a traditional system design process for web-services.
Why - Having a language for system-design will improve design interviews and system documentation. It can also give rise to &quot;Competitive Designing&quot; industry same as &quot;Competetive Programming&quot; exists currently.
How - I am exploring existing specs (Docker-compose, OpenAPI and UML) and a way to merge them. They will define the system.
For the actual execution, I will use the spec to setup a sandbox environments and run blank instances of services in them. Then I would use custom defined API flows from the spec to simulate an actually running system.
This is not the hard part. The hard part is finding a way to benchmark these API flows which gives reliable scores for the effectiveness of the system for a given problem and API flows.
Happy to discuss more.

I&#x27;ve been loosing weight successfully in the past but I have the impression it impacts my productivity and my mood: I get tired, I have low energy, even lethargic.
I want to remove the excess kgs again in next 6 months and would love to hear your hacks to dieting without loosing my positive energy.

I haven’t done a yearly review in a few years. Looking back at those old posts, it seems like I wrote some very bland listicles that wrapped up the different web development community work and side projects that happened during the year. This year I’m just gonna write free-form and see what happens 😅.
Open Source #
Probably the biggest news this year is that Eleventy graduated from side project to full time sponsorship (thank you Netlify!!) in February and everything changed.
Looking back at the before-times, I’m not sure how I managed this project without full time sponsorship.
The most important thing I’m doing in my life is being a dad. I’m reminded of the Jamstack Conf panel a few months back. The moderator asked panelists “What do you like to …</p>

          <p>Psst… I’ve been keeping a secret. As part of my Web Components course on Frontend Masters, I built an entire guidebook on how to get started with Web Components. A Web Components 101. I spent hundreds of hours preparing the materials for the course and I’m excited to announce that today I’m making the guidebook public for everyone to get started with Web Components.
Read the Guidebook
This guidebook is different! Most Web Component resources drop you right into the JavaScript parts. Ughck. That’s fine, I guess, but seeing the markup for a  component doesn’t make my heart or brain sing. It also doesn’t help me understand one of Web Components’ biggest mental hurdles: The Shadow DOM. To overcome this, I’ve intentionally designed my course to build out layer-by-layer from HTML→CSS→JavaScript, like how old timers learned the web development in the past.
Starting with  and  –and most certainly with Web Component styling– you become familiar with the quirks of Shadow DOM first before writing your own from scratch. Following the navigation from left-to-right you’ll learn the ins-and-outs of Using → Styling → Writing the different flavors of Web Components. And because it’s part of the Web Platform, that knowledge will always be valuable.
HTML-first may seem overly basic, but I find that lots of new and experienced developers alike have never even tried using a Web Component off the shelf. That’s my favorite part of Web Components! You can use lots of Web Components without a build process or any kind of Webpack sorcery. A script tag + HTML and you’re using them! Web Components make it easy to (dependably) use other people’s code.
You can of course still watch my Web Components course on Frontend Masters. I recommend it if you’re an visual or auditory learner like myself. There’s also a bit more back-and-forth with the live audience and their questions.</p>
