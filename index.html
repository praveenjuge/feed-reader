          <p>This is something I&#x27;ve been working on for a while. I&#x27;ve previously shared a video showing the designing and code exporting process of my web/mobile design tool[0]. I still felt at that point that there was a huge disconnect between development and design. I think I&#x27;ve solved that with these special components that allow:
- developers to build their logic using zero effort, placeholder UI
- designers to redesign these UI&#x27;s while testing their work in its final form, in the full context of the application
- developers to accept these ready-to-go designs in a way that doesn&#x27;t clutter the codebase
I oscillate between feeling ecstatic, because I feel like I&#x27;m on the edge of finally solving the back and forth handoff problem I&#x27;ve often dealt with, and some light despair, because I have a very small network (no decision makers) and would struggle to get something even perfect off the ground. I&#x27;m only saying this so someone reading is encouraged to either A) let me know that this is something they want or B) bring me back to reality, and explain why I&#x27;m wasting my time.
Cheers!

          <p>As a UX designer, your primary goal is to create seamless and user-friendly experiences. However, there’s one huge mistake that could cost you your job: listening only to your client.
No, wait, hear us out…
There is no denying that delivering what your client wants is important, as is client satisfaction. However, it’s crucial that you, as the UX designer, prioritize the needs and preferences of the end-users throughout the entire design process.
With an eye (and ear) only on your client’s direction, you can only be driven in one direction, the client’s vision. With a consistent eye on your user as well as an understanding of your client’s needs and purpose, you can act as a bridge between the client and end user.
In this blog post, we’ll explore how to avoid only listening to your client …</p>

          <p>Hey folks,
I&#x27;m super excited to announce the release of a new UI for Apache Kafka, Confluent, Redpanda and Kinesis that focuses on Teams and Data Mesh. (Note: the desktop version is also very popular with individual developers!)
Why is this important? Because providing a solution that can be used by both IT and business (non-technical) users is essential when building applications that process business data.
Of course, we are mainly developers working on Kadeck. So you won&#x27;t miss any of the features you need to troubleshoot and monitor Kafka and your applications. In fact, we have put a lot of effort into making Kadeck the best UI for Apache Kafka on the market. This includes enterprise features such as fine-grained rights management, topic organisation with data owners, labels and topic (API) documentation, teams and roles as well as LDAP/AD connectivity, data policies and masking, audit log and much more.
I hope you enjoy using Kadeck - either the free version or the Professional/Enterprise version - and please let me know your feedback. I always love to hear about your specific use case!
Have a great day,
Ben

          <p>Hey HN,
Constantly toggling viewport sizes the other day finally tipped my personal annoyance/action threshold.
The result is WINDED - a simple tool to help you simultaneously view how your website appears on different screen sizes without needing to constantly adjust the size of your browser window.
With a 4K monitor, you can see every Tailwind breakpoint on a single screen! This is game-changing.
Please let me know what you think!

          <p>I’m not talking about a canvas tag with some WebXR/WebGPU/WebGL. I’m talking about VR having it’s ‘world-wide web’ moment instead of headsets being expensive, digital walled gardens. Seems to me that VR headsets have eaten themselves already. For example, A common criticism of Apple Vision Pro is “What problem does this solve? What is the killer app?”. Before the world-wide web, I believe the home personal computer was primarily used for games, similar to VR right now.
Actual HTML is a poor fit for this solution. Our ‘document’ metaphor doesn’t really translate so well to virtual space unless we’re doing work designed for the space (like spreadsheets or code). In such a case, floating windows may be appropriate to replace modern desktops. Otherwise, I think we need a protocol and language of some kind to serve and describe virtual space, either from the headsets or larger infrastructure.
Is anyone working something like this?

          <p>I sometimes think of programmer productivity as being able to model as a Drake Equation:
how well you know a prog lang
Xhow concise or powerful that prog lang
Xhow well you know the editor/toolchain
Xhow powerful your machine
Xhow much/little interrupted
Xhow much/little distracted
Xhow many relevant &quot;variables&quot; &amp; constraint factors are fresh in your brain&#x27;s registers/caches
Xapplying lots of little &quot;best practices&quot; in your workflow
Xstimulant abuse (CAFFEINE, PEOPLE! CAFFEINE! sheesh)
anybody else? thoughts? better / more refined versions of this equation/mousetrap?

One such data manipulation is reversing arrays. You may want to reverse an array to show most recent transactions, or simple alphabetic sorting.

          <p>If you&#x27;ve ever played a full screen web game that popped up an in-game dialog
that you instinctively canceled with the Escape key, you probably found
yourself kicked out of full screen mode.
This frustrating experience is caused by the fact that dialog and full screen
mode &quot;fight&quot; for the Escape key. It&#x27;s an unequal battle because, by default,
full screen mode always wins. But how can you make the dialog the winner for the
Escape key? This is where the Keyboard Lock
API comes into play.

          <p>I&#x27;m currently a SWE working at FAANGMULA, feeling a bit burnt out and exploring other paths within tech. I&#x27;ve been paying much more attention to the design space in tech and have become enamored with the idea of learning how to create similarly beautiful experiences. I&#x27;ve been particularly inspired by Andrew Wilkinson/Metalab, Brian Chesky/AirBNB, Apple, Any Distance, Flighty, etc. As I pay more attention to high quality design and UX, I&#x27;m realizing that outstanding design in and of itself can be enough to launch successful and beautiful software.
I&#x27;ve been searching for high quality online education to study design in a more formal and rigorous manner, something equivalent to the MIT challenge, but all I&#x27;ve found are RISD&#x27;s online certificates which cost $10k, or youtuber/twitter influencer courses. I&#x27;m willing to pay the 10 grand for those courses, but if I&#x27;m going to spend that much I&#x27;d like some validation that its really worth it.
Primarily though, I&#x27;d love to hear from any designers here about how you learned and honed your craft.

          <a href=https://adamsilver.io/blog/the-problem-with-input-masks-and-what-to-do-instead/ target="_blank">The problem with input masks and what to do instead</a>
          <p>In 2010 I discovered input masks.
They seemed like a smart way to prevent errors. Because they help users follow a format. And they do so without taking up space.
But the truth is that this fancy pattern degrades UX.
Here’s why:
Problem #1: They’re confusing
For example, the cursor advances automatically to the next position. And placeholder characters can’t be deleted.

				
			Telephone input mask replacing characters and advancing to the next position automatically
	

Problem #2: They may be mistaken for an actual answer
This is because the mask looks like an input causing using to submit the form with errors.
Input masks make the input look like it’s been answered
	

Problem #3: They make the interface feel broken
This is because typing a restricted character gets ignored.

				
			Restricted characters get ignored without giving users any feedback
	

Problem #4: The format may be unfamiliar
For example, a phone number may require a country code which isn’t always expected and makes users work harder.
Input masks may use unfamiliar formats that don’t make sense to everyone
	

Problem #5: They’re misleading and verbose in screen readers
For example, they announce placeholder characters which aren’t part of the answer. And they don’t announce characters that were typed but ignored.

				
			Voiceover announces placeholder characters. And fails to announce characters that were typed but ignored.
	

What to do instead
Leave the input empty to make it obvious where the answer goes
Let users type what they like so the interface doesn’t feel unresponsive and broken
Allow multiple formats so users don’t have to fix something unnecessarily
Allow users to check their answers either on a separate page or just below the field</p>

Alex Hollendar and Jon Robson led the work and generously discussed the effort with us in a thorough, wide-ranging interview that covers the design, development, and processes that went into the project.</p>

# Improved debugging of missing stylesheets
DevTools gets a number of improvements to help you identify and debug issues with missing stylesheets faster:
The Sources &gt; Page tree now shows only the successfully deployed and loaded stylesheets to minimize confusion.
The Sources &gt; Editor now underlines and shows inline error tooltips next to failed @import, url(), and href statements.
The Console, in addition to links to failed requests, now provides links to the exact line that references a stylesheet that failed to load.
The Network panel consistently populates the Initiato…</p>

          <p>Most of the frameworks I used (svelte-kit/remix/nextjs) in IOS when navigating backwards either don&#x27;t show the previous page (especially if it was scrolled) or lose scroll position. (sometimes they work but not on every visit, some race condition or like exists)
Without a client router with native navigation, everything looks fine.

          <p>CNBC has a glaring CSS problem on certain viewports that produces no left-hand margin on their articles on my phone.
Example link: https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/21/intel-stock-drops-6percent-as-company-updates-chip-manufacturing-plans.html
I doubt most people with iOS would notice this, as I think it only affects certain resolutions.
It seems it might have something to do with the footer.
Hopefully they fix it.
It is annoying.

          <p>Humility, a designer’s essential value—that has a nice ring to it. What about humility, an office manager’s essential value? Or a dentist’s? Or a librarian’s? They all sound great. When humility is our guiding light, the path is always open for fulfillment, evolution, connection, and engagement. In this chapter, we’re going to talk about why.
That said, this is a book for designers, and to that end, I’d like to start with a story—well, a journey, really. It’s a personal one, and I’m going to make myself a bit vulnerable along the way. I call it:

The wgslLanguageFeatures member of the GPU object lists the names of supported WGSL language extensions.

          <p>The first few moves of a chess game give the player almost unlimited freedom. There are countless legal moves, and nothing to constrain the choices that a player makes among them. But as we add leverage to our culture and our organizations, the choices aren’t as easy. Jerry Garcia couldn’t easily change the Grateful Dead’s […]</p>

          <p>I’ve previously written about the problems with regular sticky menus.
In response to those issues, some people suggest showing and hiding the menu as the user scrolls up and down.

				
			Bondir’s sticky menu appears and disappears as the user scrolls
	

This seems smart because:
the menu gets out of the way to allow users to focus on the content
it allows users to access the menu without having to scroll back to the top
But this approach is worse than regular sticky menus.
Here’s why:
Problem #1: They’re distracting
This is because as the user scrolls the content to fit in the viewport, the menu will suddenly appear.
Good design doesn’t guess (wrongly) about what users need.
Problem #2: They’re hard to control
This is because scrolling up too much reveals the menu when it’s not wanted. And scrolling down a bit by accident will hide it when it is wanted.
Good design doesn’t take control away.
Problem #3: They cause dizziness and nausea
This is because animation can cause dizziness, nausea, headaches and more.
Good design avoids physical stress.
Problem #4: They can impact performance
This is because JavaScript is needed to react to the scroll event which can drain the battery and degrade performance especially on low-powered devices.
Good design is lightweight.
What to do instead
Keep pages short: Sticky menus are a symptom of long pages so fix the root cause.
Just let users scroll: It’s a myth that scrolling is a problem. Even on mobile, the top of the page is a flick or 2 away mostly.
Put relevant links in context: For example, add a subscribe form to the end of a post or add a CTA to a pricing section.
Use a back-to-top link: They’re relatively unobtrusive (but only do this once you exhaust the other options).</p>

          <p>I don&#x27;t even know where to start with this, but the UI/UX of Amazon Music is so incomprehensibly bad it&#x27;s hard to believe it wasn&#x27;t put together by first year interns. We&#x27;re led to believe that FAANG hires the best of the best minds but it&#x27;s increasingly obvious this can&#x27;t be the case anymore. A short list of my experiences:
* Infinite scroll is broken in the desktop browser. I can&#x27;t access songs in my library beyond the letter A. Why infinite scroll is needed here or anywhere for that matter is an entire discussion unto itself.
* Random music I&#x27;ve purchased is unavailable for streaming and has been reassigned to &quot;shuffle with other songs&quot; as I don&#x27;t subscribe to unlimited. I can still download the songs and listen to them locally however. To put it another way, some stuff I&#x27;ve purchased looks like I haven&#x27;t, perhaps in an attempt to get me to repurchase it.
* Accessing a 30 second sample of a song is hidden behind a mess of dark patterns. Scrolling in this UI is broken as well with overlapping layers hiding text and graphics. In fact the whole purchasing of music has been deliberately obfuscated likely to encourage streaming.
* Searching for music within your own library is nearly impossible.
I could go on and on about this but my experiences have been so bad I&#x27;m left speechless as to how this made it to production. As a highly experienced technical user I can&#x27;t help but feel how the average consumer forced to interact with this garbage feels.

          <p>Hi HN, this is a platform (Discuit, pronounced &quot;diskette&quot;) I&#x27;ve been working on for about two years. I initially built it for a niche demographic (my native country). But now with Reddit going dark and people looking for a new place to migrate to, I&#x27;m doing a quick launch today.
A few quick things:
1. I don&#x27;t believe federated platforms will ever become mainstream. They have a whole host of problems, not the least of which is that they&#x27;re too complicated for most people to use. This platform is not, therefore, federated.
2. I don&#x27;t know what the best way of monetizing a thing like this is. I see only two options: the Wikipedia model of running on donations, or being advertising supported (along with a paid ad-free tier). The Wikipedia model works quite well for small-scale and bandwidth li…</p>

          <p>Hey hacker news
I&#x27;m the founder and lead developer at Opine.cm, and we&#x27;ve just rolled out a new feature that hopefully will reduce the number iterations in your design or web-dev projects.
I&#x27;ve always been a big fan of checklists. When checklists were introduced to hospitals prior to surgeries, the number of complications and deaths dropped by 35%. I use them a lot personally - but I know many designers and devs find it too much effort.
The reality is, we easily forget verbal feedback; the humble to-do list solves this. We&#x27;ve just taken the added step of using AI to turn any video feedback that you get into a to-do list.
To try it for yourself
- Create an account at https://Opine.cm
- Record some feedback on the design examples
- Watch as the AI creates your to-do list.
Or here&#x27;s a demo
https://www.loom.com/share/e7a6ccd0df0b4dfb8552bd08c7c8ab56
(Quick note - The demo shows design work - but you can add also add websites in Opine.)

The technologist figures that a computer and more data might help, and the bureaucrat is looking for a system to put into place. If a lens is […]</p>

          <p>Through the little Etsy store I&#x27;ve got, I offer Game Boy game repair mostly just so I get to &quot;play&quot; on different problems, and a different problem did arrive.
This Game Boy Advance game, although worked, requires a battery for the real time clock aspects of the game (i.e. timed events). The problem was that there was a repair attempt that had taken off the entire pad for the battery, and in fact had go through the pad, through the silk screen and had gone all the way into the fibre glass insulation layer (you might be able to see in the photo the woven pattern).
Before slapping a battery on and jumping the positive leg to the right component, I wanted to check that nothing else was missing. Thankfully the community have tried to preserve a lot of the history (in this case, the PCB traces) but also published it freely on the web.
From this I also found a resistor had been lost in the previous repair. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s clear from my photo, but what I did was to bond the missing resistor in a completely different location (before it traces to a capacitor) and then use a jumper wire from the replaceable battery case. This was mostly in case the battery case was torn off again it wouldn&#x27;t cause damage to the components on the board.
Once that was all done, the game happily had its clock and was returned to it&#x27;s owner the same day.</p>

          <a href=https://www.visoid.com/ target="_blank">Show HN: Iterative architectural design using generative AI</a>
          <p>Hi everyone,
I&#x27;m Joachim, and together with my co-founder, we&#x27;re building Visoid - a tool for rendering architectural designs in an iterative manner.  We firmly believe that the future of this type of rendering, especially during the ideation stage of a project, will be heavily reliant on generative AI.
Traditionally, you would send your designs to a professional and potentially wait several days for the renders to be ready, all the while going back and forth with consultations. With Visoid, you can now receive instant, beautiful renders at a fraction of the cost.
Our platform is designed for architects and rendering professionals who work with visualizations of architectural designs. Visoid enables our users to iteratively modify the scene, materials, and elements in a sketch, 3D model or similar, controlled with a simple prompt.
We&#x27;re still in the early stages, and while the output isn&#x27;t always perfect, we&#x27;ve made significant strides in improving the quality and the control of the output images. We&#x27;re confident that it&#x27;s only a matter of time before we can consistently deliver higher quality images and with even more control.
We&#x27;re still figuring out how to fit this product into the workflow of our users and would love to get your feedback. I will try to answer any questions you have.
For more example images, have a look at our Instagram

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;36346043 target="_blank">Ask HN: How do you focus on productivity when working on the computer?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;m curious what methods people here use to avoid distractions when working on a computer. Obviously computers are excellent tools, but simply having access to an internet browser can be a gateway to a massive time sink.
Some things I have tried:
- Set up a Pi-Hole with distracting websites on the blacklist so the DNS requests do not resolve. I disabled this to dork around on the web today, so clearly not an effective commitment device.
- &quot;Cold Turkey Writer&quot; which locks down your PC giving only a text box essentially, until you write X words. I didn&#x27;t find this useful for my writing style since I tend to look up additional references/sources as I write, and losing access to that hurt my flow.
- Using a Raspberry Pi 4B as my desktop PC, with the idea being I couldn&#x27;t play games and YouTube isn&#x27;t entertaining when 30% of the frames are dropping. I ended up wasting a bunch of time messing with Linux trying to get stuff to work (oh Obsidian needs to be compiled and installed for ARM, oh there&#x27;s no Google Drive installer for Linux, let&#x27;s set up rclone, oh the audio driver broke). It was cool to have a fanless, low-power PC but I went back to my Windows desktop out of frustration and desire to have things &quot;just work&quot;.
Is it futile to use hardware/software to try and fix a self-discipline issue? What works for you?

          <p>Over a year ago, we
announced the Topics
API, a proposal for interest-based advertising. Topics is designed to enable websites to serve
relevant ads in a privacy-preserving manner, without resorting to covert tracking techniques, like
browser fingerprinting. Topics utilizes several techniques to preserve user privacy, including
reducing data, noising data, excluding potentially sensitive topics, and processing data on-device.
Combined, these changes make Topics a significant step forward
for user privacy compared to third-party cookies.
When we first offered Topics, we were clear that this was an initial proposal, and we asked the
ecosystem to provide input to help improve it. Since our announcement, we have been listening
carefully to their suggestions. Today, we&#x27;re excited to share some …</p>

          <p>As Eleventy continues forward on its mission to help super-fans of HTML quickly and easily build things for the web, as a responsible steward of the project I must disclose that we are no longer doing so with full time sponsorship. As such, Eleventy will be returning to its roots as a side-project and transitioning away from full time development.
Up front, I do want to make a few things clear:
No action is required by folks building with Eleventy. Eleventy has always been independently bootstrapped and it is not changing ownership/stewardship. We march on independently as before.
We are thankful for the year of full time development and maintenance donated to the project by Netlify and I’m proud of the things we shipped in that time: including but not limited to the stable 2.0 release.

What is Spatial UI?
Spatial UI, also known as spatial user interface, refers to a type of UI design that leverages spatial and immersive technologies to enable users to interact with digital content in a three-dimensional space. It creates an interface that mimics the physical world, allowing users to interact with digital objects and environments using natural gestures, movements, and spatial awareness.

          <p>It&#x27;s our biggest open source icon set ever with 4,000 icons in four styles: Line/Solid/Duo/Flat
Core is like the Helvetica of icons. Neutral and versatile. Built on a tiny 14px grid for maximum legibility.
Currently, it&#x27;s available on Figma but we&#x27;re working to add it to our web app, desktop app, and GitHub.

          <a href=https://app.theapricot.io/ target="_blank">Show HN: Apricot – because RSS won&#x27;t come back unless we move it forward</a>
          <p>I’ve been using RSS readers for decades, but they’ve started feeling more and more like a chore. Something about the inbox/to-do list design, counts of unread items, managing teams and complex filtering rules... I realized they add to my stress level instead of reducing it.
I’ve also come to rely on social media for discovery – hearing about new ideas, tools, papers, people, etc., but I’m so tired of the ads, spam, addictiveness, and toxicity.
Apricot is my attempt to distill the best of both worlds. It’s a web app where users subscribe to feeds like an RSS reader then see new items as they come in, in a single, combined, social media-style feed.
Apricot goes beyond traditional RSS readers in a couple other ways:
  * Users can follow TV shows (via TVmaze), Spotify podcasts, Substack newsletters, YouTube channels, and Subreddits (if/when they come back online) in addition to traditional RSS feeds. I’m open to adding other platforms if there’s demand and the content is programmatically accessible.

  * Cross-platform feed search. I know search isn’t hot at the moment but it’s pretty useful in this context. Search for “Star Trek” and find not just the TV shows, but the podcasts and Subreddits too.

  * Items can be sorted chronologically or with an ML-powered recommender system.

  * Users can filter their feed by platform, which is helpful for specific use cases like finding a good podcast episode for a car ride or a good TV episode to watch after dinner.

  * On-demand, GPT-powered content summaries help users see what an article is really about before clicking. (gotta sprinkle some gen AI on there!)

If you’ve got a few minutes (and come on, with Reddit offline, I know you do), check it out and let me know what you think!

          <p>Last week I had the privilege of attending CSS Day for the second year in a row (and MCing the second day!). I have to say it’s pretty much the most inspiring conference I’ve ever been to. Right off the bat, Una hit the nail on the head when she said that (paraphrasing) if we thought 2022 was a good year for CSS, we ain’t seen nothin’ yet.
Una’s talk was a whistle-stop tour of a huge number of features recently or just about to be released, which was mind-blowing in itself, but what was even more striking was the number of features she didn’t even have time to cover — a whole slide’s worth. It illustrates the blazing pace at which CSS is evolving right now, which as a CSS person, I’m very happy to see.
But I can understand why some people who aren’t quite as deeply immersed in the world of…</p>

          <p>“Just whack a red asterisk next to each field and call it a day.”
Back in 2008 I worked for a software house. We specialised in e-commerce sites for big organisations like Boots, Argos and Homebase.
They had the usual forms.
Registration, forgot password, sign in and checkout. We whacked little red asterisks next to each required field; added some text to the top to explain what it means; and called it a day.
But we never tested it.
We never even really thought about it.
We just followed what everyone else did.
Fast forward 15 years and the same thing happens today. Which is a shame as these little asterisks (and other techniques used to denote required) fields can be a real problem.
Seeing as I get asked about this topic, I thought I’d cover it off so you can focus on more important probl…</p>

          <p>There are two approaches: Broaden your offerings, make them easier, cheaper and more available. Dumb them down and race to the bottom. Or… Focus on the customers who care enough about your idiosyncratic and particular offerings that they’ll not only happily walk away from the lesser alternatives, but they’ll tell the others.</p>

          <a href=https://rewind-ui.dev/ target="_blank">Show HN: Rewind-UI – A ReactJS/TailwindCSS component library</a>
          <p>I recently decided to document and open-source the component library that I&#x27;ve been using internally on all my react-tailwindcss projects and share it.
Rewind-UI uses only TailwindCSS classes, which can be overridden using the className prop on each component or can be fully customized using a theme provider.
It is built on top of the CVA (class-variance-authority - https://cva.style/docs) library, so if anyone needs to adjust the theme, will just need to edit the CVA files.
Furthermore it must be noted that you can add either all the style files in your tailwind.config.js file, or only those that you are going to use, so that you can avoid having a bloated css file.
You can check out the repository here: https://github.com/rewindui/rewindui
Even though it is still in beta I would love to hear your feedback on it.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;36256681 target="_blank">Ask HN: Thunderbird for RSS?</a>
          <p>Am I the only one using Thunderbird strictly as an RSS client? I&#x27;ve seen countless RSS clients recommended here over the years but none ever have the features to make me switch, mainly due to lacking extension support (for things like uBlock Origin and Bypass Paywalls) or privacy concerns from not running on a local Linux desktop. (I haven&#x27;t heavily used the e-mail functionality in Thunderbird in over two decades. I haven&#x27;t tried the Chat or any other functionality at all.)
Is there something I&#x27;m missing out on? Is there a client with all the same features and then some that I just haven&#x27;t found yet? I&#x27;ve looked at Feedly, Inoreader, and many others through the years but none have risen to the level of replacement. It&#x27;s not broken so I&#x27;m not looking to fix it but I&#x27;m open to hearing how others manage their feeds to see if there&#x27;s any possible improvements I&#x27;ve overlooked.
Full disclosure: I&#x27;ve donated in the past to Thunderbird/Mozilla, including company matches.

          <a href=https://rewind-ui.dev/ target="_blank">Show HN: Rewind-UI – A ReactJS/TailwindCSS component library</a>
          <p>I recently decided to document and open-source the component library that I&#x27;ve been using internally on all my react-tailwindcss projects and share it.
Rewind-UI uses only TailwindCSS classes, which can be overridden using the className prop on each component or can be fully customized using a theme provider.
It is built on top of the CVA (class-variance-authority - https://cva.style/docs) library, so if anyone needs to adjust the theme, will just need to edit the CVA files.
Furthermore it must be noted that you can add either all the style files in your tailwind.config.js file, or only those that you are going to use, so that you can avoid having a bloated css file.
You can check out the repository here: https://github.com/rewindui/rewindui
Even though it is still in beta I would love to hear your feedback on it.

          <p>To prevent certain types of side-channel cross-site tracking,
Chrome is partitioning storage and communications APIs in third-party contexts.
Sites that haven&#x27;t had time to adapt their sites for third-party storage
partitioning can take part in a deprecation trial to temporarily unpartition and
restore prior behavior of storage, service workers, and communication APIs in
content embedded on their site.
The deprecation trial is available starting in Chrome 115. It was initially
scheduled to expire in Chrome version 123, ending on May 2, 2024.
Based on feedback, to give developers more time to adapt to the new
implementation of storage partitioning, the storage partitioning deprecation
trial has been extended and will be available until the release of Chrome 127,
scheduled for September 3, 2024.
Learn more about how to participate in deprecation trial for unpartitioned third-party storage, Service Workers, and Communication APIs.</p>

          <p>Lately I&#x27;ve been building an open source component library that I will be using on my projects at work and I&#x27;d love to get your thoughts and experiences on the react UI libraries you use, the challenges you face, and what you think could make them even better.
1. Which React UI libraries do you use?
2. What are your biggest struggles with the UI libraries you use? Every library has its pros and cons. I&#x27;d love to know the pain points you encounter while working with your chosen UI library. Are there any specific challenges or limitations you&#x27;ve come across that hinder your development process?
3. What features do you feel are missing from your favorite UI libraries? Are there any particular features or functionalities that you wish your favorite library offered?
4. What do you enjoy most about your preferred UI library? What do you enjoy most about the library you use?
5. What are the most important features you look for when choosing a React UI library? When evaluating different UI libraries, what factors do you prioritize? Is it performance, ease of use, documentation, community support, or something else entirely?
Thank you in advance!

          <p>Hi,
I really like HN and the simplicity of everything (from create/login workflow to submit links). Everything is fast, straight to the point, and clean/simple HTML.
I&#x27;ve just a really minor complaint: on wide screen, reading comments is really painful (for me at least, I maximise all my windows...). It&#x27;s not the size of the font, it&#x27;s really the width of lines on wide screen. I&#x27;ve the impression that we&#x27;re a lot of developers on HN, with huge screens, and the wide screens experience could be better in &quot;vanilla&quot; HN.
I sometimes open a link in HackerWeb (for instance https://hackerweb.app/#/item/36238342) just to have a better reading experience...
Every thing else: don&#x27;t change, it&#x27;s perfect!

          <p>The race to the bottom has been won. Anything cheaper than what’s on offer is a waste of the customer’s money, because it won’t get the job done. Once we’ve cut every corner, all that’s left is the brutality of less. One slogan is: You’ll pay less than you should have, and waste it all. […]</p>

What are resources that designers are using to get feedback on their WIP stuff?

Keep a collection of useful commands you might need in the future.
I keep such a file in the root directory of my projects.
e.g.: commands.txt
You can even save these commands in a GitHub Gist.
PS: Don’t save sensitive data like passwords and API keys.

          <p>Most things that consumers acquire are bought, not sold. We decide we’re interested in something and we go shopping to get it. Potato chips, wedding venues and cars are all purchased by people who set out to get them. Selling is a special sort of marketing. It’s interactive, generous and personal.

          <p>Federated Credential Management API (FedCM) is a
web API for privacy-preserving identity federation. With identity federation, an
RP (relying party) relies on an IdP (identity provider) to provide the user an
account without requiring a new username and password.
FedCM allows the browser to understand the context in which the RP and IdP
exchange information. It informs the user about the information and privilege
levels being shared and prevents unintended abuse. FedCM has been available in
Chrome since version 108.
In Chrome 115, FedCM is getting support for auto-reauthentication which improves
the user experiences and enables a more streamlined reauthentication to the RP
after the initial consent.

          <p>Hello, Co-Founder of Fab Ahead here.
We are trying a new angle to fight planned obsolescence and other anti-consumer practices by building an open design marketplace that solves the barrier to entry problems of other attempts.
We are doing this by:
• Focusing the platform on physical products that could be substituted for manufactured goods.
• Integrating parts not eligible for additive manufacturing or similar methods into the ecosystem.
• Lowering the skill floor to participate by allowing customers the option to order all form molded parts rather than requiring them to 3D print themselves.
• By lowering the skill floor to allow access to a wider market we can allow product designers to earn a substantial income off royalty style revenue.
The link   is a functional mockup in Shopify of how a customer would interact with the platform.

          <p># Introduction
(This article is also available in form of a video.)
  
  

In 2021, Adobe, together with Chrome engineering, brought a version of Photoshop to the web. The software makes innovative use of WebAssembly with features like SIMD, high performance storage in the origin private file system, the P3 color space for canvas, and Web Components with Lit. In this article, we want to focus on how Adobe Photoshop engineering solved working with files larger than can fit into memory. And, in the case of WebAssembly, how Photoshop works with files larger than the 32-bit address space of wasm32.

Opening a file for editing requires a large amount of memory, significantly more than opening a file for viewing. The files edited in Photoshop often require more memory than a user ha…</p>

          <p>Yesterday&#x27;s article (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;36170105) on flying metallic orbs caught my eye, so I decided to ask ChatGPT how this could be designed. It came up with a design that seems plausible to me (a non-expert), essentially using gyroscopes to induce controllable spin, and uses the Magnus effect to allow the orb to bend through the air like a soccer ball. Wanted to get Hacker New&#x27;s take on whether this design is possible.
Structure and Composition: The orb&#x27;s structure is a sphere composed of strong, lightweight materials akin to those used in modern aircraft or spacecraft. These materials are capable of withstanding the pressures and forces experienced during flight while also minimizing the orb&#x27;s overall weight.
Buoyancy: The orb is filled with a lighter-than-air gas su…</p>

          <p>I struggle with staying productive and organizing myself. I am a chronic procrastinator and have tried everything to be more productive like lists, calendars, apps, etc. but I still can&#x27;t seem to get things done. I want to study more, read more, and finish my coding projects. However, I end up not doing much and feel terribly guilty. I suspect I may have ADHD or some kind of dopamine addiction but I&#x27;m not sure. I do well in school even by studying at the last minute, and I attend a rather challenging school. In my free time though, I end up doing very little or nothing, not knowing where my time went. I try to remove all distractions but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work.
Does anyone have any advice or strategies on how I can improve my productivity and focus? How have you overcome similar challenges to achieve your goals and stay focused? I feel stuck in this cycle of procrastination and distraction and want to break free.

          <p>In 2009 I was working on the Argos checkout flow.
We were considering focusing the first input when the page loads. The idea was to save users a click (never a good sign). Back then we had to use JS, but now we have the HTML5 autofocus attribute.
Either way, automatically focusing the first input causes 5 specific problems that degrade UX.
Here they are:
Problem #1: it makes the page jump unexpectedly
When any normal web page loads, focus remains at the top.
With autofocus, focus jumps suddenly to the first input.
But this is disorientating and may cause users to think something has gone wrong.

				
			Automatically focusing the input makes the page jump
	

Problem #2: it stops users scrolling with the keyboard
Users often scroll a web page after page load by pressing ↑ and ↓.
With autofocus, the keys are ignored because the input is focused.
This makes the interface feel broken.

				
			The up and down keys get ignored as focus is inside the input
	

Problem #3: it stops users going back with the keyboard
Some users navigate back by keyboard using #+← for example.
With autofocus, the shortcut is ignored because the input is focused.
This slows users down.

				
			The keyboard shortcut to go back is ignored as focus is inside the input
	

Problem #4: it’s unexpected for screen reader users
When a web page loads, a screen reader announces the page title.
With autofocus, the input’s label is announced instead.
This is disorientating and causes users to lose context.

				
			The screen reader announces the input instead of the page
	

Problem #5: it works badly on mobile
On mobile, focusing an input usually opens the keyboard.
With autofocus this doesn’t happen. On Android, for example, the input is focused but the user has to tap again to open the keyboard.
This makes the interface feel broken.

				
			On Android, the input is focused but the user needs to tap 
	

Just let users focus the first input
Good design puts users in control.</p>

          <p>Just saw a few creators building better UI versions of HN.
I realize now, that one of the important factors that keep HN&#x27;s audience selective is its simple UI.
IMO if we put the design and UI/UX elements of modern social platforms, it may start to attract a wider audience which certainly is not the intent of this platform.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;36179175 target="_blank">Intentional dark pattern by Coinbase or just terrible UI?</a>
          <p>I recently needed to check a past transfer to confirm that I was sending some crypto to the same wallet address. In the past, the last few transactions showed up on the &quot;Pay&quot; page. They have since renamed &quot;Pay&quot; to Transfers or something like that. They no longer show past transactions, so I went down a rabbit hole of searching through the app, couldn&#x27;t find it, then had to google it and found a help page for Coinbase. There is a link in the article to coinbase.com/reports (I can find no way to get to it from the web app except by following the link from the help article.) Once there, you can select the date ranges you want and generate a transaction report in PDF or CSV and then you have to wait a bit while it generates the report for you to download.
What kind of UI craziness is this? A user&#x27;s transaction history is such a basic feature, I can&#x27;t imagine contributing the obfuscation of this history to just incompetence. There must be some dark pattern here. Perhaps the want to hide from user&#x27;s how much real money they are putting into the system? It seems like a serious security risk anyway. Someone with unauthorized access to an account could easily siphon off crypto and it would be difficult to notice unless you are frequently generating and downloading transaction reports and going through them.
I am not finding much talk of this. Am I in the minority thinking that this is a mission critical, absolutely bare bones feature that should be front and center of any finance related app?

- only encodes necessary characters
- changes attribute quotes to single quotes
- lowercases percent-encoding hex pairs
- swaps hex colors to their shorter named equivalents
- adds xlmns attribute if missing
- removes useless whitespace
If anyone spots any missing optimizations. do let me know.

          <p>Creating screen recordings is an essential skill for web developers. Screen recordings can illustrate new features, bugs, or a variety of other ideas. I’m often asked what app I use to create screen recordings and people are shocked when I tell them Quicktime! Let’s review how to create a screen recording with with Mac’s native […]

          <p>So I was bored and made a retro late 90s style portal website in HTML 3.2. Works with old browsers starting from Netscape Navigator 1.1 (but also has TLS and a tiny bit of CSS for modern browsers).
Basically I tried to answer the question &quot;What now?&quot; after you get your late 90s retrocomputer up and running. Where&#x27;s the fun in games anyway?

          <p># Introduction
(This article is also available in form of a video.)
  
  

Boxy SVG is a vector graphics editor. Its main use case is editing drawings in the SVG file format, for creating illustrations, logos, icons, and other elements of graphic design. It&#x27;s developed by Polish developer Jarosław Foksa and was initially released on March 15, 2013. Jarosław runs a Boxy SVG blog in which he announces new features he adds to the app. The developer is a strong supporter of Chromium&#x27;s Project Fugu and even has a Fugu tag on the app&#x27;s ideas tracker.
# Local Font Access API in Boxy SVG
One feature addition Jarosław blogged about was the Local Font Access API. The Local Font Access API lets users access their locally installed fonts, including higher-level details such as names, styles, and famil…</p>

          <p>The Soviet Union had an engineering problem. Thousands of miles of remote frozen arctic coastline that needed lighthouses and radio towers which required power. But those places were too cold and too remote for human operators in the winter months, so the Soviets devised a plan to deploy small Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs). Radioactive strontium-90 heats an arrangement of metal fins, the fins cool, and a semiconductor turns that energy into electricity. The RTG’s design was the same tech the Soviet Union used to deploy radio to areas without power. What could go wrong?
It’s worth noting this was the advent of the nuclear era; the pre-Chernobyl era. There had been no nuclear disaster that might have made them question this strategy, the superpowers had mastered the atom afte…</p>

          <p># Optimizing JavaScript
Chromium contributors sped up WebGPU performance for GPUComputePassEncoder, GPURenderPassEncoder, and GPUCommandEncoder methods by reducing the overhead of making calls from generated code in V8 JavaScript engine to C++ handlers in Blink rendering engine. See issue chromium:1417558.
The following microbenchmark shows CPU time of calls from JavaScript decreasing from around 0.5 ms per 10K draws to around 0.3 ms per 10K draws, which is a 40% improvement.

# getCurrentTexture() on unconfigured canvas throws InvalidStateError
Calling GPUCanvasContext getCurrentTexture() method on an unconfigured canvas now throws InvalidStateError instead of OperationError according to the WebGPU spec. See issue chromium:1424461.
const context &#x3D; document.querySelector(&quot;canvas&quot;).getContext(&quot;webgpu&quot;);
context.getCurrentTexture(); // Throws InvalidStateError
# WGSL updates
Zero-filled vectors of AbstractInt can now be written as vec2(), vec3(), and vec4(). See issue tint:1892. For example:
vec2() is vec2(0,0)
vec3() is vec3(0,0,0)
vec4() is vec4(0,0,0,0)
# Dawn updates
# Improving error messages
Descriptor labels for invalid objects are not being dropped anymore so that you can see them in error messages. See issue dawn:1771.
# Add missing APIs for Node.js
The GPUAdapter::requestAdapterInfo() and GPUBuffer::getMapState() methods are now implemented for Node.js. See issue dawn:1761.</p>

          <p>Chromium has officially deprecated mutation events, and has a plan to remove support starting with version 127, which goes to stable release on July 30, 2024. This post explains why we are removing mutation events, and provides a path for migrating before they are removed from the browser.
# What are mutation events?
Mutation events is the name for the following collection of events:
DOMNodeInserted
DOMNodeRemoved
DOMSubtreeModified
DOMCharacterDataModified
DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument
DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument
(Not supported by any modern browser) DOMAttrModified
(Not supported by any modern browser) DOMAttributeNameChanged
(Not supported by any modern browser) DOMElementNameChanged
These events are a very old part of the DOM level 2 spec, and they have been deprecated since 2011. They we…</p>

          <p>We expect to remove support for data: URLs in SVG  element
in Chrome 119, scheduled to ship in November 2023.
The SVG spec was recently updated to remove support for data: URLs in SVG  element.
This improves security of the Web platform as well as compatibility between browsers as Webkit does not support data: URLs in SVG  element.
# Reason for the removal
SVG  element can fetch external SVG images and clone it into the current document. This is a powerful capability, and therefore it is restricted to same-origin SVG images.
However, data: URLs are treated as same-origin resources which caused several security bugs, such as bypasses of Trusted Types and Sanitizer API.
These security bugs led to a discussion of the best approach to resolve them. And we came to a consensu…</p>

          <p>I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot recently about how technology, particularly AI, can play a role in personal productivity. One concept that&#x27;s caught my attention is the idea of an &#x27;AI conversation companion&#x27; for tracking thoughts, ideas, and progress in various areas of life. Imagine having an AI that you can converse with on a regular basis, where it asks you thoughtful questions about topics you&#x27;re interested in or working on. Over time, it adapts its questions based on your responses and generates summaries, which can be reviewed and reflected upon at any time.
Such an AI companion could act as a kind of automated journal or diary, providing a space for reflection and self-improvement, but with the added benefits of interactivity and adaptability. It could also serve as an accountability tool, reminding you of your goals and progress, and prompting regular reflection.
What do you all think about the potential of using AI to aid productivity? Have you used any similar tools or services? What methods do you use today to prep helping future AI companions understand your life/goals?

          <p>Motion design is like a magic wand that brings static objects to life. It’s a fascinating form of animation that combines graphic design elements to create visually captivating and dynamic content. You can find it all around you, from websites to mobile applications and even in videos.
What’s so amazing about motion design is its ability to tell stories and engage the audience. By adding animation, storytelling techniques, and captivating visual components, it creates immersive experiences that captivates people’s attention. It’s like a secret ingredient that injects excitement, meaning, and emotion into your content.

          <p>Slightly branching out from the usual western handhelds, I&#x27;ve seen WonderSwans but never played around. Then managed to pick up a faulty &quot;Color&quot; model for £40 on eBay listed as not working.
On inspection it looked, internally, very clean - no corrosion or damage. From my experience with Pokémon Mini handhelds, I was wondering if perhaps the power button wasn&#x27;t getting the signal.
So I applied a slice of kitchen tin foil, some sticky tape and voilà, it powers up! I had to also apply it to the sound and start button (and I&#x27;ll probably make this permanent with conductive paint one day), but otherwise it&#x27;s all good.

# Elements improvements
# New CSS subgrid badge
The Elements panel gets a new subgrid badge for subgrid. This feature is currently experimental in Chrome Canary.
To inspect and debug a nested grid that is a subgrid, and therefore inheriting the number and size of tracks from its parent, click the badge. It toggles an overlay that shows columns, rows, and their numbers on top of the element in the viewport.
For the list of all badges in the Elements panel, see the Badges reference.

CSS [text-wrap: balance] (#text-wrap-balance) is available to improve text layouts.
Cookies partitioned by top level site (CHIPS)are here.
Popovers are easier than even with the Popover API.
And there’s plenty more.
I’m Adriana Jara. Let’s dive in and see what’s new for developers in Chrome 114.

Use text-wrap-balance to improve text layouts. The animation below shows the difference you can make with this one line.

As a developer, you don’t know the final size, font size, or even language of text. All variables are needed for an effective treatment of text wrapping. Since the browser does know all the factors, with text-wrap:balance you can request the browser to figure out the best balanced line…</p>

Construct 3 is a game editor developed by the brothers Thomas and Ashley Gullen. For the present third iteration of their game editor, the two fully &quot;[bet] on the browser being the new operating system&quot; after building for Windows and NW.js before. You can get an impression of some games developed with the editor by exploring its showcase or working through the guided tour.

          <p>A year ago, in May 2022, we added the side panel to Chrome. This is a new companion surface that allows users to use tools alongside the content they are browsing. Today, we&#x27;re excited to announce that your extension can start showing content in the side panel, beginning in Chrome 114.

# Better for users, easier for developers
We&#x27;ve already seen many developers implement sidebar-like experiences into their extension, which is
why we&#x27;re thrilled to make it a platform standard. With the new Side Panel API, you
can now offer a persistent UI that opens alongside a page that the user is visiting. Users will
benefit from consistent positioning and layout between extensions. In addition, the ability to show
UI without requesting host permissio…</p>

          <p>Warning
As we&#x27;ve announced in January 2022, we are deprecating the document.domain setter in Chrome 115. If your website relies on relaxing the
same-origin policy via document.domain, your immediate
action is required.
Continue to read more about why this is changing or skip to alternative code you can implement.
# What&#x27;s changing, and why?
Starting in Chrome 115, websites will be unable to set document.domain: Chrome will make document.domain immutable. To communicate cross-origin, you need to use alternative approaches, such as postMessage() or the Channel
Messaging API.
Note that this change will be rolled out progressively.
We expect other browsers to eventually deprecate and remove this functionality. Review the browser compatibility section for details.

          <p>Over the last year, Intel has been collaborating with Google and other parties
on the Compute Pressure API. In Chrome 115, you can register for an origin
trial to help test this new API, and this post explains the problems the API has
been designed to solve, and shows how to use it.
The Compute Pressure API was in origin trial from Chrome 92 to
Chrome 94. Since this first origin trial, many changes have been made to
the API. The existing article on the
Compute Pressure API is updated with more details.

          <p>As part of our efforts to improve privacy on the web, the Chrome team has been actively working to prevent cross-site tracking of users. We plan to launch mitigations to limit tracking from a particular technique called &quot;bounce tracking&quot; later this year.
While we don&#x27;t expect many non-tracking sites will be adversely affected by these changes, we would like to invite developers to test this new feature with feature flags and provide feedback.
# What is bounce tracking?
Bounce tracking is a technique that allows a third-party site to store a cookie even when third-party cookies are blocked. Third-party tracking code included on a page can be used to redirect a user to a tracker&#x27;s site, where a cookie can be set, then back to the original page. This redirection can often happen so quickly th…</p>

          <p>Hi HN,
I am assuming that most Software Engineers don’t get hands on System Design work in their day-to-day job, my questions are:
1. How to prep for System Design Interviews, given that most resources out there are very superficial in their explanation of what technology to use, when to use it and why to use it?
2. Will becoming good at prepping for System Design interviews actually help in designing large scale systems better?
3. If not 2, then how do you become better at designing actual systems?
I already know that DDIA is a good resource but it does not help you design concrete systems.
