          <p>I&#x27;m curious what your favorite solutions are for working with code, ideally with built in automatic code indentation and not too heavy on CPU usage.
This has been a pain for me as a Sublime Text user. I noticed it has quirks that make indentation a problem and without ease of readability my productivity suffers tremendously since  my work involves dealings with long nested functions.

          <p>Olivia Hoskin
      Writer &amp; Design Enthusiast 

Remember when Tidying Up with Marie Kondo was released on Netflix in January 2019, just in time for us to stay home for the most time we’ve ever spent at our primary residences? The Japanese organizing consultant that helps families organize their homes and embrace “minimalism” was definitely on to something.
When considering mobile app design, sometimes more is not always better. In fact, in most cases, more is not always better. The mobile apps below beautifully showcase minimalist design, helping users focus on the app’s content and intended purpose instead of the design itself.
We hope you enjoy these minimalist apps as much as we enjoyed curating them! ■

          <p># Container queries are here!
Exciting news—one of the most highly requested developer features has begun to land in web browsers! As of Chromium 105 and Safari 16, you can now create size-based container queries and use container query unit values in these browsers. To make it even easier to use size-based container queries and cq units, the Aurora team at Chrome has been hard at work updating the Container Query Polyfill to support more browsers and use cases so you can feel confident using this powerful feature today.
Container queries are a part of the css-contain-3 specification. This specification covers new unit values and both size and style container types, though browsers are initially launching with only the support of size-containment. Because of this, we’ll focus on size conta…</p>

Is this stuff being done by solo unicorns (frontend devs with good color + design instincts?). Or more often by teams of at least a few people.
Is it a quick process that&#x27;s often right the first time, or am I looking at months of design iteration and testing when I see a UX that looks even &#x27;nice&#x27;.

          <p>I&#x27;ve been using Google Photos for a good amount of time, and have had so many bad experiences with the app. It takes so long for syncing, poor UI, and looks cluttered like Google Drive. JUST MAKE IT MORE SIMPLE!

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32837397 target="_blank">Ask HN: Why is Disney+ UX so bad?</a>
          <p>A few weeks ago I bought a one month Disney+ subscription to check it out. I have all kinds of problems when using their web player compared to Netflix and YouTube:
- subtitle settings get reset every time I close the website.
- the button for changing subtitles is in the upper right corner. Once you open the menu the button for closing it appears in the upper left corner. You can&#x27;t close the menu by clicking outside of it, despite the fact that you can still see the blurred video in the background.
- pressing space doesn&#x27;t pause the video, but repeats the last action you did. If you closed the subtitle menu by pressing esc, pressing space will open it again. If you entered the full screen mode, pressing space will close it.
- there is no way (afaik) to open a list of all episodes from within the player. You have to go back to the show&#x27;s main page, choose the season (because it always defaults to season 1) and scroll a horizontal list (which always defaults to the first episode) using a button that appears only once you hover it. Scrolling with a mouse scroll/touchpad doesn&#x27;t work.
- it is impossible to search for movies using a director&#x27;s name. For example, I know that Disney+ has a lot of Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s and Wes Anderson&#x27;s movies available - they are my favorite directors - but I couldn&#x27;t quickly check which specific movies there are.
I know that it&#x27;s possible that I have higher standards of UX because I&#x27;m a programmer, but I doubt that Disney+&#x27;s interface is intuitive to anyone.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32832474 target="_blank">Ask HN: Why is the iOS UI difficult to maneuver?</a>
          <p>I recently purchased an old iPhone 11 Pro Max to try out, after being an Android user the last 12yrs, last phone being the Oneplus 7. I knew there would be big differences and I tried to be as accepting as possible along the way.
It&#x27;s been a few weeks now and I would really like to hear from current or former iPhone users on their thoughts about iOS&#x27;s maneuverability.
My thoughts:
The iOS UI thrives on having the user perform tedious steps to perform very simple actions [1], is difficult to use in one hand (I understand there are smaller models but I wanted a bigger battery, this should not excuse the lack of maneuverability), and THERE IS NO UNIVERSAL BACK BUTTON! When you need to go back, you have to figure out how the current app wants you to go backwards. Swipe from the left edge? anywhere on screen? or exit using the button at the top of the screen? It&#x27;s a guessing game every time.
I really want to like this phone, the hardware is incredible and the software support for years is terrific. Could long time users please chime in on how they got used to it?
[1] Reaching to the top right corner to drag down the Control Panel. Having to press the &#x27;Select&#x27; button in Photos instead of long pressing a photo. Having to tap a toggle icon exactly for it to change status.

          <p>You might already be aware of how we can use feature detection in CSS to check whether a particular property and value combination is supported. This is a pretty smart way to go about writing robust CSS that caters for users with a whole range of browsers and devices with different capabilities, and is infinitely preferable to user agent sniffing. We can check whether a browser supports aspect-ratio, say, and provide a fallback in cases where lack of support would hamper the user experience.
.some-element {
  max-height: 200px;
}
@supports (aspect-ratio: 1) {
  .some-element {
    aspect-ratio: 1;
    max-height: none;
  }
}
This particular block of code sets a max-height on an element, except when aspect-ratio is supported, when we’ll use that instead.
We could make this a bit more concis…</p>

          <p>The goal of the Open UI initiative is to make it easier for developers to make great user experiences. To do this, we are trying to tackle the more problematic patterns that developers face. We can do this by providing better platform built-in APIs and components.
One such problem area is pop-ups.
Pop-ups have had a rather polarizing reputation for a long time. This is, in part, due to the way they get both built and deployed. They&#x27;re not an easy pattern to build well, but they can yield a lot of value by directing users to certain things, or making them aware of the content on your site—especially when used in a tasteful manner.
There are often two major concerns when building pop-ups:
How to make sure it gets placed above the rest of your content in an appropriate place.

Kevin Tome

Tell us about your background. Do you have any previous design experience?
Hi, I’m Kevin, based in Ontario, Canada. I’ve been in design for 8 years, and I’ve mostly specialized in marketing and brand design. I really enjoy UI/UX and wanted to pivot my career. I find product design a refreshing change of pace.
Why did you choose Dribbble’s Certified Product Design Course?
Dribbble’s Product Design Course seemed very accessible and I’m a big fan of Jesse Showalter. My good friend took a UI/UX Dribbble Course, and really e…</p>

          <p>Disclaimer: Thought Experiment. Does not need to be &quot;practical&quot;. Let your NIH flow and your imagination run wild
We&#x27;ve learned a lot about computers in the decades we&#x27;ve been producing. A lot of software assumes that computers work a certain way. See Go lang and how it handles file permissions. In the Linux Kernel drivers exist that supports the IBM 3270 Display System which at this point is over 50 years old. Terminal Emulators mimic the VT100. All of this makes sense given the context in which they were developed and created. But if you were developing an OS in 2022 without these constraints what would you remove and or change? Would you keep 32bit support? Arm, Risc and or x86?, monolithic or microkernel?, C, Rust, Zig, D, C++, or something else?, how would it talk to hardware?, what would your executable format look like?
Also if anyone has any interesting links to cutting edge research into Modern Operating Systems I&#x27;d love to browse them!

While technical in nature, the course content was aimed not only at developers, but at web practitioners of all kinds who were interested in improving their understanding of web performance concepts and how they relate to creating faster, and more resilient experiences for their users.
That positioning acknowledged a change that was happening in the web performance world at the time and that indeed continues today. Technical web performance concepts are becoming increasingly relevant to a wide varie…</p>

          <p>August brought about some pretty sweeping changes. Kids are going back to school and I’ve found myself stepping back from some commitments.
Running out of spoons
This month I ran out of spoons. Neck-deep into starting a company and feeling that ambient stress, I realized I’m running out of available bandwidth. This manifests in tiredness, grumpiness, back pain, etc. I made the tough decision to step back from some extracurricular activities: a podcast, Open UI, my DnD group, and a handful of other obligations.
A lot of it comes down to something I mentioned in my post about PARA, the idea that projects have an end date. Almost everything I do ends up being an open-ended project. I need to reset a bit to hedge against that tendency.
Twitter overhaul
In the interest of protecting the spoons …</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32780191 target="_blank">Ask HN: What happened to vanilla HTML/CSS/JS development?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;m not a web developer, but I dabble in it because I find it interesting. I went through some courses like The Odin Project and others to learn the basics of HTML/CSS/JS, and I thought it made a lot of sense: HTML structures the page, CSS handles the style, and JS handles the functionality.
However, after working for software companies for a few years, it seems like almost nobody uses these technologies in the way they&#x27;re presented on websites like w3schools to make web applications. Instead, they use component-based frameworks like React. To me, these frameworks seem way more complicated than HTML/CSS/JS, and I don&#x27;t understand what problem they&#x27;re trying to solve. What makes the trade-off of all that extra complexity and abstraction worth it? Aren&#x27;t HTML/CSS/JS perfectly fine and time-tested tools for web development on their own?

These are a few relevant blog posts if you are new to C/C++ debugging and the Memory Inspector:

# Introduction
The Memory Inspector provides you with more powerful debugging options for linear memory buffers. In the case of C/C++, you can inspect C/C++ memory objects in the WebAssembly Memory.

          <p>Hey HN,
I made this free browser extension that modernizes the Hacker News design.
I previously launched Modern for Wikipedia [1] here back in December, and it seemed like the obvious next choice to build one for HN too!  So I&#x27;ve taken what I learned from building that, and have spent all my spare time this year building Modern for HN.
I realize this won&#x27;t be for everyone, but it was a fun project to work on, and I&#x27;m really happy with the result so far. Hope you like it too!
Lots more planned for future updates, and suggestions welcome :)

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32753619 target="_blank">Ask HN: What were your first steps in system architecture/design?</a>
          <p>I have only had around 2 YoE as a backend developer, but I already have a deep interest in system design.
That said, I have realistic expectations in that becoming a software architect requires field experience with different systems, patterns, making mistakes and learning some lessons the hard way.
Nonetheless, I already started learning at least the theoretical foundations thanks to:
* Designing Data-Intensive Applications
* System Design Primer
* Web Scalability for Startup Engineers
* System Design Interview by Alex Xu
* Quastor subscription
* Infoq talks, etc.
My interest is only increasing, and I try to participate as much as possible in architecture-related discussions at work with the more experienced developers.
Thanks to the learning resources, it&#x27;s no longer a problem to understand the theory, but due to lack of experience, I understandably feel anxious and unconfident thinking about designing something myself.
Let me make it clear, I understand that with that little experience under the belt, you can&#x27;t suddenly become a software architect after having read a book.
However, some day everyone should start. It would be really cool to find out how currently experienced software architects started their path, designed their first systems, what they would recommend to optimize and fasten the learning process.
Thanks!

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32756660 target="_blank">Netlify or CloudFlare just replaced our production CSS file with “hello”</a>
          <p>We have a few hundred sites serving their nav 
menus using a shared CSS file located in a private Github repo. This file is hosted via Netlify with CloudFlare in front.
This afternoon we started receiving a number of reports of broken nav styling on the US west coast. On loading these sites, the minified CSS file was replaced with the word &quot;hello&quot;.
No commits have been made to this repo since May.  I checked the commit history of the minified file and &quot;hello&quot; was never written by accident at any point. Clearing out the CF cache addressed this.
Thoughts?

We’ve also continued to iterate on a few other projects to help folks get up and running with Bootstrap with npm, other JS frameworks, and various build tools. Keep reading to learn more.
Key changes
We’ve updated our calc() functions to work around an apparent bug in postcss-values-parser that prevented our source Sass files from compiling properly when building with React and PostCSS. The fix was to reverse the order of our multiplication inside calc() functions. Be aware you may need to make similar modifications depending on your own customizations.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32741902 target="_blank">Ask HN: Why do companies want us “back in office” despite productivity costs?</a>
          <p>I might be too &#x27;junior&#x27; to grok what goes behind the curtains. When I did a quick survey amongst my software friends, all of their workplaces have been pushing for bringing people back in offices. Some are a bit soft and coy about it (&quot;From November, we will allow you to choose WFH for half the week!&quot;), And some are straightforward &quot;you have to&quot;.
In my workplace, the management itself reported high remote productivity. Despite this, we will be asked to work remotely only half the time. They even have a big new building in city center location.
Is it simply something cynical, e.g. Trying to hold on to prime real estate, or somplyyabout control? Or is there indeed legitimate net benefit to working in offices?

          <p>We currently have a web app hosted on the cloud. The HTTP server does server-side rendering, including serving up static CSS and SVG files.
For reasons, the web server framework doesn&#x27;t support 
caching out-of-the-box and we hand-roll our own.
I thought we might as well complexify our deployment step instead and reap some performance benefits. Immediately, I thought to use Amazon S3 for the CSS files. Does any one else do this? Is there something lower latency than S3?

          <p>Hi HN,
Long story short - I&#x27;m looking around to see if there are any job boards that would be focused on finding UX people.
My friend has a degree in architecture, she was working for quite a few years in variety of building design shops. At some point in her life she moved to suburbs and had children, took a few years off to care for them. Now kids are in school and she is looking to go back to work life, she is craving for interaction with people. She decided to pivot her career and do UX since it is something she is familiar with from her previous jobs, the reason for doing this is that where she lives it would take her roughly 2 hours driving to get to the city and her previous industry is not very remote-friendly.
She is trying to get hired as junior UX, however with no success. It had been a couple of months now and she is reaching the point of being depressed for being rejected from every place shy is applying to. I have no experience with UX to give her advice on making her first steps.
I know it&#x27;s probably not the best time for juniors but life likes to write scenarios with no regard to economic situation... so any advice would be highly appreciated :)

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32687949 target="_blank">Ask HN: What do you use as the “internal admin UI”?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;ve been building products for many years and, most of the time, my &quot;admin UI&quot; would be some SQL GUI (currently Adminer with a custom plugin).
That&#x27;s what I&#x27;d use to resolve support cases, change some data for the customers when it&#x27;s absent from the real UI, etc.
Usually, there&#x27;s just no time to build internal admin apps when you&#x27;re a solo founder or a small team.
However, I&#x27;m not really happy with this way of doing things. There&#x27;s no &quot;global search&quot;, no place to attach notes, and often it&#x27;s hard to jump to related records (e.g. client -&gt; client&#x27;s transactions) quickly.
As I&#x27;d run the SQL GUI locally, it&#x27;s always hard to share links to some records with my team, other than in the form of screenshots.
The list of problems goes on and on.
-----
Hence it prompted this question. What do you use? How do you debug data issues? How do you help customers? How do you share links (whatever form they take) to data with your team and collaborate?

          <p>HtDP teaches mainly functional programming. But the real world still uses imperative programming majorly.
Those who used HtDP as a first resource to get into programming what did they use to learn imperative programming and then other subjects of CS like data structures and algorithms?
Or is it better to use HtDP after you have already programmed using bad style in an imperative language?

          <p>I wanted to ask if it&#x27;s okay to upload your graphic design work/test/assignments that you have done for a job interview. 
(Even if you haven&#x27;t been selected for the role but produced good work) 
Please share your experiences.

          <p>To improve privacy, Chrome is changing how storage and communication APIs will
behave in future releases. Read more about the upcoming change in
Storage Partitioning.
The initial implementation has been available behind a flag in Chrome 105,
since July 2022. Starting in Chrome Beta 106, from September 2022, the new
implementation (which includes Cache Storage partitioning) is available for
testing. The latest features and bug fixes will land in Chrome Canary first, so
consider using Canary for continued testing.
This change should not affect the most common use cases where your app only
uses storage in a first-party context, but we recommend testing to ensure that
your applications will continue to work as they do today. If you interact with,
or rely on storage in iframes, there&#x27;s a higher…</p>

          <p>Federated Credential Management API (FedCM)
is a web API for privacy-preserving identity federation. With identity
federation, an RP (relying party) relies on an IdP (identity provider) to
provide the user an account without requiring a new username and password.
FedCM is a purpose-built API that allows the browser to understand the context
in which the RP and IdP exchange information, inform the user as to the
information and privilege levels being shared and prevent unintended abuse.
FedCM origin trial began in Chrome 101 on Android and Chrome 103 on desktop. It
was initially scheduled to end in version 105. Based on feedback, the API has
undergone changes, so to give developers more time to test the new
implementation and syntax, the origin trial has been extended.
FedCM origin trial will now be available until the release of Chrome 108,
scheduled for November 23, 2022.
Read more about the changes and sign up to participate in the FedCM origin trial.</p>

          <p>Chrome DevTools makes debugging CSS flexbox layouts intuitive. The Elements panel provides you with a context-aware Flexbox Editor and customizable overlay.


Watch the video to learn how to:
Use the Flexbox Editor to change flexbox properties with a click of a button instead of typing them.
Toggle the flexbox overlay in the viewport to see the changes you make right away.
Use the Elements &gt; Layout &gt; Flexbox section to see a list of all elements and locate them in the DOM tree. Additionally, you can customize the overlay colors here.
To learn more about CSS flexbox in general, see Learn CSS &gt; Flexbox.
For a more hands-on debugging experience in DevTools, follow the Inspect and debug CSS flexbox layouts tutorial.</p>

# Remove non-ASCII characters in cookie domain attributes
To align with the latest spec (RFC 6265bis), Chromium now rejects cookies with a Domain attribute that contains non-ASCII characters (for example, éxample.com).
Support for IDN domain attributes in cookies has been long unspecified, with Chromium, Safari, and Firefox all behaving differently. This change standardizes Firefox&#x27;s behavior of rejecting cookies with non-ASCII domain attributes.
Since Chromium has previously accepted non-ASCII characters and tried to convert them to normalized punycode for storage, we will now apply stricter …</p>

          <p># Why we need COEP
Some web APIs increase the risk of side-channel attacks such as
Spectre. To
mitigate that risk, browsers offer an opt-in-based isolated environment called
cross-origin isolation, which, among other things,
requires deploying COEP. This allows websites to use privileged features
including
SharedArrayBuffer,
performance.measureUserAgentSpecificMemory(),
and
high-precision timers with better resolution.
To enable cross-origin isolation, websites must send the following two HTTP
headers:
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
COEP:credentialless can also be used as an alternative to require-corp.
# Challenges with enabling COEP
While cross-origin isolation brings webpages better security and the ability to
enable powerful features,…</p>

          <p>The service I am building is usage-based, i.e.
  * I am charging per second the service was used, e.g. USD 0.01/second
  * I would like to give credits upon sign-up.
  * There is no monthly minimum.

  * &#x60;billing_account (id, billing_rate_id, running_balance)&#x60;
  * &#x60;billing_rate (id, rate)&#x60;
  * &#x60;account_credit (id, billing_account_id, timestamp, amount, function_execution_id)&#x60;
  * &#x60;account_debit (id, billing_account_id, timestamp, amount, source [platform_credit or stripe])&#x60;

Then whenever they run a function that costs them, I create &#x60;account_credit&#x60; account with an entry equal to the amount they spent and update &#x60;billing_account&#x60; &#x60;running_balance&#x60; value.
When they top-up their account, I would just add entry to &#x60;account_debit&#x60; and update the balance again.
This appears to cover all my use cases, but I wanted to check with anyone who&#x27;s designed such database schemas before.

          <p>I want to design/build/manufacture a very stripped down version of Dakboard [1]. Using Photo Frame like the ones available in Amazon for a display[2]. It needs to pull calendar data or images from an API and render it so that customers always sees a latest monthly calendar.
I once thought of contacting one of those manufacturer of the Photo Frames and ask them if they can do the necessary tweaks. But I&#x27;m not sure what details to give them.
What is the prep work necessary for this? I&#x27;ve absolutely no idea where to start but it&#x27;s one of the project ideas that I come back to again and again and want to get it done no matter what.
Where do I even start at this? Any pointers would help tremendously.
Thanks HN.

          <p>Hi there. I spent the last couple months building this chrome extension to scratch my own itch. It allows you to extract a snippet of HTML along with its styles and export to inline styles or JSX. It’s not perfect and doesn’t work on every site. There is class support but I am still working on it along with some other cool features. Feedback is appreciated.

          <p>Hey,
Let&#x27;s build websites for every one of us: »At the end of 2021, approximately 7.8 million severely disabled people were living in Germany. […] The percentage of severely disabled people in the total population in Germany stood at 9.4%.« – Statistisches Bundesamt
When I first stumbled upon these numbers, I could not believe them. It is one more reason to learn about digital accessibility now. We are all individuals with different strengths, weaknesses, backgrounds, needs, and possibilities. I think every human being should be able to interact with the websites we are building.

          <p>Hi friends! Way back in June (which already feels like such a long time ago in CSS land!) I had the pleasure of speaking about CSS layout at CSS Day conference. I’m pleased to say the video has now been published! Take a look to learn about a whole bunch of modern CSS layout techniques, with a few little tricks thrown in.
https://www.youtube.com/embed/tueTFd2TQUA
I attempted to pack a lot into this talk, but what I tried to emphasise is that many of the new CSS features we have at our disposal help (and even encourage) us to embrace the flexible web of the present day. One where we can’t possibly predict what kind of devices our user is browsing our website on, but where we can ensure our layouts are robust across all devices, by eschewing pixel-perfection in favour of something more intri…</p>

          <p># Introduction
Today, authors can use many abstractions to build their Web applications. Instead of directly interfacing with the lower-level APIs that the Web Platform provides, many authors leverage frameworks, build tools and compilers to write their applications from a higher-level perspective.
For example, components built on top of the Angular framework are authored in TypeScript with HTML templates. Underneath the hood, the Angular CLI and webpack compile everything to JavaScript and into a so-called bundle, which is then shipped to the browser.
When debugging or profiling Web applications in DevTools, you currently get to see and debug this compiled version of your code instead of the code you actually wrote. As an author, this is not want you want, though:
You don’t want to debug …</p>

          <p># An improved debugging experience
Over the past few months the Chrome DevTools team collaborated with the Angular team to launch improvements to the debugging experience in Chrome DevTools. People from both teams worked together and took steps towards enabling developers to debug and profile web applications from the authoring perspective: in terms of their source language and project structure, with access to information that is familiar and relevant to them.
This post takes a look under the hood to see which changes in Angular and Chrome DevTools were required to achieve this. Even though some of these changes are demonstrated through Angular, they can be applied to other frameworks as well. The Chrome DevTools team encourages other frameworks to adopt the new console APIs and source ma…</p>

happen. 


The Web SQL Database API, which allows you to store data in a
structured manner on the user&#x27;s computer (internally based on the SQLite database engine), was
introduced in April 2009 and
abandoned in November 2010. While it
was implemented in WebKit (which powers Safari and early versions of Chrome) and remained active in
the Blink engine (that powers Chrome after the switch from WebKit), Gecko (which powers Firefox)
never implemented this feature and
WebKit removed it in 2019.
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
encourages
those needing web databases to adopt
Web Storage API technologies like
localStorage and
sessionStorage, or
IndexedDB. These
technologies show their strengths when it comes to ke…</p>

          <p>Slack has, for example, the Bolt frameworks (https://api.slack.com/tools/bolt) where a back-end developer can leverage the Slack UI to build whole apps. It is possible to build quite complex workflows without leaving the back-end language of the framework, using Slack Block Kit (https://api.slack.com/block-kit) like lego pieces of a simple UI.
Is there something else similar, a framework/platform where one (mainly a back-end dev) can build an app using ready UI components?

          <p>I&#x27;m trying to find a app for Ubuntu that has exactly same features as Joplin but different colors,  and different UI. Because ik it&#x27;s stupid to tell, but I&#x27;m getting negative vibes and it&#x27;s not matching my energy when I use joplin but I love the joplin because it does everything that I want.
Important features for me are:
1) Paste image (embed it so that you can see it instantly, wysiwyg)
2) Have multiple tabs support (vertical bar or horizontal bar doesn&#x27;t matter).
3) Increase font by zooming with pinch touchpad movement. Or just have better font size choices.
4) Scrolling with mouse or touchpad should be smooth. (It&#x27;s not smooth in trilium notes).
That&#x27;s all I want, and I&#x27;m quite surprised it&#x27;s so tough to find an app that does both in laptop.

Brittney Singleton
      Visual Designer


Tell us about your background. Do you have any previous design experience?
Hi, I’m Britt, and I’m a multidisciplinary designer specializing in visual, UI/UX, and brand design. I started out as a web and graphic designer back in 2010. My career took off, eventually landing me an Art Director position at a large bank. But then, life happened. I got sick. Extremely sick, leaving me bed bound for a few years after I was diagnosed with Ly…</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/compression-streams-api/ target="_blank">Compression and decompression in the browser with the Compression Streams API</a>
          <p>The Compression Streams API
is for compressing and decompressing streams of data using the gzip or
deflate (or deflate-raw) formats.
With built in compression JavaScript applications do not need to include a compression
library, making the download size of the application smaller. Stable Chrome and Safari Technology Preview now
support this useful API. Compressing data is shown below.
const readableStream &#x3D; await fetch(&#x27;lorem.txt&#x27;).then(
  (response) &#x3D;&gt; response.body
);
const compressedReadableStream &#x3D; readableStream.pipeThrough(
  new CompressionStream(&#x27;gzip&#x27;)
);
To decompress, pipe a compressed stream through the decompression stream.
const decompressedReadableStream &#x3D; compressedReadableStream.pipeThrough(
  new DecompressionStream(&#x27;gzip&#x27;)
);
# Demo
 

# Browser support
The Compression Streams API is supported from Chromium 80 and Safari Technology Preview 152.
For other browsers, check CanIUse.

          <p>Technological leaps always take us by surprise. What happens when every visual image ever created can be remixed and expanded? Van Gogh, Superman, or Moses. These link to an open search engine, so your mileage may vary. New software allows anyone to create images simply by typing in a dozen or so words. And software […]</p>

          <p>Hello HN !
I&#x27;m the founder of https://symfoz.com which is basically a RSS aggregator that allows people to partition the content they want to see in dedicated spaces called &quot;Playlists&quot;, thus reducing the time needed to find the information they need.
Why Symfoz instead of other RSS aggregators ?
- Create playlists of content, avoid mixing too many feeds in the same place. You know where everything is.
- Follow people or playlists, people can create some playlists with AWESOME content, you may benefit from it.
- We handle classic RSS feeds, but also Youtube channels, Twitter feeds, Spotify Podcasts, sub-reddits.
- An easy UI interface (This is still WIP, UI is very hard haha)
- Promote retention of information by allowing people to take notes (not highlighting but really take notes), instead of just consuming content and forget it. You&#x27;ll be able to find your notes easily.
A bit more about the project (you can skip this!), this is a side project that I&#x27;ve been working on for almost a year.
I&#x27;m a back-end developer and the stack runs in Python. If you&#x27;d like more details, please feel free to ask, I&#x27;ll be glad to answer !
Thanks for taking the time to read this, feel free to give any feedback, I would be really grateful :) !

Each site that has a Terms of Service written in impenetrable and indecipherable legalese, like this sentence, delights in that complexity to dissuade users from reading it and realizing just what they are giving up. “Am”, “add”, and “it”…</p>

          <p>There are two marketing problems when it comes to creating interventions for the public good. The first marketing problem is that when it works we take the intervention for granted. The world doesn’t fall apart, and we don’t notice, because our expectation was that the world (whatever world matters to you) should stay on course. […]</p>

          <p>When I first heard Nicole Sullivan talk about OOCSS, I thought “Oooh, smart.” When I read Jonathan Snook’s riff on that idea in SMACSS I thought “Oooh, smart.” When I heard Harry Roberts say “never use IDs in your CSS files” I said “Oooh, smart.”
But when BEM and roboclasses came around… I didn’t have the same reaction. I never felt attracted to these tools even though thousands of developers had success with them. I’m not sure why I never jumped in, but I’m sure verbosity and/or tooling fatigue played a part. Ultimately, I ended up settling on my own SMACSS/BEM hybrid that’s more of a .block--variant .generic {}  pattern with some global utilities mixed in.
I’m not anti-BEM nor anti-roboclasses, but as we enter a new era for CSS I think we have an opportunity to rethink best practices aro…</p>

          <p>In May 2022, the Aurora and Angular teams announced that they would collaborate on an image directive for Angular. The directive was recently released for developer preview as part of Angular v14.2. This post talks about how the new image directive, NgOptimizedImage, supports image optimization in Angular.
# Background
Images are a common and crucial component of web user experience, with 99.9% of web pages generating requests for one or more images. Images are also the most significant contributors to page weight, constituting a median of 982 kilobytes per page.
Due to their growing number and size, images can hinder the performance of web pages and affect Core Web Vitals metrics. For 79.4% of desktop pages, an image was the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) element in 2021. The pursuit of o…</p>

          <p>I really hope that the collective intelligence of Hacker News has answers, because this is the type of question that you cannot ask on stackoverflow.
The question is exactly as the title says. The following text provides context, but if you already understand what I am after, you can skip it.
----------------------------
In 1992, when we saw Visio for the first time, we  hoped that one day we would be able to use it for creating software design documents visually, and then deploying them with the press of a button. Visio is a general-purpose diagram-drawing application, so it cannot do that, but it has always supported linking and embedding, so in theory it could be used for this purpose by a specialized software design tool. However, I have never head of any such tool.

When someone cares enough to make an assertion and show their work, a healthy organization or society takes a look. The alternative is the brittle, closed culture of talking points, loyalty oaths and unquestioned status quo. It might be a neighborhood […]</p>

          <p>In October Chrome will take the next step in reducing the information
available in the browser&#x27;s User-Agent (UA) string, to improve privacy for users. With
this change, websites and services that rely on the User-Agent string for
certain information may need to take action. Here&#x27;s some background on what&#x27;s
happening, why Chrome is making this change, and what you can do to prepare.
# Why is User-Agent string changing
The User-Agent string includes information about the browser and the type
of device a person is using. The UA string has played an instrumental
role for websites that
want to customize user experiences as well as for anti-fraud providers who rely
on this information to identify bots and malicious attacks. Chrome is committed
to maintaining those important use cases.

          <p>The Console Utilities API lets you speed up your debugging workflow by providing a variety of shortcuts.


With the Console Utilities API, you can:
Stop typing long commands like document.querySelector() and, instead, use jQuery-style $ shortcuts to specify elements.
Refer to the last five DOM elements you selected on the Elements panel.
Quickly refer to elements by their XPath, which you can copy in the Element panel.
Query objects by their constructors.
List just the keys or values of objects.
Copy string representations of objects to clipboard.
Get event listeners.
Monitor events and function calls.
For a comprehensive list of all the Console Utilities API shortcuts, see the Console Utilities API reference.</p>

          <p>Hey HN, 10 years after the project began we have updated the UI for the cloud server comparison site known as EC2Instances.info. This refresh brings a sticky filter bar so you can scroll and see what filters are applied, a more compact navbar, and improved UX for comparing instances.
I&#x27;ve also fixed numerous long standing UI bugs including: comparisons now load correctly on RDS and ElastiCache, sort by max ENI works, sort by RDS instance storage works, and all dropdowns have consistent behavior.
For maintainers and contributors, all the frontend libraries are upgraded to their latest versions, https://github.com/vantage-sh/ec2instances.info. Going forward, we are aware that the homepage size is quite large and have plans to address this.
We have tried to be good stewards of this project and evolve it carefully. Eager to hear what you think of the new UI!

But we use lists in all sorts of ways on the web. A collection of upcoming concerts at a venue? Very likely a list. A multi-step booking process? Quite possibly a list. A gallery of images? Even that could be considered a list of images with captions.
In this article we&#x27;ll dive into the different HTML list types available to us on the web and when to use them, including some attributes you might not be familiar with. We&#x27;ll also take a look at some useful and creative ways to style them with CSS.

          <p>Hey there..
I have started writing a book on software design/architecture that provides a different perspective than existing books out there. The thesis of the book is that &quot;code is for humans&quot;. The book explains how to write code that is optimal for our primitive monkey brains. The book describes how many of the best practices in software stem from deficiencies in our cognitive abilities. It expands on best practices such as (DRY, SSOT, etc) and brings new ideas on what is good code and how to write it.
I am looking for someone to partner with on this book as it&#x27;s a huge project and I would love to be able to split the work.
I have written a rough outline and filled in about 40 pages of notes, examples and text. The project is still very much in it&#x27;s infancy.
A bit about me: I worked as the software architect of a 100+ person team at Mobileye/Intel and have many, many years of experience working on a variety of software from self driving cars to web apps.

          <p>I&#x27;m a cs student who have been selling a very specific and niche bicycle part. I have already sell quite a few locally using facebook marketplace. I recently tried Amazon and sold a few but was shocked by the 15% cut.
I&#x27;m wondering if I can/should make an online shop using vanilla html and css with PayPal/Stripe API payment buttons. I only have 3 product models and don&#x27;t need shopping carts as most people would just buy one item. Shipping fee will also be fixed. No need for SEO or analytics. I have made a few websites before and enjoy making simple lightweight ultra-fast websites, so time spent on developing the website wouldn&#x27;t be a cost to me.
Any security / legal / business aspects that I should consider?

          <p>It’s typical to include machines, rent, stationery, all that stuff. But the real startup costs are the missteps, errors and learnings that every new project goes through on the way to success. They’re not mistakes. They’re part of the deal.</p>

          <p>I was just preparing a demo for an upcoming talk and it suddenly occurred to me that cascade layers would be a perfect solution to a problem I was having.
For any element of live coding, I like to meticulously prepare my demos to prevent any moments of friction on the day. I wanted to apply a bunch of default styles to a grid of cards in this container queries demo, but I wanted those styles to appear at the bottom of the stylesheet, so that when it came to live coding the demo I could write all the relevant code at the top, and the audience could just focus on the layout styles I would be discussing. However, there were a few styles that consequently wouldn’t be applied, as they would have been overridden by those further down. For example, at the top of the CSS file I want to apply a con…</p>

# What is FLEDGE?
FLEDGE is a proposal to serve remarketing and custom audience use cases while protecting user’s privacy. When FLEDGE executes the ad auction between buyers (DSP) and sellers (SSP), the client receives real-time signals from the FLEDGE Key/Value services. Real-time signals are critical because they provide information, such as the budget for a buyer, when a bid is calculated. They can also provide information about an ad creative to a seller, to help decide which ad is shown to the user. Without these signals, buyers and sellers are not able to conduct basic operations that the ad industry relies on.

          <p>Suppose that HN user Foo wishes to DM user Bar. HN knows their real email addresses, so Foo emails Bar@hndm.com, and HNDM auto-forwards this to Bar&#x27;s real email address. If Foo wants a response from Bar, Foo needs to tell Bar their (Foo&#x27;s) real email address, and Bar can email them directly. The only accepted/understood direct reply to one of these forwards is &quot;block&quot;, which will forever block Foo from sending to Bar. If Foo gets three blocks, they&#x27;re disallowed from sending HNDMs until the they are under three blocks, which clear at one block/week.

          <p>One aspect of web development I’ve always loathed was working with forms. Form elements have been traditionally difficult to style due to OS and browser differences, and validation can be a nightmare. Luckily the native HTML APIs added methods for improving the form validation situation. With input[type&#x3D;number] elements, you can add min and max attributes. […]

          <p>The top layer sits above its related document in the browser viewport, and each document has one associated top layer. This means that elements promoted to the top layer needn&#x27;t worry about z-index or DOM hierarchy. They also get a neat ::backdrop pseudo-element to play with. The Fullscreen API spec goes into more details as Fullscreen was a great example of the top layer in use before dialog support came along.
The top layer helps solve the problem of rendering content above the rest of the document.
The important things to remember:
Top layer is outside of the document flow.
z-index has no effect in the top layer.
Each element in the top layer has a styleable ::backdrop pseudo-element.
Each element and ::backdrop generates a new stacking context.
Elements in the top layer are stacked in …</p>

Static Site Generation is actually a topic I know nothing about. In all my years I&#x27;m yet to use one. Luckily we have Zach with us to show us the ropes, and to showcase his project 11ty, a JavaScript-based static site generator. Join us as I learn the ins and outs of a whole world that lives within the build step.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32540102 target="_blank">Ask HN: Suggest rigorous ways to learn design of data structures and algorithms</a>
          <p>By seriously I mean both the theory and the practical. The theory of how to actually design and analyse algorithms. And also implement them in a language. The language shouldn&#x27;t matter while thinking about algorithms.
At the moment I am not opting for something like leetcode. I want something that teach me the principles of how to actually design from the fundamentals.
Also I want to be as much language agnostic as possible. By that I mean the ability to think about algorithmic solutions to problems in terms of mental models that I can then translate to a low level language like C, or a dynamic imperative language like Python, or a functional language like Racket, SML or OCaml. Of course, the assumption here is that I must know the language I want to implement the algorithm in. So basically I want to learn about algorithms in a paradigm agnostic way so that I can implement them in any paradigm I want.
How to go about this? Do you have any book or course suggestions in mind?

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32530595 target="_blank">Find Unused CSS Across Entire Web Project [Local]?</a>
          <p>Hoping the collective wisdom of HN can help me with this one:
I&#x27;m currently archiving a site for a client which was built in WordPress [I know! I know!] by creating a static version from it. So I&#x27;ve used &#x60;curl&#x60; to download the entire site and spent a few days stripping out the tangled mess of WordPress cruft.
Next in my sites is the CSS. I&#x27;ve consolidated the eleventy billion CSS files strewn throughout WP into one central CSS file, which is about 3000 lines long. And now need to strip out all the unused selectors... of which I suspect there are many, because the site is mostly just plain text articles with occasional illustrations. No fancy-schmancy stuff at all.
Plenty of advice on the web about using Chrome Dev tools to check for unused CSS against a single page. But this is a site of 500+ pages, so I need something that will crawl the entire project and compile a list of all the CSS used/unused across the entire site.
On the face of it this seems like one of those horribly repetitive tasks which would be a nightmare for a human to do, but trivial for a computer. A solution wouldn&#x27;t even need to automagically strip the CSS out. Even just marking the used elements would allow me to see what was required or not and manually delete the rest. Pseudo-code-ually:
  for HTML file in project 
  look for class&#x3D;XXX or id&#x3D;#YYY
  look through project CSS file for .XXX or #YYY
  insert comment /*this is used in file ZZZ.html*/

          <p>Rebasing is a frequent task for anyone using git. We sometimes use rebasing to branch our code from the last changes or even just to drop commits from a branch. Oftentimes when trying to push after a rebase, you’ll see something like the following: hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch […]

          <p>My wife and I recently submitted to a mobile game jam on Newgrounds (yes, it&#x27;s still around). What started as a question of whether we could do it somehow morphed into whether we could do without so many of the seemingly needless complications rampant in our respective industries. My wife thus did all the art as traditional frame-by-frame animation (no puppets or tweening) and I preceded without a game engine. I did use a pre-processor that gives JS a Lisp syntax (Parenscript), because C-syntax is gross. We hope the end result, while definitely of small scope, will serve to inspire some thought as to what is and isn&#x27;t needed in your next project.

I wonder if people would be interested in a weekly UI/UX design challenge over email. And where I pick one or two submitted designs to provide deeper analysis and tips on how to make it better and why.

          <p>Last month, at Lazy Load, Paul Calvano gave a presentation where he dove deep into HTTP Archive to uncover some common performance mistakes. One of the issues he explored were sites that preloaded resources that never actually end up being used by the page.
The preload hint is a way of indicating to the browser that a particular resource will be needed for that page, and that the browser should request it now, when the preload hint is encountered, rather than waiting for later discovery. When used selectively and sparingly it can be a great way to help resources that the browser won’t discover in the HTML itself—a background image referenced in CSS, a JavaScript file injected by a script loader, etc—arrive much earlier.
Unfortunately, like anything, it can also be misused and the consequen…</p>

Every brilliant design starts with an amazing idea, as well as hundreds of not-so-amazing ones. To the user’s eye, these rejected concepts aren’t at all visible, however, their experience would be nowhere near as delightful if mistakes, iterations, and learnings didn’t happen during the design process.
In the Double Diamond, a familiar framework and close friend to the design community, the third stage is where the brainstorming and ideating really kick off.

          <p>Following on from the previous announcement, support of HTTP/2 Server Push will be disabled by default in Chrome 106 and other Chromium-based browsers in their next releases.
# Why is this being removed?
HTTP/2 Server Push allowed websites to proactively send resources needed by the page instead of waiting for them to be requested. However, it was problematic as Jake Archibald wrote about previously, and the performance benefits were often difficult to realize. As a result, it was not used much with only 1.25% of HTTP/2 sites making use of this feature.
Analysis of the use of HTTP/2 Server Push has mixed results (Chrome, Akamai), without a clear net performance gain and in many cases performance regressions.
Push was not implemented in many HTTP/3 servers and clients—even though it was inc…</p>

          <p>Chrome DevTools makes debugging CSS grid layouts intuitive with a variety of visualization options.


Watch the video to learn how to toggle the grid overlay in the Elements panel and use it to:
Visualize and inspect grid layouts.
See row and column numbers to refer to when placing grid items.
Use line and area names and see them on the overlay if you have a lot of grid items and the numbers are confusing.
Check track sizes.
Additionally, with the Grid Editor in the Elements &gt; Styles pane, you can align items and their content in a grid layout with a click of a button instead of typing CSS rules.
For a more hands-on learning experience, follow the Inspect CSS Grid tutorial.</p>
