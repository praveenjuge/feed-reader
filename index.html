          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35223553 target="_blank">Ask HN: Semantic” CSS Framework?</a>
          <p>When I make applications on my own account that are server-side rendered I frequently use CSS to style things in a way similar to what I think CSS was intended for initially,  that is,  I apply styles to meaningful parts of the document (e.g. &quot;div.statusbar&quot;, &quot;table.postlisting th&quot;.)
Frequently I work on these things on and off for months or years and eventually they become a hot mess.
I&#x27;m looking for something that will help me have some discipline.  I do not like BEM, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and other frameworks that want to impose alien structures on CSS.  I like the intention of SASS/SCSS but don&#x27;t like the idea of complicating my build system.  (I like the idea of CSS Nesting as it works in Chrome but Firefox doesn&#x27;t have it yet unfortunately.  I want to use the latest features but I need support for Firefox and Mobile Safari with Chrome as a distant third.)  I would consider using a JS polyfill and I am using jinja2 template so anything I can bake into my python back end (maybe compile &amp; cache compiled CSS) would be possible.
Any advice for frameworks or other organizing principles?

They gleefully made stuff up every week. They had a few filing cabinets of stock photos, and they invented stories featuring UFOs, […]</p>

I have decided to seriously start using RSS feeds. The signal v/s noise
ratio of the internet is no longer acceptable for me.
I hope to prepare a default list, as a starting point; based on your recommendations below.

          <p>Looking for feedback. This is an MVP built on GPT. I&#x27;d love to hear people&#x27;s feedback on the quality of the Jira tickets this tool is creating. 
The purpose of the tool is to save hours spent on writing Jira tickets and bring clarity to what&#x27;s supposed to be built by Engineering. 
This tool works for front end products for now.

Think Google Sheets or Airtable, but on your relational database. We provide a collaborative UI on top of Postgres, MySQL and other databases, enabling teams to view, edit and visualize their data.  Here’s our short demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;38RslBYdZnk
Accessing data is a challenge to team members who aren’t data analysts or engineers. Databases are usually locked down to a few team members, and everybody else has to rely on them to get access. Most non-engineers can’t (and don&#x27;t want to) use developer tools, and developers don&#x27;t want to write SQL for teammates all day. Technical employees end up being bottlenecks for ac…</p>

A motor on a computer chip

I watched a video where Carl Bugeja is prototyping a PCB motor. A PCB motor the size of a quarter seems… ahem… revolutionary when it comes to creating small movable parts. Carl is up against a lot of physical limitations in this quest to blend mechanical and electrical engineering; namely temperature. If the temperature goes to high, the device melts and fails and that is bad for the success of his invention.

This also helps protect users from cross-site tracking by preventing reporting rendered URLs that don&#x27;t meet the minimum threshold.
This protection is referred to as 𝑘-anonymity, and is enabled by a centralized server operated by Google that maintains global counts. Once a creative meets the minimum threshold, it is cleared to be rend…</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/android-webview-header-privacy/ target="_blank">Improving user privacy by requiring opt-in to send X-Requested-With header from WebView</a>
          <p>When a user installs and runs an application that uses a WebView to embed web content, the WebView will add the X-Requested-With header on every request sent to servers, with a value of the application APK name. It is then left to the receiving web server to determine if and how to use this information.
We want to protect the user&#x27;s privacy by only sending this header on requests if the app developer explicitly opts in to share with services embedded within the WebView. To achieve this and let current online services that depend on this header migrate away from using it, we will run a Deprecation Origin Trial, while removing the header for general traffic. In parallel, we will be developing new privacy-preserving APIs (such as client attestation APIs) to match the use cases where the X-Requested-With header is being used today.
You can read more about why we&#x27;re making this change and how it works over at the Android Developer&#x27;s Blog in Improving user privacy by requiring opt-in to send X-Requested-With header from WebView.</p>

          <a href=https://remysharp.com/2023/03/11/i-had-a-good-week target="_blank">I had a good week [blog]</a>
          <p>Though it&#x27;s only been a few days since my last entry I got to the end of that week and took some stock and realised, aloud, that I had a good week.
Again, this is for me and those who know me. The usual tech nonsense will resume (one day!).

I hadn&#x27;t written anything on my blog for a while, or at least nothing that had flowed naturally so my &quot;flavour of funk&quot; post did come easily and it was good.
The Monday before that post (the evening before) I attended a (nearly impromptu) meetup run under Beyond Tellerrand from Marc Thiele and Storyblok. I saw friends who I&#x27;ve not seen in, what felt like a long time. I felt physically sick the whole time, in my guts but seeing talks, hearing ideas, seeing my friends faces - it was overall positive.
The next day I finally returned to the gym. It was gentle and I wrote the aforementioned blog post on the treadmill. It flowed out of me and the responsive was warm and friendly (thank you).
That evening I also had dinner with a long standing friend. So long that we agreed that we&#x27;d meet on the same day every month - which makes making sure we see each other much easier. It was nice, and they&#x27;d read my post (and are probably reading this post too, so hey ❤️).
Finally on the Thursday I started individual therapy (or counselling) properly (I&#x27;d had an introduction session the week before). I realised, and had to think carefully about it, that I had had a good week.
In the week that followed (last week), I&#x27;ve been trying to focus my thoughts on positive things to tell myself. I&#x27;m working on quietening down Bob&#x27;s voice in my head, and when it&#x27;s quiet, I&#x27;d like to begin to fill that emptiness with positive things, nice things, in my head.
It&#x27;s still early days, like those early pages in a book, those first weeks on a diet or at the gym, but it&#x27;s positive. I&#x27;m hopeful.</p>

          <p>Hello, I was wondering what computer monitor setup helps your productivity for game design. Do you use one curved monitor? Or multiple square monitors? Or some combination? Personally, I use two and had been thinking it is annoying not to have a dedicated area for code, game engine, api, chatgpt. It seems like a difficult balance to see proper information at once.

          <p>Do I need to get an EE master’s (VLSI focus, interested in this field) to understand the field better so that I can use AI to improve chip design and manufacture life cycle (as a CS grad)?
I am a cs grad, but I liked electronics since first year&#x27;s summer break when I took a practical course in electronics, then I played around with embedded systems &amp; ai &amp; robotics and web dev&#x27;s study materials for all of my college years and never got past any intro course in any of them. now after graduation I feel like I know nothing and interested in a lot of things and not being able to decide what to choose. now I am interested in both ai &amp; vlsi and can&#x27;t decide between:
1.using ai to automate the build process of ic chips. or,
2.using vlsi to design ai-specific chips to advance the field more and more.
being ignorant about both fields, I can&#x27;t make a decision. and I feel like I have to study both no matter what order of the two I pursue. so, I chose to start with ai as a tool for solving problems and then later in my career I pursue an MS in EE to understand the kind of problems in this field and how to solve it using ai. and this order is safer for me, giving my cs background, than to shift my career to EE as a fresh grad.
does this make any sense, or I am just wasting my time for lack of experience to decide?
and what is the job title for something like this? is it related to a VLSI CAD engineer?

          <p>Hey HN,
Similar to resumes, traditional job descriptions feel outdated. There is a lack of standardization in the industry, some mention compensation, some mention hard requirements, some are more flexible in requirements.
I&#x27;m curious if you were to build a job description standard, what types of fields would you want included? Some ideas of the top of my head:
- Compensation Bands
- If hard requirements are present, an explanation of why (i.e we don&#x27;t have capacity for mentorship, so we are looking for X years of work experience)
- LinkedIn of the hiring manager
- LinkedIn of the existing team
- A detailed over of the interview process
Would love to know what others think!

The pivot into a more service-oriented business model as a B2B innovation and tech company comes with a new brand identity, including an updated logo to shift perceptions of the company from a mobile phone company. The new logo has a more geometric and abstract approach, balancing visual evolution and instant recognition.
Some say that the “new Nokia” resembles a distant echo of the original logo since so many elements have been stripped away. A bold graphic was used throughout all content, repurposi…</p>

          <p>Beginning gradually in Chrome 113,
storage, service workers, and communication APIs will be
partitioned in third-party contexts.
In addition to being isolated by the same-origin policy, the affected APIs used
in third-party contexts would also be separated by the site of the top-level
context. Sites that haven&#x27;t had time to implement support for third-party
storage partitioning can take part in a deprecation trial to temporarily
unpartition (continue isolation by same-origin policy but remove isolation
by top-level site) and restore prior behavior of storage, service workers, and
communication APIs in content embedded on their site.
In addition to a general unpartitioning deprecation trial, it&#x27;s possible to
participate in a focused deprecation trial just for window.sessionStorage.

  Transitions created with the View Transition API. Try the demo site–Requires Chrome 111+.



Warning
In our efforts to work on future enhancements to this feature, we broke it in Chrome Canary. Oops! But hey, that&#x27;s what Canary&#x27;s for. If you want to try view transitions today, use stable Chrome 111, or beta Chrome 112.
These kinds of transitions were a frequently-requested feature from developers, including me, and I think we&#x27;ve managed to land it in a way that balances good defaults with extensibility and customization. That sounds like we&#x27;re patting ourselves on the back, but developer feedback was key to the design of this feature. An earlier pro…</p>

# Replay extensions support
The Recorder introduces support for custom replay options that you can embed into DevTools with an extension.
Try out the example extension. Select the new custom replay option to open the custom replay UI.
To customize the Recorder to your needs and integrate it with your tools, consider developing your own extension: explore the chrome.devtools.recorder API and check out more extension examples.

          <p>Federated Credential Management API (FedCM) is a
web API for privacy-preserving identity federation. With identity federation, an
RP (relying party) relies on an IdP (identity provider) to provide the user an
account without requiring a new username and password.
FedCM is a purpose-built API that allows the browser to understand the context
in which the RP and IdP exchange information, inform the user as to the
information and privilege levels being shared and prevent unintended abuse.
# Updates
There are a few updates to Chrome&#x27;s FedCM implementation:
For the ID assertion
endpoint, IdPs need to
check the Origin header (instead of the Referer header) to see if the
value matches the origin of the client ID.
A new Chrome flag

          <p>Hi HN!
I am quite excited as this is my second product, launched today: Versionfeeds.
https://versionfeeds.com
What is Versionfeeds? I was quite annoyed by the fact that I had no central place where I could see all the software releases. I use software a lot, be it at my job, to build my side projects, or tools hosted on my NAS at home. It&#x27;s literally dozens, if not hundreds of tools, packages or even programming languages. And most of them receive updates regularly.
That is why I built Versionfeeds. It allows me to bundle all the releases for the software I need and love, into one dedicated feed. At the moment, all public repositories on Github and Gitlab are available. You can also search on npm (Javascript) and Packagist (PHP) for your software. More providers will come soon.
The feeds adhere to the Atom standard and can be consumed with any feed reader. If maintainers use markdown in their release notes, it will be converted to HTML.
Any feedback, wishes and ideas are welcome. Please share your thoughts with me. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35069802

          <p>Hello
I’m the author of the library.
I wonder if people will be interested in learning how this library is working. Should I make a video about it? WDYT?

          <p>I&#x27;m planning on making a small web app using SSR rather than splitting the backend and client work. In researching options for the project (Go based), I&#x27;ve &quot;discovered&quot; that there&#x27;s a _lot_ more to templates than what I&#x27;ve used in the past (Jinja2 via Django, Flask, and Ansible).
So to the actual web developers here, what template engines do you use and why? I&#x27;ve never worked with compiled templates but they seem interesting, though I don&#x27;t know their cost/benefit tradeoffs very well yet.
Your choice of language, stack, syntax preference, what-have-you! I&#x27;m just genuinely curious about the broader templating ecosystem and workflows.

          <p>When it comes to web design and development, PHP frameworks are a popular choice for their reliability and efficiency. Laravel and Symfony are two of the most widely used PHP frameworks, and they both have their own strengths and weaknesses.
If you’re a web designer, developer, or team working with clients, it’s important to determine which framework is best suited for your project. Choosing the right framework will save you time, increase efficiency, and ultimately improve collaboration between designers and developers.
In this article, we’ll compare Laravel vs. Symfony, and provide guidance to help you choose the framework that’s most appropriate for your next project.

          <p>Writing code can be repetitive, and many developers (myself included) opt to make our lives easier by configuring our code editor of choice to auto-complete common statements in the given coding language.
My own preferred editor, VS Code, includes Intellisense out of the box, which provides common code snippets for auto-completion as you type. Pressing Enter or Tab inserts them into your code.
Perhaps you need something more custom? There are many extensions in the VS Code Marketplace that provide snippets in a variety of languages. Personally, I use Sarah Drasner’s Vue VS Code Snippets extension, which includes a whole bunch of snippets for Vue.
Writing our own snippets
But we can also create our own snippets! To try this out, let’s create a snippet for a min-width media query — something…</p>

Creating smooth transitions on the web is a complex task.
The View Transitions API is here to make the creation of polished transitions simpler by snapshotting views and allowing the DOM to change without any overlap between states.

          <p>Building UI used to be fun when there were limited choices. You would use bootstrap and sass/less  or css modules, and just get things done.
Now there are just so many options to choose from and such a feeling of FOMO.
Each new one that comes out and moves up the rankings (https://2022.stateofcss.com/en-US/css-in-js/) makes me feel a need to evaluate it. There is always a little benefit from each new framework but then it also can make other things harder.
I really just want nice pre-built components to use.
Tailwind has great components and templates, but its such a mess too look at when you want to deal with dynamic styles, and is slow to compile with webpack and tricky with monorepos, and then you have to use things like twind, twin.macro, windicss.
I miss the days of jquery + sass so badly. It was so straightforward. Nested css for everything and then when you need complex stuff: just use jquery to add/remove styles.
Every single new framework has so many edge cases that just wear you down. Styled Components and Emotion seemed so great, but just so many freaking edge cases, and perf issues.

          <p>I made a ChatGPT client that is contained in 1 HTML file. Would love to know what you guys think.
The idea is to have something very simple to use that people can just download and use. If they want, tweak as per their liking. (You will need an OpenAI API to use it).
- It doesn&#x27;t call or use any 3rd party services (except jQuery and Bootstrap loaded from a CDN). Use your own API key, call the OpenAI API directly in its normal functioning ( there is a chatbot feature to pull top HN headlines which calls the HN API ).
- Its just an HTML file, so you can run it from anywhere.

          <p>Fonts are a defining characteristic of the design of any site. That includes WordPress themes, where it’s common for theme developers to integrate a service like Google Fonts into the WordPress Customizer settings for a “classic” PHP-based theme. That hasn’t …

          <p>A user’s clipboard is a “catch all” between the operating system and the apps employed on it. When you use a web browser, you can highlight text or right-click an image and select “Copy Image”. That made me think about how developers can detect what is in the clipboard. You can retrieve the contents of […]

          <p>The cross-company Capabilities Project (code name Project Fugu) at Google has the objective of making it possible for web apps to do anything platform-specific apps can. Apart from Google, project partners include Microsoft, Intel, Samsung, and others. The project enables amazing web applications like Photoshop by exposing the capabilities of the underlying operating systems to the web platform, while maintaining user security, privacy, trust, and other core tenets of the web.
But what are examples of apps that make use of these capabilities? Our answer to this question is the Project Fugu API Showcase. It is sourced by community submissions, and contains a filterable list of apps that make use of one or more of the Fugu APIs.
Propose missing apps to the showcase by submitting them via an anonymous form. Submissions are reviewed regularly and the showcase will be updated accordingly.
After living in an embedded iframe that didn&#x27;t really allow the showcase to fully shine, we have now worked on migrating it to a new home, and have polished its look and feel a fair bit, too. Find the Project Fugu API Showcase at its new location developer.chrome.com/fugu-showcase!
Launch each app by clicking its name, screenshot, or the Launch app link. For many apps, you can also see the source code by clicking View source. On browsers that support the Web Share API, click Share app to do exactly that. As a special inception Easter egg, the Project Fugu API Showcase is of course contained in the Project Fugu API Showcase.
Be sure to subscribe to the RSS feed so you never miss a new Fugu app.</p>

Supply your own API key and chat away. You can also save sessions to a file and continue at a later time. Be forewarned that it is very much a proof-of-concept and unpolished.

          <p>I am experimenting with a smart RSS reader that filters my feeds.  One of my favorite sources is The Guardian, which is strong on world news and particularly the UK and Australia.
Although watching the decline and fall of the remnants of the British empire is quite entertaining and The Guardian has some US news I feel I am not getting enough US news in my mix.
There are numerous things I like about The Guardian such as:  (i) their outlook (but I like The Economist also which leans right of The Guardian),  (ii) quality of reporting, (iii) volume of output, (iv) substantial text (but not too much) in the feed, and (v) no paywall.
Are there good RSS feeds for US news that share some of these attributes?

          <p>The things we do each day, every day, often arrive without intent. By the time we realize that they’re now habits, these random behaviors have already become part of how we define ourselves and the time we spend. Bringing intent to our rituals gives us the chance to rewire our attitudes. But first we need […]</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35023234 target="_blank">Ask HN: Is web design still worth learning in the age of no-code tools and AI?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;ve been considering learning web design for some time now, but with the rise of no-code tools, templates, and AI-powered website builders, I&#x27;m starting to wonder if it&#x27;s still worth it.
I understand that having a strong understanding of design principles can give me more flexibility and customization when it comes to building websites. However, it seems like more and more people are using no-code tools and templates to quickly create websites without the need for any specialized knowledge.
So, is learning web design still worth it in 2023?

          <p>Olivia Hoskin
      Writer &amp; Design Enthusiast 

There’s nothing like reminiscing on your first job. For many, it may have been babysitting, working in food service, as a camp counselor or instructor, or even tutoring. A first job is memorable because it’s often your first taste of independence, earning your own money, or a moment of entrusted responsibility.
Landing your first design job is no different! You may even feel more sentimental about your first design job. While your first job may have been mainly motivated by financial gain (nothing beats those hard-earned babysitting bucks), your first design job was likely more intrinsically valuable.
And if you’re still working towards landing your first design job, this one’s for you! We asked our community how they landed their first desi…</p>

          <a href=https://www.inthezoneapp.com/ target="_blank">Show HN: In The Zone – An app to boost productivity and fight interruptions</a>
          <p>The Zone is the state where you are completely focused and fully productive. It takes time to get there, but the slightest distraction can knock you out of it and you have to start over.
So I built this app to track productivity and measure the impact of interruptions.
This is how it can help:
• Launching the app and starting to get in the Zone is a commitment to work. It can prevent you from procrastinating and is a good motivator to actually start working and to keep distractions away.
• The timer can help you decide if it’s a good time to take a pause because you’ve been in the Zone for a long period, or if it is better to continue working because you’ve just entered the Zone.
• Your colleagues will notice the color change from yellow to red. This is a great signal that helps them understand the impact of interruptions on your productivity.
• Statistics help you measure your daily productive time.
• Using your phone for other purposes is considered an interruption by the app, so that’s already one distraction taken care of.

          <a href=https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar target="_blank">Show HN: Mathesar – open-source collaborative UI for Postgres databases</a>
          <p>Hi HN! We just released the public alpha version of Mathesar (https://mathesar.org/, code: https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar).
Mathesar is an open source tool that provides a spreadsheet-like interface to a PostgreSQL database.
I was originally inspired by wanting to build something like Dabble DB. I was in awe of their user experience for working with relational data. There’s plenty of “relational spreadsheet” software out there, but I haven’t been able to find anything with a comparable UX since Twitter shut Dabble DB down.
We&#x27;re a non-profit project. The core team is based out of a US 501(c)(3).
Features:
* Built on Postgres: Connect to an existing Postgres database or set one up from scratch.
* Utilizes Postgres Features:  Mathesar’s UI uses Postgres features. e.g. &quot;Links&quot; in the UI are foreign keys in the database.
* Set up Data Models: Easily create and update Postgres schemas and tables.
* Data Entry: Use our spreadsheet-like interface to view, create, update, and delete table records.
* Data Explorer: Use our Data Explorer to build queries without knowing anything about SQL or joins.
* Schema Migrations: Transfer columns between tables in two clicks in the UI.
* Custom Data Types:: Custom data types for emails and URLs (more coming soon), validated at the database level.

          <p>The web platform allows users to share their screen using the Screen Capture API. Chrome’s implementation of getDisplayMedia() includes a media picker through which users may choose to share any tab, window, or screen. Starting with Chrome 107, we experimented with a small modification of that dialog, putting tabs as the first option, to encourage users to share tabs and away from sharing their entire screen. This relies on the well-understood concept that the way a question is phrased influences the distribution of answers. This is known colloquially as Nudge Theory, and known to children as “pretty please.” After some initial bumps, the experiment proved to be a great success, and we have now shipped this new experience to all users.

          <p>My son Otis wants me to help him make a video game. When he says “we should make a game”, he means “me” because despite a lot encouragement from his parents he hasn’t shown interest in coding classes. I also have a lot going on with the whole “starting a company” deal, so I was hesitant to pick up another big project… but he’s persistent and I’ve been in the mood to make a video game.
We sat down one evening to write out a game design document. After capturing the who, the what, the when, the where, and the “how it’s fun” we had a rough idea for an open world 3D game that was like Breath of the Wild but Link is a dog and it has online co-op.

A summary of our scope document:
Who: Dog and Cat
What: Walk around in a 3D open world, get weapons to fight bad guys, find items and easter eggs, so…</p>

          <a href=https://css-irl.info/a-native-visually-hidden-class/ target="_blank">A Native “Visually Hidden” in CSS? Yes Please!</a>
          <p>If you’ve been writing CSS for any length of time, the chances are you’ll have come across situations where you need to hide some text visually, but still have that text available to assistive technologies (such as screenreaders). Icon buttons and skip links are just two examples. (There are plenty more.) Simply using display: none hides text from assistive technologies, which is not useful to us in this scenario. So developers over the years have come up with clever ways to hide text visually, which usually manifest as a utility class that gets copied and pasted into every project, often called .visually-hidden or .sr-only — something like:
.sr-only {
  border: 0 !important;
  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px) !important;
  -webkit-clip-path: inset(50%) !important;
  clip-path: inset(50%) !important;
  height: 1px !important;
  overflow: hidden !important;
  margin: -1px !important;
  padding: 0 !important;
  position: absolute !important;
  width: 1px !important;
  white-space: nowrap !important;
}
It’s so common that even popular CSS frameworks like Tailwind come with built-in .sr-only classes.
But as Ben Myers points out in this excellent article on why the web needs this as a native feature, there are problems with this. One issue is that there are many variations on this snippet, which have been found to cause problems as browsers and have evolved over time. Ben argues that it’s about time this became a native feature, and I absolutely agree. In the article, Ben outlines some of the advantages and drawbacks to the various forms this might take, such as a value of the display property, a property all of its own, or a HTML attribute. I recommend giving it a read, and hopefully something will come out of it 🙂

          <p>How do you currently tether one element to another? You might try tracking their positions, or use some form of wrapper element.


  I’m the anchor
  
I’m the anchored thing

/* styles.css */
.container {
  position: relative;
}
.anchored {
  position: absolute;
}
These solutions often aren&#x27;t ideal. They need JavaScript or introduce extra markup. The CSS anchor positioning API aims to solve this by providing a CSS API for tethering elements. It provides a means to position and size one element based on the position and size of other elements.
# Browser support

          <a href=https://hlog.pro/ target="_blank">Show HN: hLog.pro (a Hacker News archiver with a card based UI)</a>
          <p>I wrote a simple site that uses the HN API to save new submissions. Even if they&#x27;re deleted on Hacker News, they&#x27;ll be saved on hLog. It looks for new posts every 3 minutes.
It also has a basic search that looks at the title, url and submission text (if any).
It&#x27;s not optimised in terms of pagination of results (nor the actual page content). If you press &quot;Search&quot; without anything in the search box, you&#x27;ll get a list of all the records in the database. There are around 4,200 right now.
I wrote it in Python (Django) using SQLite3. It runs on a free VPS hosted on Oracle Cloud. I wrote this mainly to improve my understanding of Django. I&#x27;m mainly a backend guy but i want to build some frontend skills and i thought a project like this would allow me to learn that.
Any feedback would be much appreciated, even if it&#x27;s negative. I know there are hundreds (if not thousands) of HN mirrors/clones out there, but this is for my learning. If you could suggest any improvements, i may be able to learn new things i otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have.

Nick Babich, an Israel-based UX and product designer, has had an unlikely assistant in his workflow of late: ChatGPT, the viral AI chatbot.
Over the last few weeks, Babich has asked ChatGPT to write dummy copy for his app and website designs, sketch out layouts, and even generate font and color pairing ideas. Since its launch in November, Babich says he’s been able to integrate the chatbot “in almost all areas of product design that don’t require creating media content.”
ChatGPT’s primitive interface, developed by the Microsoft-backed research firm OpenAI, which counts Elon Musk as its co-founder among several others, has become a familiar…</p>

          <p>Here’s a breakthrough that’s about to happen somewhere: A GPT that reads every email that anyone in your organization has ever sent and makes it easy to ask it questions about what the entire organization knows. A person could probably not find the time, bandwidth or privacy constraints to do this. But this accessible but unembarrassed database tool could quickly become a huge asset for any organization that installed it–even a soloist. Tell me who I know or what I know about XYZ… Or consider the power of a network. If my colleagues opt in, I can simply ask the […]</p>

          <p>I recently dusted off a relatively old (~5 years) MacBook and replaced the battery with the plan that I could use it as a secondary machine, for my “non-work” stuff. The last couple of times I’ve got a new Mac I’ve gone for the option of cloning my old setup, so I don’t need to install everything again. This time, however, the whole point was to keep things simple, minimal and (hopefully) fast, so I decided to completely wipe it and start from scratch.
If you’re a developer, naturally there’s a bunch of stuff you need to install to get your environment perfectly right for coding. The following is the process I went through to install the things I need for my setup, written purely to remind me what I did, when I inevitably have to do it again sometime.

          <p>Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State (CHIPS) is a Privacy Sandbox technology that allows developers to opt a cookie into &quot;partitioned&quot; storage, with separate cookie jars per top-level site.
CHIPS is being developed with the goal to become an open web standard. It is under discussion in the PrivacyCG and has had an origin trial for 7 months during which the Chrome team has received helpful feedback. During development the team worked with key stakeholders to explore that feedback, resulting in an updated design that better serves the web ecosystem.
Let&#x27;s explore two challenges that the Chrome team faced in implementing CHIPS and how community feedback played a key role in evolving the proposal design.

          <p>It&#x27;s been a good few weeks that I&#x27;ve been in this head state, a dark funk that clouds my reality. I&#x27;m a depressive, have been for as long as I can remember. But the down sometimes, go deep down and it&#x27;s dark down here.
I&#x27;m writing this for myself, but also partly for those close to me to see a little inside my head. Maybe also to bleed out some of the bad stuff in my head too.</p>

If we looked, really saw what was happening, we’d have to change our minds, admit we were mistaken, refactor our priorities or take action. It’s so frightening that we even hesitate to make a list of the things we don’t want to look at. Because the list itself is frightening. If we don’t see it, it feels safer.</p>

          <p>Starting in Chrome 110 (February 2023) we are gradually introducing a fixed value for Android version and device model—the default value will always be Android 10 on a model K.
If you rely on the user-agent to detect a visitor&#x27;s operating system version, Android device model, or detailed browser version then you may need to take action—read on for the details.


The user-agent is a string that provides information about the user&#x27;s browser and their environment—like knowing that a visitor on your site is running Chrome version 110 on Android.
Your browser sends this in an HTTP header and makes it available via JavaScript.
The problem with full user-agent string is that it shares detailed information about the browser by default on every request which is a major factor in allowing cross-site…</p>

          <p>One of the ongoing challenges in the web standards community is ensuring respectful, inclusive, and constructive conduct in standards discussions. We&#x27;ve seen good technical discussions derailed when participants stop listening to each other; we&#x27;ve also seen dominant voices shut out interest from newcomers who don&#x27;t feel included.  Even among those of us who have been doing this for a long time, it is all too easy to answer bluntness with curt responses, and curt responses with rudeness; unfortunately, this escalates disagreements, and makes collaboration impossible. Several of us in the Chrome team set out to work with the community to develop some insights into how to improve. We hope to encourage the broad adoption of more respectful and productive interactions by setting a good example …</p>

          <p>Sites that load fonts with font-display: swap often suffer from a layout shift (CLS) when the web font loads and is swapped with the fallback font.
You can prevent CLS by adjusting the dimensions of the fallback font to match that of the primary font. Properties such as size-adjust, ascent-override, descent-override, and line-gap-override in the @font-face rule can help override the metrics of a fallback font allowing developers more control over how fonts are displayed. You can read more about font-fallbacks and the override properties in this post. You can also see a working implementation of this technique in this demo.
This article explores how font size adjustments are implemented in the Next.js and Nuxt.js frameworks to generate the fallback font CSS and reduce the CLS. It also demon…</p>

          <p>I&#x27;ve got many, many USB A to USB micro cables and I still have a good number of devices that make use of the micro connection.
The USB (2) port generally have four wires - ground, power and then D+ and D- (for data exchange). USB micro has a 5th line, though when it&#x27;s connected to USB A on the other side that 5th line isn&#x27;t connected.
My problem is that I also have a boat load of power only USB cables - and there&#x27;s no way to tell using a visual inspection. You can buy tools that tell you if there&#x27;s a data line, but I can make one fairly simply.

I should caveat this with the fact that I just happened to have the parts laying around.
In short
The device is an LED power a battery power source and the USB&#x27;s data wire is used to complete the circuit.
Parts

Protoboard
USB A port
USB micro port
LED
220ohm (ish) resistor
Battery (I used a game boy cartridge battery - again I had them laying around)

Wiring
In my version, I&#x27;ve included separate LEDs and checks for both the D+ and the D- but it&#x27;s not really necessary - if D+ isn&#x27;t there, neither is D-.
The pinout on the USB ports is the important detail, the outside pins (far left and far right) are VCC and ground (which we don&#x27;t care about). The centre pins are what we&#x27;re interested in. The centre pins will make up the circuit.

Result
Now I have a simple tool that can help me weed out those pesky power-only USB cables!</p>

In our lifetimes, it’s become possible to imagine that you could even make a living creating pop. But pop is a harsh mistress, because pop means popular, which is, by definition rare and unfairly distributed.

          <p>As we continue to face difficult choices and work to make things better, it’s quite likely that the alternatives being presented aren’t ideal or even appealing. Many organizations and communities are stuck because “none of the above” is the majority’s opinion, or perhaps the desire of those in power, or those with loud voices. But unless you’re willing to acknowledge that you’re simply being difficult, “none of the above” comes with the responsibility to describe a path that’s better. Because forward is the best option.

          <p>Just going through the backlog of some old projects and found this Filament Group gem that went unpublished!
Flex Luthor is a small CSS wrapper library to help with responsive intrinsic-sized Flexbox layouts that wrap based on content and container width (avoiding viewport-based media queries).
Demo
Source Code
This library predated Flexbox support for the gap property but I updated it to use gap in the new v3.0.0 version. I think the coolest feature it provides is the addition of borders only when cells wrap to a new line (horizontal, vertical, or both).
Install #
Available on npm

          <p>Hey,
… And I’m back in town your inbox with quite a few new reading recommendations for you. It’s quite interesting how the web continues to bring new stuff each week, how developers explore these new things. A lot of the CSS features we currently get make using CSS easier, make a property’s purpose clearer and some reduce selector complexity (always a good goal). Other ones enable complete new product ideas, especially in the JavaScript API field, and others disrupt the current status quo of building web apps (Page Transitions API, SPAs and MPAs).
For a short time, I’ll be changing my usual monthly publishing routine. The current issue started with over seventy links that are worth including. So I’ll start with a smaller list and you will likely get the next edition next week already. Whe…</p>

          <p>Edge just showed me a (huge) ad within the browser UI (between the address bar and web view):
&gt; Take your AI-powered copilot for the web on the go! Download Microsoft Edge on your mobile device to sign-up and get ready for the new Bing experience!
This is especially irritating because there&#x27;s no reason to show me this ad--I already use Edge as my primary browser on mobile (because the latest iOS update made Safari start losing its scroll position when going back to a previous page).
Between this and the frequent repinning of an Edge icon to my Windows desktop (every single update), I&#x27;m fairly annoyed.
Does FireFox do this kind of annoying stuff? Is there another browser I should try?
Edit: I&#x27;ve seen small &quot;ads&quot; before in Edge (like &quot;try this new feature&quot; or &quot;oh no, please don&#x27;t install Chrome&quot;), but never just a literal huge banner ad.

Use AI to create faux intimacy. Get the word out. Burn trust. Get more attention. In the last forty years, the amount of promotion has gone up exponentially. At the same time, the success of promoted content, products and services hasn’t increased at all. That’s because the secret isn’t to focus on your promo.

However, the containment spec includes more than just size queries; it also enables querying a parent&#x27;s style values. From Chromium 111, you’ll be able to apply style containment for custom property values and query a parent element for the value of a custom property.
This means that we have even more logical control of styles in CSS, and enables  better separation of an application’s logic and data layer from its styles.

          <p>I feel like I often find myself wondering &quot;How do other people do this?&quot; when I need to solve some larger system design question. This usually leads to Google, which usually leads to a bunch of ads. Sorting through this is not the best experience.
Stack Overflow is also sort of subpar for these sorts of questions - as its short form, and frankly just doesn&#x27;t contain much of the content I&#x27;m looking for.
I think I&#x27;d love a mostly-correct ChatGPT modeled as a system design expert. The current iteration seems kinda shallow, unless my prompts just suck.
How do other people go about doing this research?

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34914897 target="_blank">Ask HN: A fast, Rust HTML parser that works?</a>
          <p>So I&#x27;m doing some web scraping in Rust, and so I will need to parse HTML. [scraper](https://docs.rs/scraper/latest/scraper/) (which uses [html5ever](https://github.com/servo/html5ever)) is doing fine except that it&#x27;s the bottleneck of my application.
So I need a faster parser. I&#x27;ve tried [tl](https://docs.rs/tl/latest/tl/) which would&#x27;ve been perfect except that it doesn&#x27;t actually work on the HTML I have. When I try to &#x60;query_selector&#x60; the elements I need, it returns nothing.
[Kuchiki](https://docs.rs/kuchiki/latest/kuchiki/) is abandonded.
I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get [lol-html](https://github.com/cloudflare/lol-html) to work for me (it&#x27;s designed for re-writing HTML, whatever that means). It doesn&#x27;t seem to have an API to extract the inner text of an element.
[html5gum](https://github.com/untitaker/html5gum) seems to be just an HTML tokenizer, or otherwise just too low-level. I have not yet tried [quick-xml](https://github.com/tafia/quick-xml/) but judging from the README, it&#x27;s pretty low-level too. I mean, if these are the only options left then I will try them. Otherwise, I would love to use a parser that&#x27;s faster but as ergonomic as &#x60;scraper&#x60; or &#x60;tl&#x60;.
At this point, I would be happy with an Lxml bridge/port of some sort. I don&#x27;t need to mutate HTML, just parse and read data from it.

          <p>After 2022, it’s hard to tell for sure. And going forward, public life is going to be even more rumor-driven than it is now. Any video, any voiceover, any photograph–we can’t be sure. If YouTube or the Wayback Machine shows us that it happened after 2022, bring some doubt. AI and digital cools can produce a perfect voiceover, edit a video, forge a document… There have always been forces at work that prize disrupting our civic systems. But thanks to AI and digital deepfakes, it’s significantly easier to create and spread a story that simply didn’t happen. A speech that […]</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/devtools-tips-20/ target="_blank">DevTools Tips: Discover CSS issues</a>
          <p>Have you ever applied CSS to an element but it just doesn&#x27;t work?
With Chrome DevTools, you can discover CSS issues at a glance, debug, and test them.


Watch the video to learn how the Elements &gt; Styles pane highlights various CSS issues:
 Property with invalid syntax
 Overridden property
 Inactive property 
Inherited from parent
 Inherited property
 Non-inherited property
 Expandable shorthand property 
 Overridden longhand property
 Active longhand property
user agent stylesheet
Non-editable property
Overridden non-editable property
More debugging tips:
Use the filter in the Styles pane to focus on the one property that interests you.
Use the Computed pane to see all the Cascade winners and their computed values.
In the Computed pane, expand a property and click a link to find its source in the Styles pane.
To learn more about all the ways DevTools highlights CSS issues, see Find invalid, overridden, inactive, and other CSS.
To level up your CSS expertise, see Learn CSS.
To learn how to create websites that look great and work well for everyone, see Learn Responsive Design.</p>

          <p>I love the stack and am curating a list for myself in case I ever want to apply for jobs.
Companies using Tailwind in particular attract me because they tend to have the same build fast mindset I have so its also an indirect filter for culture. What do you think?
Also - If you can think of any cool companies using Next/Tailwind/Both please do comment/PR. :)
Note: I am trying to only add companies that are early stage/ startups and use it for their main product (one off web pages don&#x27;t count)

          <p>Hey, guys. I&#x27;ve just made a plugin which turns your pandas dataframe into a tableau-style component. It allows you to explore the dataframe with easy drag-and-drop UI.
You can use PyGWalker in Jupyter, Google Colab, or even Kaggle Notebook to easily explore your data and generate interactive visualizations.
PyGWalker (pronounced like &quot;Pig Walker&quot;, just for fun) is named as an abbreviation of &quot;Python binding of Graphic Walker&quot;.
Here are some links to check it out:
The Github Repo: https://github.com/Kanaries/pygwalker
Use PyGWalker in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/asmdef/pygwalker-test
Feedback and suggestions are appreciated! Please feel free to try it out and let me know what you think. Thanks for your support!

          <p>My wife and I did a poor job sharing Christmas wishlists with each other this year. It dawned on us how our hobbies (hers tennis, mine gunpla) are so specialized we either A) have the stuff we need or B) our needs are so specific or subjective that even gifting a ballpark guess of what the person wants doesn’t actually help and would probably create more work.
SungWon Cho (aka, ProZD) sums the situation up perfectly in his short bit “before and after you discover the subreddit for a hobby”…

The Reddit-ification of hobbies is real. Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok are waiting to rapture you and radicalize your innocent hobbies. And the more niche your needs become, the more expensive as well. The internet has obliterated the $20 casual gift. It’s $400+ or GTFO.
So we text each other links of an exact item, the stock counts of rare item across 20 sites, the exact time window the of the group buy, but ugchk, you’d need my login so that it’s tied to my account, so how about you just Venmo me $400 instead from our shared bank account?
We’ve cut the sails of gift giving. Online wishlists try to meet this need, but are always out of date, so you need to nudge the person to update their wishlist, spoiling the surprise, so that you can buy the first item at the top that meets your budget.
And the immediacy of Amazon Prime has ruined the suspense of gift giving. Why wait a month for something when I could have it in two days with free returns? The idea of a gift giving holiday reeks of an old world activity like reeling film through a projector to watch a movie with no sound. The immense effort for a demonstrative show of attention on a pre-planned day.
So that’s my take, the internet has ruined gift giving. The only safe gift going forward is homemade bread from your pandemic bread hobby. But be sure the yeast is single-sourced and stored at precisely 45ºF like its hometown in the mountains of Bavaria.</p>

          <p>It’s a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.
Read more about RSS Club.

I don’t talk about this much, but since February 24th, 2022 I’ve spent ~2hrs a day following the war in Ukraine. My heart breaks and sensitivities to injustice rise over this David vs. Goliath scenario where greedy authoritarians bomb peaceful civilians indiscriminately.
Ukraine has fought valiantly over the past year. Their cities and infrastructure decimated. Their homes and apartment complexes the targets of expensive cruise missiles. Mass devastation for what? The Russian government lies to its citizens and punishes them for seeking or speaking the truth. The government-sponsored media says its “necessary”, propaganda about “nazism”, manipulation over “satanism” and overt xenophobia, leaving yo…</p>

          <p>I had a free night on the calendar, so I tumbled out of my office with a stack of necessary supplies: a laptop in case I wanted to blog (or work more), my iPad in case I wanted to watch YouTubes, a gunpla set and all my tools in case I wanted to hobby, and a book or two in case I wanted to read. I got in the house and let out a sigh “What am I doing?!” I wish I could say this was an isolated event, but it happens often. The likelihood I do any of these activities beyond my iPad is miniscule.
Carrying that pile of distractions, my brain flashed back to college. Living in an enormous house with seven roommates and at least one freeloading vagrant, I was paying $200/mo in rent to sleep in a literal closet in South Austin. To focus, I’d leave the house and walk over to the coffee shop: Bouldin…</p>

          <p>Hi HN,
nudedisco is a simple album discovery tool I created to aggregate album reviews from a number of my favourite websites and blogs.
As someone who spends most of his professional life working with React and &quot;modern&quot; frontend stacks, it was a lot of fun to go back to basics and create a server-rendered website.
The site uses Elixir under the hood and is deployed to fly.io.
The code is available on my GitHub profile: https://github.com/soulprovidr/nudedisco
If you have any thoughts or suggestions, I&#x27;d love to hear them.
Thanks, and enjoy!

          <a href=https://www.noya.io/home target="_blank">Show HN: Noya – A new kind of design tool</a>
          <p>Hi HN. I&#x27;ve been working on a new browser-based design tool that&#x27;s ready for you to try.
The idea is you work on your design in low fidelity wireframes, while still getting a high fidelity output that you can share or use as a reference for your implementation. The way it works is by mapping low fidelity blocks you draw into high fidelity design system &amp; React components.
I spent several years working on design tools at companies like Airbnb, and I think the ideas behind many of the tools we built for designing at scale could really help startups and small teams as well. I would love any feedback you have!
PS: Most of Noya is open source at https://github.com/noya-app/noya
