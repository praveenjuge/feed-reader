          <p>It came to my attention that my site does not appear on DuckDuckGo search results. Even when searching for “daverupert.com” directly. After some digging, DuckDuckGo used to get their site index from Yandex, but now gets their site index from Bing and sure enough… I didn’t appear on Bing either.
First of all… rude. I’m the one person I know who actually uses Bing and I started using DuckDuckGo on my Mac… and they have the audacity —nay, the cowardice!— to shadow ban me and my contributions to the Web!? I —a southern gentleman— take the highest offense at this slighting and misconstruing of my character. I do declare.
SEO isn’t one of my top objectives with this site, so initially I dismissed it. But that nerdsnipe shot a signal flare up in my brain that spun into mystery I needed to solve. …</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34383168 target="_blank">Ask HN: Are you glad you&#x27;re using Material UI (React library)?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;m normally someone who builds my core React components for a given project from scratch; it&#x27;s not hard and I have maximum control if needs change (and don&#x27;t have to go read a bunch of docs)
But right now I need to build a boring admin interface for somebody, with limited time to dedicate to it and it doesn&#x27;t matter what the look and feel is or anything. So I&#x27;m considering pulling in a library like MUI so I can more quickly just bang out an interface and move forward
Question is: does Material UI&#x27;s convenience outweigh the extra complexity of adding a dependency, reading its docs, learning its conventions, etc? Especially for a relatively quick and simple thing
(MUI-specific anecdotes only please; not interested in speculation or in discussions about the broader question of whether to add a dependency to a project)

          <a href=https://macaron.js.org/ target="_blank">Show HN: I made Macaron – Type-safe CSS-in-JS with zero-runtime and colocation</a>
          <p>Hey HN, my name is Mokshit and I&#x27;m really interested in web-performance and web-development. At the time of writing this, I&#x27;m a junior in high school.
Macaron is a typesafe CSS-in-JS library with zero runtime, colocation, maximum safety and productivity.
The motivation behind it is that runtime CSS-in-JS libraries, that is most of the CSS-in-JS libs, add alot of bloat to web apps and have a considerable performance drop with a bundle size increase. Alot of them also don&#x27;t support more performant ways of building web apps like streaming markup. Most of the current compile-time CSS-in-JS libraries try to fix this, but have some or the other drawback like not offering colocation, or not being type-safe.
Today, Macaron does all this with a compiler that extracts all the style declarations at compile-time and converts them to static css files while also letting you author the type-safe styles in the same file as your application code. It supports both - a vanilla styling API and a styled-component API with support for multiple frameworks like SolidJS and React and build tools like Vite and Esbuild. Macaron is currently missing a webpack plugin, but that will also be published soon, making it compatible with almost all bundlers.
There&#x27;s a ton of room for improvement in this space, and I feel like macaron is a step in that direction.

          <p>There are 3 primary reasons why one human may be more effective than another in a given work situation.
Caring - All things being equal, somebody who cares more about a problem / product will generally be more effective1.  Caring can range from “startup founder” level obsession to being completely checked out, and effectiveness will vary on that spectrum.
Capacity - The amount of time and mental resources a team member can bring to a problem matters and will vary over time.  Illness, stress, a busy personal season or competing work priorities can reduce this temporarily for anyone.  Some people will have longer term lower capacity than others due to factors like life circumstances, health, and outside of work commitments.
Leverage - People’s skills, experiences, tendencies, relationships a…</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/iframe-credentialless/ target="_blank">Iframe credentialless: Easily embed iframes in COEP environments</a>
          <p>Iframe credentialless is enabled by default from Chrome version 110. It solves the most common complaint developers working with Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP) have: embedding third-party iframes that do not set COEP.
It was previously available as an origin trial from version 106 to 108, and known as anonymous iframe.
# Why we need COEP
Some web APIs increase the risk of side-channel attacks such as Spectre. To mitigate that risk, browsers offer an opt-in-based isolated environment called cross-origin isolation, which requires deploying COEP. Cross-origin isolation allows websites to use privileged features including SharedArrayBuffer, performance.measureUserAgentSpecificMemory(), and high-precision timers with better resolution.
To enable cross-origin isolation, websites must send t…</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/cookie-max-age-expires/ target="_blank">Cookie Expires and Max-Age attributes now have upper limit</a>
          <p>As of Chrome release M104 (August
2022) cookies can no longer set an
expiration date more than 400 days in the future.
This change does not impact session cookies—cookies that do not explicitly set
an expiration date with Max-Age or Expires—as these are instead cleared when
the browsing session ends.
With this change, Chrome caps the expiration date to the maximum allowed value:
400 days from the time the cookie was set. Cookies that request an expiration
date further out than 400 days aren&#x27;t rejected; their expiration date is set to
400 days instead.
# Example
For example, consider a cookie set on Sunday, January 1, 2023:
Cookie
      Requested expiration
      Days in future
      Over 400 days?
      Effective expiration

Initial letters are large, decorative letters that have been used to start new sections of text since before the invention of printing.

I don&#x27;t want this: https://hnrss.org/frontpage because it show in my RSS feed two links to articles and comments. I just want feed of those articles with previews, just like other feeds that I&#x27;m used to subscribe.

          <p>Basically from a “quality triangle” perspective – execs can control costs or time, but holding the line on a minimum quality bar is essentially a core piece of my job, and nobody wins when you try to promise impossible combinations of scope/quality/dates.</p>

# About SQLite
SQLite is a popular, open-source, lightweight,
embedded relational database management system. Many developers use it to store data in a
structured, easy-to-use manner. Because of its small size and low memory requirements, SQLite is
often leveraged as a database engine in mobile devices, desktop applications, and web browsers.
One of the key features of SQLite is that it is a serverless database, which means that it does not
require a separate server process to operate. Instead, the database is stored in a single file on
the user&#x27;s device, makin…</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/audiocontext-setsinkid/ target="_blank">Change the destination output device in Web Audio</a>
          <p>Until now, setting the destination audio output device was only possible for  and  with HTMLMediaElement.setSinkId(). In Web Audio, AudioContext used the default device, leaving the user to change the system audio output device manually.
From Chrome 110, you can use AudioContext.setSinkId() to programmatically direct the audio output in Web Audio to any permitted device.
This is especially helpful in a variety of real-time communication scenarios. For example, a web app can use this to programmatically direct output to a specific audio output device such as a Bluetooth headset or speakerphone.

First, you need the identifier of the audio output device you want to use as a destination. Get the list of available media devices with naviga…</p>

          <p>I’ve been a full-time professional web developer for 17 years. In that time, I’ve seen things.
I remember when web browser developer tools were first introduced, using Firebug for the first time.
I predate even the WebKit mobile revolution: a time when proxy browsers reigned supreme and Blackberry was king.
I bore witness to the React schism, ruthlessly popularizing Single Page Apps and clientside rendering; giving rise to a slower web in the name of developer experience.
I embraced the npm revolution.
I rode the waves of Node.js.
I webpacked across The Great Divide.
The Great Divide #
The Great Divide really resonated with me. I keep coming back to it and I do think it continues to accurately describe what feels like two very distinct and separate camps of web developer.

          <p>I’ve come across several products that automatically convert Figma designs into code. From what I see, they do a good job of generating React components and CSS from Figma designs.
It seems to be that these should be the standard way to make frontends, but it is not. Why is that? Am I missing something?

          <p>As a software engineer, on my own I’ve been able to increase my efficiency and productivity at my current job over the years with the help of various programs such as command line interfaces (CLIs), GUI extensions (VS, VS Code, Chrome), software applications, and other shortcuts (aliases, etc.).  I know everyone has different preferences and work styles, but I can’t help but think what I’ve been able to apply would be useful for other developers at my company.
Undoubtedly, there are other developers at my company have their own set of programs/workflows they use to increase their efficiency that I think could be useful to me and others.
I&#x27;m curious to know what strategies other developers use or have used within their company to share productivity tips and programs with their colleagues. For example, is there a dedicated Teams/Slack channel, an internal wiki, or some other type of software where engineers can share/demo programs and shortcuts they use in their day-to-day work?

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34330134 target="_blank">Ask HN: Consolidated RSS feeds for independent blogs?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;ve been experimenting with a smart RSS reader and I&#x27;ve been using Superfeedr to ingest content.  Superfeedr monitors RSS feeds and calls a webhook when content arrives,  I stuff these into an Amazon SQS and then spool them out at my leisure.
My system requires a fairly high volume (1000&#x27;s of articles) to train a machine learning model so I have been focusing on high volume feeds like preprints from the arXiv,  news from the Guardian, etc.
Now Superfeedr charges 10¢ per feed per month,  my bill right now is $3 a month.  It&#x27;s reasonable that I can subscribe to about 100 feeds on Superfeedr but subscribing to 1000 feeds seems pricey to me.
There are a lot of independent blogs out there that publish an article every week or every six months.  What they all have in common is that somebody has to poll an RSS file many many many times per article ingested.  W/ superfeedr it makes for high costs but it is a hassle even if I built my own RSS ingest system.
One thing that would help would be consolidated RSS feeds that aggregate posts from a large number of blogs.  Are there good ones out there?  Are there other answers to problem of polling hundreds or thousands of independent blogs?

# Recorder: Copy as options for steps, in-page replay, step’s context menu
Open an existing user flow in the Recorder. Previously, when you replayed the user flow, DevTools would always start the replay by navigating to or reloading the page.
With the latest updates, the Recorder shows the navigation step separately. You can right-click and remove it to perform in-page replay!
Apart from that, you can right-click a step and copy it to the clipboard in the *Recorder panel instead of exporting the whole user flow. It works with extensions too. For example, try to copy a step as a Nightwatch Test script. With this feature, you can update any existing script with ease.

          <p>Form validation has always been my least favorite part of web development.

There used to be a correlation between superior performance and price. In 1900, an Hermes saddle or a Louis Vuitton trunk was arguably better built for the work it was put […]</p>

          <p>Hi.
I&#x27;m curious, how do you prefer consuming RSS news feed?
Do you prefer text-oriented News Aggregators like the HackerNews website or image-oriented ones with a small text/description layout?
Personally, reading small text only like HN page sometimes I feel there should be more customization to config view for user preferences, but I don&#x27;t need images preview out there.
What about you?

          <p>At one point during the construction of my house, we needed designs for the kitchen and bathroom cabinets and a bedroom wardrobe.
I wanted full control of the design process. Doing it in vector illustration software was too painful and it was taking too long. But I didn&#x27;t have the time to learn any complex CAD tool either.
So I developed a small HTML/JS/CSS tool for designing MDF furniture by writing my own little language that transpiles into a CSS grid layout.
Take a look at the blog post for details:
https://alnvdl.github.io/2023/01/07/designing-furniture-usin...
Or go directly to the tool (works best on desktop or tablet): https://alnvdl.github.io/squareplanner/

          <p>It’s a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.
Read more about RSS Club.

After a good long hem n’ haw about Texas politics my friend Daniel filled a conversational pause by jokingly asking…
“So what’s good?”
A question made in jest, but it has stuck in me like a knife. I now see my ability to complain everywhere. On the walk to school with neighbors they ask how it’s going, “Ughck. I’m busy”, or “Ughck. It’s hot”, or “Ughck. Kids putting on shoes, amirite?!”
I’m trying to figure this out. It’s starting to bother me because I don’t believe myself to be a negative or overly pessimistic person. But there are times I hear the vibe-killing “Debbie Downer” sludge pouring out of my mouth.
The best I can come up with is…
I think it’s easier to complain? My negativity bias bubbling to the surface. Is it easier for humans to commiserate on bad circumstances rather than celebrate good ones?
It’s an attempt to self-deprecate? Life is going good but I don’t want you to think it’s going too good.
My engineering brain? I spend every day finding and predicting problems, is my brain over-tuned to find problems?
Either that or I’m a big ol’ StrongSad. Hm.</p>

          <p>What - I am working on a specification/language which can describe a traditional system design process for web-services.
Why - Having a language for system-design will improve design interviews and system documentation. It can also give rise to &quot;Competitive Designing&quot; industry same as &quot;Competetive Programming&quot; exists currently.
How - I am exploring existing specs (Docker-compose, OpenAPI and UML) and a way to merge them. They will define the system.
For the actual execution, I will use the spec to setup a sandbox environments and run blank instances of services in them. Then I would use custom defined API flows from the spec to simulate an actually running system.
This is not the hard part. The hard part is finding a way to benchmark these API flows which gives reliable scores for the effectiveness of the system for a given problem and API flows.
Happy to discuss more.

I&#x27;ve been loosing weight successfully in the past but I have the impression it impacts my productivity and my mood: I get tired, I have low energy, even lethargic.
I want to remove the excess kgs again in next 6 months and would love to hear your hacks to dieting without loosing my positive energy.
Many thanks!

I haven’t done a yearly review in a few years. Looking back at those old posts, it seems like I wrote some very bland listicles that wrapped up the different web development community work and side projects that happened during the year. This year I’m just gonna write free-form and see what happens 😅.
Open Source #
Probably the biggest news this year is that Eleventy graduated from side project to full time sponsorship (thank you Netlify!!) in February and everything changed.
Looking back at the before-times, I’m not sure how I managed this project without full time sponsorship.
The most important thing I’m doing in my life is being a dad. I’m reminded of the Jamstack Conf panel a few months back. The moderator asked panelists “What do you like to …</p>

          <p>Psst… I’ve been keeping a secret. As part of my Web Components course on Frontend Masters, I built an entire guidebook on how to get started with Web Components. A Web Components 101. I spent hundreds of hours preparing the materials for the course and I’m excited to announce that today I’m making the guidebook public for everyone to get started with Web Components.
Read the Guidebook
This guidebook is different! Most Web Component resources drop you right into the JavaScript parts. Ughck. That’s fine, I guess, but seeing the markup for a  component doesn’t make my heart or brain sing. It also doesn’t help me understand one of Web Components’ biggest mental hurdles: The Shadow DOM. To overcome this, I’ve intentionally designed my course to build out layer-by-layer from HTML→CSS→JavaScript, like how old timers learned the web development in the past.
Starting with  and  –and most certainly with Web Component styling– you become familiar with the quirks of Shadow DOM first before writing your own from scratch. Following the navigation from left-to-right you’ll learn the ins-and-outs of Using → Styling → Writing the different flavors of Web Components. And because it’s part of the Web Platform, that knowledge will always be valuable.
HTML-first may seem overly basic, but I find that lots of new and experienced developers alike have never even tried using a Web Component off the shelf. That’s my favorite part of Web Components! You can use lots of Web Components without a build process or any kind of Webpack sorcery. A script tag + HTML and you’re using them! Web Components make it easy to (dependably) use other people’s code.
You can of course still watch my Web Components course on Frontend Masters. I recommend it if you’re an visual or auditory learner like myself. There’s also a bit more back-and-forth with the live audience and their questions.</p>

          <p>As seen with things like open source software, many developer tools, Hacker News as a website and people&#x27;s opinions on CSS and modern web design on places like Reddit?
Cause it feels like many people&#x27;s tastes come from the 80s/early 90s, with the idea that any sort of visual flourish or attempt at readability is completely irrelevant.
And it makes me wonder why this is. Why do so many... hacker type individuals seem to prefer very brutalist, utilitarian designs over anything more fancy? Where did this preference for plain text at the expense of all else come from anyway?
Because I don&#x27;t think this happens quite as much in other fields, like architecture, cooking or construction.

          <p>Hey all, I&#x27;m a product designer and I built this cause&#x27; when I was designing liquidity pool and staking features for this DAO, I didn&#x27;t know how the user flow worked and how the UI looked for similar pages, so I was constantly switching back and forth Balancer, Uniswap, and OlympusDAO as references.
I thought that I might not be the only one with this problem, so I built this library of userflow screenshots, and annotated them, to share with the web3 community of builders, designers, and developers.
Would love feedback if you&#x27;re a builder in web3, let&#x27;s connect too!
(Also I&#x27;m aware that there are some that&#x27;ll claim web3 is a scam, but I believe in it, to each their own.)

          <p>The idea that things become hits mostly due to a small number of large audiences rather than point to point viral sharing seems intuitively correct to me: www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/viralit…
Or at least the large audiences “seed” the viral behavior</p>

          <p>As employees return from holiday break, [Shopify] said it’s conducting a “calendar purge,” removing all recurring meetings with more than two people “in perpetuity,” while reupping a rule that no meetings at all can be held on Wednesdays. Big meetings of more than 50 people will get shoehorned into a six-hour window on Thursdays, with a limit of one a week.
This is fascinating to me.  I get the desire to remove bloated meetings, but there are recurring meetings that I find genuinely valuable to have sync (project standups / staff meetings).  Curious if this ends up being a long term policy for Shopify or more of a culture reset.</p>

          <p>I read 13 “work related” books in 20221. They’re broken up by category below.  I didn’t think any of these books were bad, but the ones I would recommend have a star next to them.
Decision Making
⭐ How To Decide by Annie Duke - Annie Duke takes her poker background and applies it to making decisions in other contexts – lots of practical decision making strategies here
⭐ The Scout Mindset by Julia Galef — somewhat similar ground to to “How You Decide”, but more of a focus on viewing the world objectively.  I really enjoyed reading these 2 books together.
Productivity
⭐ Make Time by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky — A nice book full of practical tips for managing your time and reclaiming control from distractions
Product Process
⭐ The Messy Middle by Scott Belsky — The best description of what …</p>

Stacking viruses ran through our kids over the course of three weeks. My immune system was shaky but held on. It culminated in ear infections in both kids and I learned the city of Austin has a shortage on antibiotics. New, incredible ways the American healthcare system can fail that I never anticipated.
This month ended in some sadder news that after a series of tests and treatments we’ve learned that our 13 year old dog Rudy has Transitional Cell Carcinoma, a form of bladder cancer that is inoperable and non-responsive to radiation and chemo. The outlook is not good, a matter of weeks or months, and we’re already at weeks. Holding out hope the k…</p>

          <p>Spent the last 3 years in home office where I have a standing desk setup. Came into a coworking space today with no standing desks. Feel like I’m half asleep. I can’t be any more than 50-60% as productive as when I was standing!
Crazy that we know sitting is bad for you. How much productivity change, if any, have you felt if you’ve tried switching to stand up work?
Also, what an easy win for a lot of companies, if productivity changes 10-20% plus on standing desks, what an incredible easy boost that is.

Work
At the end of 2021 I started a new job as Senior Front End Developer at Ada Mode, a data science and AI company working in the renewable energy sector. It’s been a great year for the company, as we’ve taken on a bunch of exciting projects and continued to make a name for ourselves. The year has been full of interesting challenges and learning opportunities for me personally, working with Vue and D3.js in particular, (and AWS, which has been less fun 😅) and it’s been a pleasure to work with the friendly and knowledgeable team. I’m looking forward to the company continuing to grow in 2023 as we hire new developers and begin projects spanning sustainable agriculture, wind energy, nuclear decommissioning, solar power an…</p>

          <p>Another year has come and gone. I can’t believe it. I think I’ll look back on 2022 as a year of milestones. It’s been a year of new jobs, new challenges, new products, and new hobbies. This is my second year piecing my year together from my monthly vibechecks. I think I’ve boiled those posts down to some major themes from the past year.
My new job at Luro

The biggest change this past year is my employment, I’m working full-time on Luro. What began as a side project app has grown into it’s own little stealth startup. And when I say startup, I mean startup. Over the course of the last year, we took a bit of pre-seed investment, made our first hires, re-architected the app, and onboarded our first round of private beta users.
There have been ups and downs starting a SaaS business in the head…</p>

          <p>let&#x27;s say I am using Tailwind CSS (licensed under MIT) in my website by using the npm package &quot;tailwindcss&quot; which on build creates a css file. According to MIT - &quot;The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.&quot;.
The css file that is created has a comment on top &quot;/* ! tailwindcss v3.0.23 | MIT License | https://tailwindcss.com */&quot;
Is that sufficient? or do I need to include the whole MIT text or do I need to make a /license page and write about it there &quot;tailwindcss is used in this website, licensed under MIT - full MIT license here&quot;? if not, how do I do it correctly?
I saw some sites like which seem to use tailwindcss but in the devtool sources only have the top line in the css &quot;tailwindcss v3.0.23 | MIT License | https://tailwindcss.com&quot; is that a violation of the MIT license?

          <p>Finally feeling like society around me has settled into it&#x27;s stride, even many normal things have happened, but as I write my last blog post of the year (as I&#x27;ve done for over a decade), I&#x27;m not entirely happy with how I feel like my blog has been neglected.
Work
Since the pandemic hit us back in early 2020, I&#x27;ve been working (mostly) flat out because we really didn&#x27;t know what would happen to the economy.
My typical work contract would be, at most, a few months, but instead I&#x27;ve been working very long term with clients. This is really good for our security but not something I&#x27;m used to and I can see the impact it&#x27;s had on my creativity around side projects that I&#x27;d normally work towards.
More obvious (to me) is my lack of blogging and really the motivation to write has gone utterly kaput.…</p>

We started with assigning events to specific elements, then moved to event delegation for efficiency, but did you know you can identify elements by position […]

          <p>It’s one thing to know about what’s in the browser document, it’s another to have insight as to the user’s browser itself. We’ve gotten past detecting which browser the user is using, and we’re now into knowing what pieces of the browser UI users are seeing. Browsers provide window.personalbar, window.locationbar, and window.menubar properties, with the […]

          <p>Media queries provide a great way to programmatically change behavior depending on viewing state. We can target styles to device, pixel ratio, screen size, and even print. That said, it’s also nice to have JavaScript events that also allow us to change behavior. Did you know you’re provided events both before and after printing? I’ve […]

          <a href=https://www.rssbrain.com/ target="_blank">Show HN: RSS Brain</a>
          <p>I wrote an RSS reader called RSS Brain recently. The motivate is the current RSS readers either don&#x27;t sort articles by priority, which makes it hard to read posts from HackerNews and Reddit, or sort it with some &quot;smart&quot; algorithm which I don&#x27;t trust. I also like the Google News feature that can show related story from different source, but the sources are not configurable and the algorithm is not transparent either. So with RSS Brain, I implemented these features:
* Recommend related articles from the feeds of your choice. It&#x27;s backed by ElasticSearch and the algorithm is described on RSS Brain&#x27;s website.
* Option to sort articles by upvotes and time. The algorithm is similar to the old Reddit and you can find it on the website as well.
* Save search terms into folders so you can filter the articles.
I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and found these features very helpful. So I want to share this on HackerNews. The frontend is written in Flutter so it has cross platform clients, even though the web version don&#x27;t feel very &quot;web native&quot; because the level of Flutter web support. I guess only time can improve that.
I don&#x27;t have enough hardware to scale it up so it&#x27;s currently in subscription mode to limit the users. I&#x27;m going to open source the code (maybe non-commercial license) once I think it&#x27;s ready so you can host it by yourself. It&#x27;s still in early stage and haven&#x27;t been tested by a lot of people. So any feedback is helpful. Thanks!
Update: Added a scroll down hint in the landing page. Thanks for the feedback.

          <p>Hi there, I built a chrome extension to grab new posts from social media.
Instagram, twitter, Pinterest, etc don&#x27;t really allow for RSS so I worked on this alternative to get new posts. Hope this might be useful for some of you.

          <p>I am making a feed reader that (i) would like to show you a significant amount of text in the feed and (ii) builds models to cluster and classify the text
In terms of length I like the abstracts of scientific papers on sites like arxiv.org.
I have more scientific papers now than I can stand, so I am looking for high volume RSS feeds of a huge paragraph or a few small paragraphs on any topics:  the subject could be sports or javascript programming, product reviews, any kind of journalism or other non-fiction.
Good length is the first qualification but to feed this beast I would love feeds that get 10, 20 or 50 articles a day.
Any suggestions?

          <p>When it comes to animations on the web, developers need to measure the animation’s requirements with the right technology — CSS or JavaScript. Many animations are manageable with CSS but JavaScript will always provide more control. With document.getAnimations, however, you can use JavaScript to manage CSS animations! The document.getAnimations method returns an array of CSSAnimation […]

          <p>I just downloaded my Google &quot;MyActivity&quot; takeout html file (it&#x27;s a file of all your activity on Google and Chrome that you can download for yourself. It&#x27;s an HTML file).
It was multiple hundreds of MB in size.
I opened it in Notepad++ and searched for &quot;etymology&quot;. I&#x27;m an etymology junkie. And was amazed at how many word/phrase origins I had searched for that I couldn&#x27;t even remember searching for.
The problem was that it was very very slow. I didn&#x27;t expect Notepad++ to choke on such a large file, but it did. (It wouldn&#x27;t open in Chrome, it froze Chrome.)
Any thoughts on what app I should open it in if all I want to do is text search?

          <p>Quite a lot of us tech writers don’t get everything 100% right all of the time. Sometimes a small typo might elude us, sometimes we make the odd factual error despite our best efforts and research. Sometimes we phrase something clumsily, giving the wrong impression, omit some piece of information (intentionally or unintentionally), or perhaps misinterpret something we’ve read elsewhere. I’m as guilty as anyone. Especially on this blog, where I don’t always have time to proofread as thoroughly as I should. I worry a lot about being “correct”, particularly as my readership has increased over the past few years, and always endeavour to ensure my articles are as accurate as possible. It’s part of the reason why writing for others takes me so much longer than writing for myself. I always want t…</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34128451 target="_blank">How to Polish CSS?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;ve came to deep realization that CSS is the most important  thing for building a website. It holds the key to becoming full stack developer or just a backend developer. It&#x27;s everything in frontend.
Sooner or later, you&#x27;ll need vanilla css. You can&#x27;t depend on bootcrap or failwindcss. Your site looks like same if you do so. And many components aren&#x27;t available there.
There are components like carousel, cards hover etc etc..How to polish all these skills?
Is there a course for it?
I try to practice it like randomly, but there are no tutorials. I&#x27;m not at a phase where I can read complex long code and  decode it.

          <p>Firstly, I wish everyone a merry Christmas.
If you log onto Hacker News everyday, you&#x27;ll notice that a lot of changes have happened in the website.
For starters: the navigation bar&#x27;s color has changed to a slightly darker shade of red, rather than the orange background.
The top post numbers are now in alternating red and green colors (christmas colors).
I couldn&#x27;t have been the only one to notice, right? In the beginning I thought something was messed up - only to realize what day it was today.

          <p>I watched the documentary General Magic (mentioned in Tony Fadell’s book Build) about the 1990s Apple spin-off company General Magic that built the iPhone before the iPhone. Ultimately the product was a commercial failure, but the documentary is a wonderful look at product design and what happens when you let talented engineers roam free range. They invented USB, created capacitive touch screen GUIs, and imagined the portable “Post-PC” world before Windows 95 and the Internet were ever popular. Ultimately the product was a failure, too early for its time. How did they build this product? Well the answer is… prototypes.
My favorite part of the documentary is Megan Smith beaming over her cabinet full of hardware prototypes. Her focus on making something people love, an intimate device, is infectious. Her eagerness to blend everyone’s wishes with the harsh reality of available and affordable hardware shows. Starting with off-the-shelf components and inventing if necessary. When describing the product, she’s not talking about megabytes, protocols, and pixels, but talking about the sound, the feeling, the touch of the product and software in people’s hands.
I feel more vindicated than ever that prototypes, put in people’s hands, are the biggest opportunity to capture lightning in a bottle. These people are imagining and building the iPhone 17 years before the iPhone launched. Megan Smith talks like Steve Jobs, but Steve Jobs doesn’t work at Apple or General Magic. We often herald the invention of the iPhone or Android and these magic devices as invented out of thin air or our collective science fiction, but both of those products used by billions of people rose from the ashes of General Magic’s failure. That’s a lot to dwell on. The composting of failures produces rich and fertile soil.</p>

          <p>By now, I&#x27;m done with basics html,css,bootstrap coding. I can build navbar, build a hero section with image and h1 text and a footer. That&#x27;s all.
There are various components in a website though. I&#x27;d like to be able to build any of them whenever required if I&#x27;m in a job.
I wanted to build a timeline using html and css but it&#x27;s not entering my head at all. I&#x27;ve seen codes from multiple websites.
https://imgur.com/a/L7c1Bkj
This is the timeline that I want to build. Looks pretty simple but I&#x27;m unable to build it. How do I deal with stuffs like this? How do I learn these stuffs?
Is there a course that helps to deal with these stuffs? There&#x27;s no point of having learn CSS if I can&#x27;t build these stuffs with my visualization. Please guide me.
The scary thing here is that if I can&#x27;t build these stuffs then there is 0 point of me learning css. And I&#x27;m not going to get any full stack or frontend jobs like that way.

We’re keeping things short and simple in this blog post with deeper dives into the new color modes and more coming in future posts. For now, we want you to enjoy the holiday break and come back next year feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. Keep reading for what’s new and we’ll see you next year!
Dark mode and color modes


Bootstrap now supports an explicit opt-in for creating multiple color modes via the data-bs-theme attribute on the root 
 element. We opted for a data attribute solution so that you can create any number of themes instead of just light and dark. We use a new Sass …</p>

          <p>MailChimp used to send out a client&#x27;s newsletters from RSS feed without issue. A few weeks ago, they started showing up a day later. After weeks of trying to get support to track down this bug, we finally got this response
&quot;Thank you for your patience while my team looks at this. We were able to confirm that the best time range currently to space the blog posts is 10-12 hours before Mailchimp&#x27;s sending time. There just isn&#x27;t enough time between your posts and the feed to pull the new content.
As a best practice, I would plan your content releases a day in advance with this functionality in mind.&quot;
It started with 4 hours, now they are telling us 10-12 hours in advance? My client runs a news site and sends our daily news. It&#x27;s not always possible to even publish content that far in advance. It&#x27;s insane to me that this functionality was working fine, for years. That they have managed to break and instead of fixing are saying just publish an insane amount of time ahead of the newsletter being sent?
I&#x27;m not sure what it takes to get someone&#x27;s attention at MailChimp to actually fix this. Read the RSS feed before sending the scheduled post. Like it used to. Otherwise, what newsletter providers would people recommend replacing MailChimp with?

          <p>You may have already heard of CSS logical properties or RTL adaptations but are still deciding whether to deploy them widely. To help raise your awareness of their possibilities, Nicolas Hoffmann shares his experience of how he and his team at Proton carried out a massive move from CSS logical props to production and how you can consider them from a different perspective in your very own projects.</p>

          <p>We&#x27;re happy to announce the availability of a new feature: HTML Diffs. When you run a test now and you check &quot;Save Response Bodies&quot;, a new option shows up in the drop down of results pages called HTML Diff. Example result.
It shows what changed between the page&#x27;s HTML as sent by the server over the network and the HTML that the browser finally used to render the page when the test was complete. The most common reasons for there being a difference is
generated content - dynamic content inserted into the DOM by JavaScript (think a React app for example)
the browser &quot;correcting&quot; your HTML
Features
You have the option to prettify the HTML before the diff is run, which often helps readability, for example for minified content or otherwise long lines.

in my last newsletter this year, the 13th, I want to say thank you to all of you: Thanks for being my audience, for reading my emails, and articles, sharing them, and giving me feedback. I really appreciate every single email you write to me. Happy holidays and happy new year!

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/early-stable/ target="_blank">Change in release schedule from Chrome 110</a>
          <p>We are making a change to the release schedule for Chrome. From Chrome 110, the initial release date to stable will be one week earlier. This early stable version will be released to a small percentage of users, with the majority of people getting the release a week later at the normal scheduled date, this will also be the date the new version is available from the Chrome download page.
For Chrome 110 the key dates will be:
Beta: January 12, 2023
Early Stable: February 1, 2023
Stable: February 7, 2023
You can keep track of upcoming release dates and included features on the Chrome Status Roadmap, and on the Chromium Dashboard. The beta posts have more details of features, and any deprecations and removals for each release.
# Why are we making this change?
By releasing stable to a small percentage of users early, we get a chance to monitor the release before it rolls out to all of our users. If any showstopping issue is discovered, it can be addressed while the impact is relatively small.
For most developers this change will have little impact. Keep following this blog for up to date information on features and any upcoming deprecations and removals. We aim to bring you any relevant information in good time for you to act upon it, before any change in Chrome.

          <p>Having a lot of discussions about documentation lately. 5 things matter with docs:
Does it exist?
Is it the right info?
Is it delivered clearly?
Is it reliably up to date?
Can people find it reliably?
If your “documentation is bad” make sure you’re solving the right problem.</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34037748 target="_blank">Ask HN: How can I design a generic library that provides its own endpoints?</a>
          <p>I like how ActivityPub can be implemented on any website and provide a good set of endpoints to enable rich, social-media-like content interactions. I&#x27;d love to enable my current website to respond to those requests, but I don&#x27;t want to either use &quot;activitypub-express&quot; or install a full Mastodon (or any other) server just for myself.
My idea was to implement the protocol myself, which would be a nice way to learn it and its problems. But I would also love to make it a library that can be applied by others on their own, already existing websites.
The problem that I am having is that the current methods to implement this kind of pluggable extension involve connecting to one specific back end framework, such as creating an Express middleware.
What I was thinking was:
- Use TypeScript (to leverage the large JS community)
- Make it as vanilla as possible
- Use fetch standards such as the Request and Response objects, which are available natively since Node 18
- Provide multiple adapters for common frameworks such as Express, Fastify, Next.js, Astro, etc
Is this solved elegantly on any other language or framework?

I’m adding a micro blog for shorter posts / to have a central controlled place for my short term content while Twitter meltdowns and everybody sorts out what’s coming next in that space.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34014642 target="_blank">Ask HN: What is the successor to HTML Applications (.hta)?</a>
          <p>Back in the day (late 90s), Microsoft had a format called &quot;HTML Application.&quot;
It was just an HTML page with a &quot;.hta&quot; file extension. Opening such a file would open it in a chrome-less browser, and give the scripting in the page access to the file system.
I used to love these things. I wrote a bunch of little apps in them.
Some examples:
https://medium.com/@anht_59851/html-application-hta-a-gui-for-your-scripting-on-windows-bfaacf2c3bdd
These still exist, but there are problems with them:
1. Coding is a bear. They run in the mshta.exe process, and that spawns an instance of... IE9, I think? There&#x27;s no &quot;inspect&quot; panel, for instance, and errors just pop a modal with no debugging information.
2. Near as I can tell, they use an older version of ECMAScript. &quot;let&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to work, not does &quot;addEventListener,&quot; etc. I kept getting weird &quot;Syntax Errors&quot; for things that appeared to be valid, contemporary JavaScript.
3. I&#x27;m quite sure some security software (like on my laptop, issued by employer), blocks these from executing.
What&#x27;s the current-day equivalent of these?  I want to write an HTML page complete with CSS and JS, double-click on it from my desktop, have it open in a browser instance of its own, and have access to the file system.
I essentially want a way to create little GUI apps, without having to use WinForms.
What am I looking for? Is it Electron?
(Note: I&#x27;m on Windows)
