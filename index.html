          <p>Hi,
I am working on a small game. I have developed simple apps with in game wallet/currency. Want to see what is the best way to implement wallets for tracking transactions like 
  1. Adding money to wallet
  2. Moving wallet amount from user A to user B
  3. Withdraw money from wallet 
  4. Running audits to ensure all transactions are correct
on a Relational DB. Would appreciate your personal experience in desingning this or working with a commercial solution ( doesn&#x27;t charge by number of transactions :) ). One article that I liked but its more suited for a nosql database is by AWS https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/building-a-serverless-wallet-service-for-in-game-currency/

          <p>In recent weeks, a handful of people asked me what’s been happening in Web Components Land. Well, as President of Web Components, I have good news and the state of Web Components is pretty strong right now.
I did my Frontend Masters course on Web Components in April and since then there’s even more positive momentum happening in the Web Components space. Here’s a high-level list of developments over the last 6 months or so:
According to the 2022 Jamstack Survey “Web Components have arrived” (jamstack.org)
Brad Frost talks about web components (bradfrost.com)
Safari is prototyping Declarative Shadow DOM (github.com)
Element Internals is under development in Safari (github.com)
Webkit turned on Constructable/Adopted Stylesheets (github.com)
Eleventy introduced WebC … which isn’t capital-”WC” Web Components, but shares a similar ethos
Enhance.dev is a whole framework built on web components
Web Components Community Group collected their list of top concerns for TPAC
Exciting times. When I filmed my course, these more advanced Web Component concepts (Declarative Shadow DOM, Element Internals, Adopted Stylesheets, etc) were a smidge depressing to talk about because of their unknown Safari status. I could say the technology existed, but provide no roadmap for when it would get better support. But, if I’m reading these standards positions right, hopefully the consumer branch of Safari will support them soon.
On top of more feature support, more tooling is also great news for Web Components. Alternate takes, different ideas, varied perspectives! While it can cause some confusion when navigating the Web Component waters, the more perspectives the better for these little building blocks.

          <p>Coming from WPF and Winform, I find web development to be unnecessarily complex, but I refuse to believe that’s true.
I just want to make a simple web app, no React, Angular or any of that. That can’t be too hard right? I’m sure in large scale, that stuff has its place, but I don’t need it. To me, the browser is the UI framework.
When I Google around to get started, I find obnoxious Medium articles. I don’t want to copy and paste instructions and throw something together without a clue what’s going on. Mozilla has good documentation, but I don’t know what’s a good source to actually get a web app running locally that I can eventually deploy online. Do I really need Node? Compared to WPF/Winform this is a mess, or so I hope not.
I want to make a simple app where users can create and fill out a form. ATC test plans, to be exact.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;33634558 target="_blank">CSS: Not understanding the behaviour of position:static?</a>
          <p>https://codepen.io/pelko/pen/zYaEpqr
I&#x27;m learning responsive design. (Make width     position: static;

    width: 100vw;

  }

This is the behaviour I&#x27;m getting with and without position:static. But I fail to understand why? All information that I&#x27;ve about position:static is that it doesn&#x27;t accept Top,Bottom,Left,Right values.
My teacher say &quot;it is floating without static...normal flow of document&quot; but I don&#x27;t get it.

          <p>I&#x27;ve listened to SID music on and off since the 80s, and mostly from early games and demos. Lately, I have explored more recent music. There are online lists of peoples favorite SID music, and online players, see [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]. Because I have different tastes, I had the motivation to make my own list and UX. So from january 2020 to september 2022, I listened through the HVSC having over 50k songs, resulting in a list of 600-700 favorites. I put together a UX so I can easily access them. This project is mostly for my own enjoyment, but I guess that many others here would also enjoy it. Please let me know if you have suggestions for songs I should reconsider adding, or some feedback on the UX.

          <p>Hey,
it’s crazy how much news we get for CSS this year. But along with it, we get tutorials how to use the new things and how to enhance with JavaScript. It’s nice to see how web development evolves, cross-browser support is great for most of the things and we can focus on building great experiences. The result is for example Mastodon, a communication service built on web standard protocols, independent of big tech companies. Or Pixelfed, or PHP, the language that drives most of our server software. Web Components finally get some traction as more and more vendors of widgets build libraries around it. Thanks to all who help the web standards evolving, who help other people by creating open source solutions, to those who write how-to-use articles and to those who share them. Enjoy this week…</p>

          <p>Hi, I was building a productivity app with some twists for myself and thought to share it with people of HN too if anyone might find it useful.
The basic idea is : 
1) Working together in rooms
2) Track your progress and goals with milestones instead of daily tasks completed because I feel in the end we all have a goal to work towards.
Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!

          <p>Hey all. I don&#x27;t know how many designers are here, but I&#x27;m currently in a bit of a pickle and would like some advice.
I am a recent college graduate that has been trusted with running the design team at a startup. I&#x27;ve been hired as a full-time UX designer and am currently leading a team of three design interns. I have no real experience running a design team, and am wondering how I should best proceed in managing the team. Things have been pretty disorganized, and we recently had a meeting in which most of our time was spent in pretty unproductive disagreement. As the person who is more or less running the design team I feel totally responsible for this, and would like to know how I could best run meetings and assign tasks in order to generate lots of ideas, while making sure discussion stays productive come decision making time. I&#x27;d also appreciate any tips on how to facilitate healthy discussion when discussing differences in opinions. I&#x27;m really new to all of this and a bit out of my element, but I really want to do my best and would appreciate any advice.

          <p>My news diet consists of the following:
* email newsletters (substack)
* selected articles (a lot from Hackernews)
* I also subscribe to some promotional newsletters (events, certain products). Not sure how I would fit these
However, I have been struggling with keeping my inbox clean and readable with the newsletters and am considering to switch to an RSS reader. I have several criteria:
1. I need to be able to add one-off articles to the reader (such as finding an interesting article on Hackernews for later consumption).
2. I would love to be able to add rules. For example, if I don&#x27;t read an article for several days, I would like it to disappear from my inbox (archived) or be marked as read so it doesn&#x27;t clog my reading.
3. Needs to be accessible on computer (web/app) and  mobile (ideally via app).
Would love to hear how other people manage this. I&#x27;m also happy to pay for a good solution here.

          <p>I have been using SideKick browser to manage multiple accounts in one place otherwise switching between Chrome profiles was a pain but recently I figured out SideKick automatically changes my WhatsApp status to &quot;Available (via SideKick browser). Not only this, they also change the status on Discord, Slack, Telegram and many other apps.
This is a Growth Hack for them but this was very frustrating for me to know and especially they don&#x27;t have any authority over my WhatsApp Status.
When I did some reverse engineering, I found SideKick is adding an extension that injects content script on web.whatsapp.com and it changes the WhatsApp status automatically every 3 days or so and then they also send the analytics events to their servers.
They may/may not be doing anything with my data but the bigger question is when people over Internet are using browsers like these, they get full access to what you browse and everything else like Cookies, Passwords, etc.
Even they can stitch your sessions in Incognito if they want in the backend \_(~_~)_/. Who knows.
Browser extensions are still vetted by respective vendors like Google &amp; Mozilla but how do we ensure we are browsing the Internet safely?

          <p>By now you may be familiar with , the Eleventy utility for islands and partial hydration.
One of the tricks  uses to delay initialization of Web Components’ custom elements nested as child content is that it iterates over any :not(:defined) nodes and renames the elements to a non-upgradable tag name ( becomes  before  is defined in the custom element registry via customElements.define).
This works pretty well: it doesn’t require knowledge of which web components exist or may exist at some point in the future and leaves other HTML as is. Though I will admit it is a tad bit unexpected to folks that have tied their pre-hydrated CSS to the original tag name (I’d suggest using a class instead!).

          <p>The scenario is an app that uses a tech giant&#x27;s API to post messages.
+ The app&#x27;s only feature is posting. No reading, searching, user profiles, or any other feature.
+ Users too just want it to post. We can assume many users don&#x27;t want any apps - including this one - to routinely examine their user profiles, followers, or protected memberships on the platform.
+ However - and here&#x27;s the problem IMO - the API&#x27;s /post endpoint forces the app to have &quot;read readuser post&quot; scopes just to call this post-only API. (&quot;Scopes&quot; are OAuth terminology for broad permissions).
Why I think this is bad design:
+ The API fails to differentiate between external access and internal  access. If the API&#x27;s code needs to read profile data before posting, it&#x27;s purely an internal implementation detail. There&#x27;s no …</p>

          <p>Hello all. I am a newly graduated UX designer (Cog Sci major) that is basically leading the design team at a startup. We&#x27;ve recently hired a new development team, and I&#x27;d like to learn more technical skills in order to really understand the development side of the product, as well as to communicate ideas better and to understand our design constraints. I have a little bit of coding experience from school and am using some online tools to learn CSS/HTML/Javascript. I&#x27;m also using some online resources to learn about software architecture. Is this the best way to go about this? What would be some good resources for me to learn this skills? Appreciate it.

          <p>I&#x27;m scraping information regarding civil servants&#x27; calendars. This is all public, text-only information. I&#x27;d like to keep a copy of the raw HTML files I&#x27;m scraping for historical purposes, and also in case there&#x27;s a bug and I need to re-run the scrapers.
This sounds like a great usage for a forward proxy like Squid or Apache Traffic Server. However, I couldn&#x27;t find in their docs a way to both:
* Keep a permanent history of the cached pages
* Access old versions of the cached pages (think Wayback Machine)
Does anyone know if this is possible? I could potentially mirror the pages using wget or httrack, but a forward cache is a better solution as the caching process is driven by the scraper itself.
Thanks!

          <a href=https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2022/11/11/bootstrap-icons-1-10-0/ target="_blank">Bootstrap Icons v1.10.0</a>
          <p>Bootstrap Icons v1.10.0 is here with nearly 150 new icons. This release includes tons of new variants for person, building, and database icons, plus new brands, rockets, road signs, globes, and many more. We’re now at over 1,900 icons!
150 new icons
Here’s a quick look at all the new icons in v1.10.0:


Some highlights for the new icons include:
22 new person icons
26 new house icons
24 new building icons, including a renamed building to buildings
22 new database icons
24 new street sign icons
New globe icons
New EV, taxi, bus, and scooter transportation icons
New rockets
and more!
We also fixed the fill rules for several  some issues across the docs, including:
De-duped category names Brand and Brands to be just Brand
Updated tags on several icon pages for additional aliases
Looking for more new icons? Head to the issue tracker to check for open requests or submit a new one.
Install
To get started, install or update via npm:
npm i bootstrap-icons


Or Composer:
composer require twbs/bootstrap-icons


You can also download the release from GitHub, or download just the SVGs and fonts (without the rest of the repository files).
Figma
The Figma file is now published to the Figma Community! It’s the same Bootstrap Icons Figma file you’ve seen from previous releases, just a little more accessible to those using the app.</p>

          <p>Testing takes time. And testing done well can take a lot of time. Similar to
someone learning to cook a new recipe, picking up a new hobby, or just studying
for their next exam, success often comes down to rigorous testing and
preparation.
This is why we&#x27;re taking a deliberate approach to testing the Privacy Sandbox
for the Web. We began by researching user preferences and trends, legal
requirements, and ecosystem dependencies. We also met with industry participants
to understand their use cases and with regulators to hear their perspectives.
This year, we made Privacy Sandbox technologies available for functional testing
to make sure the web technologies for Privacy Sandbox are technically sound and
that the core designs are ready for expanded testing. We&#x27;ve done this while

Post-conference Thoughts #
One post-JamstackConf thought I wish I had communicated better on the frameworks panel:
The web will be better served by a broader plurality of successful frameworks: Lit, Qwik, Solid, Astro, Svelte, Marko, Eleventy, and the one y’all are dreaming up now!
The post-React world is here, it just needs your help to be evenly distributed 🏆

and the same on a Tweet from @thenewstack
A tweet from @patak_dev: “The @jamstackconf’s OSS Is Out to End the Frameworks Wars panel was heart-warming. As @biilmann said, it was great to set the right tone. The Web is better if we collaborate, exchange ideas, and explore different tradeoffs. Look at that smiles!”

          <p>Hi, I’m the technical founder of OneGen. I&#x27;ve been a software engineer for over a decade, but it wasn&#x27;t until the pandemic that I decided to take a leap of faith and build an innovative solution to designing data models.
Most applications &amp; SDKs support more than one platform. And for each platform, software engineers write and maintain the same (or similar) data models.
I thought that if I could design data models completely independent of a database or a programming language in a way that allows versioning and collaboration and then generate the model code for whatever the technology stack is, it would be pretty cool.
OneGen doesn&#x27;t work as a one-time code generator. Instead, you design and continuously maintain your data models right inside the app to achieve a single source of truth.
We&#x27;re excited to announce our free beta release to you.

          <p>Hi folks, I&#x27;ve been working on a visual devtool chrome extension for Tailwind CSS for quite some time now and just launched in recently.
It let&#x27;s you tweak your website from the browser itself   and copy the classes or html afterwards to paste in your IDE. It&#x27;s especially well suited to try out changes quickly, but I&#x27;ve built most of the landing page with the help of the extension itself.
You can try it out in the landing page itself (no need to install anything).
Features:
- Click on any class (eg: px-4) and try out other values easily.
-  Preview the website in responsive mode and quickly toggle between breakpoints. auto detects breakpoints set in the config.
- Quickly try out new variants. Supports arbitrary variants too.
- Lets you try out arbitrary and negative property values.
- Add, remove or re-order elements.
- Edit element attributes and text nodes
etc.
I&#x27;m excited to share it here and would love to hear your feedback and suggestions.

          <p>https://opencollective.com/emmet
I thought this was peculiar for two reasons:
* While we all know and love Emmet, I am surprised it&#x27;s still getting money to this day. Its website is stuck firmly in the Web 2.0 era.
* Most of its sponsors are casinos and other gambling websites, and in the real world it&#x27;s usually an indicator of possible money laundering.
* All donations are exactly $150, every time.
Anyone know what&#x27;s going on here? Seems like to me someone is laundering money through OpenCollective...

Are there any less intense ways to follow the links that pop up here, whatever &#x27;less intense&#x27; might mean to you? Maybe just posts that hit the top 10, maybe only posts that linger on the front page for a certain amount of time.

I get it that not everything can be converted, but just to manage to get the images and text out and formated right it would be great.
My second option is to copy HTML source code, but I don&#x27;t think that GitHub pages support all of the HTML tags.

          <p>MakePlace is a PC app that lets you drag-and-drop furniture and edit floorplans. The goal is to make interior design easy and fun, like playing with Lego.
It started off as an app to simulate housing in an MMORPG, since the furniture system there was atrocious. I&#x27;m now trying to adapt it as a simulator for general interior design.
Like many 3D design software, there are a bunch of tools and controls, and first-time users may feel somewhat lost. So I&#x27;ve made a starting tutorial to help ease users into the controls. Do you think the tutorial works well?
Let me know what else can be improved!

          <p>I have a rails app and I need to build a good UI for my website. It has a form and requires CRUD operations and has 3/4 pages. The backend is in place, but I&#x27;m not quite comfortable with the UI part. I need to build a UI that is responsive. Are there any recommended drap/drop UI builders that can export the required HTML/CSS that I can just shove into my existing rails app?
Sites like wordpress will allow me to create a UI and some backend but it is a new backend that I&#x27;ll need to learn. I&#x27;d rather keep the backend as rails as I&#x27;m comfortable with it, so it&#x27;ll be faster for me to build on it.

          <p>I would like to move away from CMS that I&#x27;m using to GitHub pages. I think that the easiest way is to use my RSS feed as source, but I don&#x27;t know how to convert. I get it that not everything can be converted, but just to manage to get the images and text out and formated right it would be great.
My second option is to copy HTML source code, but I don&#x27;t think that GitHub pages support all of the HTML tags.

          <p>Hey,
when I started this newsletter in 2013, I’d never imagined to writing this for nine years, to have thousands of subscribers via email, and many more via the website, social media, and the RSS feed. With many ups and downs, changes in schedule, and ups and downs in motivation, I’m glad to have this project still alive, to get feedback from my dear readers (you), and seem to have a positive impact on web developers’ work lives. This is what still motivates me today.
But what remains open is the question of monetarizing this project. I have always accepted contributions, but they decline every year. And while the monthly schedule brings a bit more flexibility, writing the newsletter is the big chunk of work. Right now, I’m happy if the contributions at least pay my hosting and sending bi…</p>

          <p>The Storage Standard defines an API for persistent storage and
quota estimates, and the platform storage architecture. It&#x27;s available behind the
#enable-experimental-web-platform-features flag in Chromium 106, and we&#x27;d love your feedback.
# What problem does the storage standard aim to solve?
Traditionally, as the user runs out of storage space on their device, the data stored with APIs like
IndexedDB or localStorage gets lost without the user being able to intervene. A way to make
storage persistent is through invoking the
persist() method of the
StorageManager interface. It simultaneously requests the end user for permission and changes the
storage to be persistent once granted:
const persisted &#x3D; await navigator.storage.persist();

          <p>I recently built a tool to manage and store RSS Feeds in Notion. 
The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t auto save the HTML into notion page (this would required parsing HTML into Notion objects). I started on this with [html2notion](https://github.com/Jeadie/html2notion), but it turned out to be alot of work.
With Notion already having a [Notion web clipper](https://www.notion.so/web-clipper), I was wondering if it was worth implementing? Personally I read a small fraction of the blog posts from my RSS feed, and I like the spare page to take notes. For me, notion-rss solves the one core problem I have, acquiring and filtering high quality RSS feeds. What does HN think?

          <p>So much talk about Twitter alternatives in recent days, including people migrating to Mastodon and even Jack Dorsey announcing his new decentralized social media platform.
I was thinking, if I was to build a new micro-blogging aka Twitter alternative, what technological choices would I make to get it quickly off the ground but allow for scale?
What database technology or approach would you go for?
Would you build a (mobile first) web application first or would you start straight away with a native iOS/Android app (maybe Flutter)?
Would you go for a centralised or decentralized approach? If the latter, how would you decentralize it without sacrificing the &quot;public town square&quot; effect that Twitter currently has but is clearly lacking with the fragmentation of Mastodon?
To answer my own question, I would probably build a centralized platform like Twitter is now, probably opt for a fast NoSQL database like Google&#x27;s Firestore in Datastore mode and to keep things simple I would probably even make sure that tweets would get automatically deleted after some years as I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s needed to build a forever growing database of people&#x27;s thoughts in that moment that persists for decades to come. Micro-blogging always felt to me as a thing right now, a thought in this moment but that thought could be different in a few days, months and definitely a few years, so why store it forever. Feels like I could save a huge operational cost and prevent abuse by not keeping tweets for beyond their relevancy.
What are your thoughts?

For a long time now, we’ve been working behind the scenes to deliver one of the most widely-requested features from the WebPageTest community.

          <p>On the Chrome team, we are constantly amazed by the pace of innovation on the web. Since the launch of the Chrome Web Store (CWS), our goal has been to enable the creation of innovative and useful products, and we couldn&#x27;t do this without a rich community of developers. As the variety of products offered on CWS has evolved over the years, we&#x27;ve received some important feedback regarding how our policies are written and enforced. We agree that we can do better to make our policies clearer to developers and to enforce them in a way that does not come at the expense of good-intentioned developers who provide useful products.
To that end, we&#x27;ve decided to provide more context on our policies and our general philosophy for the evolution of the Chrome Web Store. Through this update, we hope to b…</p>

          <p>I have a dream of making a cringe detector - a program that you could input a tweet or image, and it outputs how cringy it is.
I am thinking, it could use a neural net, or not necessary.
I was trying to imagine, how could that thing work? And actually out of clue.
What do you think?

Not just text but fully interactive web-pages that load images and videos.
I&#x27;m fairly certain there will always be some sort of compatibility mode, but for a general audience, I&#x27;m wondering if in 30 years, browsers (or their equivalent) would have moved to something closer to a canvas rendering model or something that makes accessing this data difficult.

          <p>cssminc is a CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) minifier implemented as a tiny, dependency-free, C89-compliant library which can read CSS from arbitrary sources (via a callback) and emit it in minified form to an arbitrary destination (via a callback).
Its library-level code is only 2 files (one header, one implementation) and it includes an optional CLI app which demonstrates how it&#x27;s used.

Each had their benefits, but ultimately all these years later I still believe that the ability to extend native prototypes is a […]

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;33390423 target="_blank">Ask HN: Books covering best practices in advanced multithreaded design in C++</a>
          <p>I&#x27;m looking for books or online resources showing best practices in use of atomics, barriers and locks in the design of multithreaded realtime applications in C++. I am specifically looking for actual implementation examples and architecture examples and not just covering the basic theory or use.
Background/context:
I am working on an application where I need to share various datastructures between threads. I&#x27;ve been using atomics but as the complexity grows it becomes hard to review code for &quot;correctness&quot;. My goal is to avoid holding locks for long periods of time. Since this is a realtime application I also want to avoid waiting. So lock-free, wait-free is preferred.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;33394730 target="_blank">Ask HN: Is speed of delivery the most important metric in productivity?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;m fairly new to the field and relatively late to the party (because I&#x27;m old), but a recurring theme that I&#x27;m noticing in my current company (which is a small startup) is how the faster you deliver the better you look to the CEO and even CTO&#x27;s eyes.
In hour fairly infrequent meetings other engineers have raised the point that we should start valuing code quality and proper testing to our codebase, only to be met with arguments such as &quot;the customer doesn&#x27;t pay for good code&quot;.
Furthermore, most likely an anecdotal bias and nothing else but I want to mention it: Online elitism revolves around shipping speed too. Comments like &quot;I can build X in Y hours&quot;, &quot;I can skim the docs and build what I want with Z library in less than a day&quot;, and so on.
How does everyone feel about it? Maybe it&#x27;s just me but it feels weird. It&#x27;s kinda like everyone I mentioned feels like there are no trade-offs to be concerned in regards to speed over quality or people decided that there&#x27;s no reason to bother ourselves with contemplating what we&#x27;re trading off speed with. Also, I feel that because quality is subjective and perfect is the enemy of done, people rely on objective metrics like &quot;time taken&quot;.
Is there truth and merit to this observation?

          <p>I’ve spent the last week or so cleaning, purging, and reorganizing my office. I had encapsulated myself in a micro-hoarder situation in the shed which made it difficult to get focused. Clutter, as I’m learning, is adversarial to my distractible brain. One task that’s been looming over my head was this box of file folders.
This box of file folders was a collection of all expenses and tax documents from the years 2012-2016. And I mean everything. Every gas, electric, internet, and credit card bill that came to my house. Every business expense. Every health expense. Every mortgage payment. The reason I hoarded all these documents? Self-employment. All those numbers factor into my tax bill every year, so I kept every physical document that was relevant. America glamorizes starting your own bus…</p>

          <p>If you like me have many events during the day, you are probably also tired by constant switching to Mac Calendar or Google Calendar just to check when the next event starts. I searched for a widget that would show me upcoming events in some &quot;always visible&quot; way, but all apps showed the schedule in a separate window. So I decided to make a new app that would show a schedule right in a Dock icon.
More to this, My Upcoming Events shows a countdown in the same Dock icon several minutes before the start of the event, which is handy for me, so I can start right on time.
Limitations: MacOS, Google Calendar only.

          <p>The only two possible filters on the list of videos of a channel now are most recent and most popular.
I know it&#x27;s a small thing but somehow this hits me really hard.
Also, there&#x27;s less videos on a single row now. Because we can&#x27;t read more than that without our attention span going poof.

          <p>I’ve been working on a little site to replace Nuzzle after Twitter acquired and shut it down last year. The basic idea is that you connect your Twitter account and receive a unique RSS feed that gives you all the links that would show up in your Twitter timeline. I mostly built it for myself but given all the Twitter drama, I figure there are people out there like me who want to escape the commentary, but still value the links people share.
Please give it a try! If you encounter bugs or want to give feedback, you can drop a comment here or message me on Twitter at @kdamica.

          <p>In November, with the release of Chrome 108, Chrome will make some changes to how the Layout Viewport behaves when the on-screen keyboard (OSK) gets shown. With this change, Chrome on Android will no longer resize the Layout Viewport, and instead resize only the Visual Viewport. This will bring Chrome on Android’s behavior up to par with that of Chrome on iOS and Safari on iOS.
Here&#x27;s some background on what&#x27;s happening, why Chrome is making this change, and what you can do to prepare.
# The Layout Viewport and the Visual Viewport
When visiting a website, you don’t get to see the entire page&#x27;s contents after it has loaded. Instead, the browser offers you a viewport through which you get to see a portion of the page. This viewport is also known as the Layout Viewport. When the content of a …</p>

Learn more about the features listed here through the provided links or from the list on ChromeStatus.com. Chrome 108 is beta as of October 27, 2022. You can download the latest on Google.com for desktop or on Google Play Store on Android.
# CSS
Chrome 108 includes a number of new CSS features.
# CSS Overflow for replaced elements
Chrome will start to roll out a change that allows developers to use the existing overflow property with replaced elements that paint outside the content-box. Paired with object-view-box this can be used to create an image with a custom glow or shadow applied, with proper ink-overflow behavior like a CSS shadow would ha…</p>

          <p>The Payment Handler API
allows payment providers to make their custom payment experience available for
merchants, along with the Payment Request
API. When the Payment Request
API is initialized via the
new PaymentRequest() constructor, it silently fires a canmakepayment event with
the merchant&#x27;s origin and arbitrary data to
a service worker that is registered for the Payment Handler API.
This cross-origin communication does not require a user gesture and does not
show any user interface.
Chrome is going to remove the identifying fields from canmakepayment event
and start the origin trial from Chrome 108.
The information on this page only applies to the payment app providers that use
the Payment Handler API. If you don&#x27;t use it, you can skip these instructions.

          <p>In the course of my work I sometimes find myself needing to mock API requests — often when I’m prototyping, or testing a concept for an article. There are a couple of useful (free) tools I reach for on these occasions.
n:point
n:point provides lightweight, publicly accessible API endpoints for your JSON data. It’s super easy to use: simply give it some JSON and it sets up an endpoint in seconds. No messing about with access tokens, it’s ideal if you just want to fetch some data. You can also define and lock the JSON schema. I’m using n:point for a Codrops article on creating an interactive line graph based on timeseries data.
Mockeroo
If you need to actually generate some data, Mockeroo is a tool that enables you to do just that. You can add rows of different types and Mockeroo will generate random data. There are configuration options, including setting ranges (for numbers and dates, for example), and including null values. If you’re happy writing Ruby, you can also include formulas and you can download the data in different formats.
I’ve only used Mockeroo for generating JSON, but you can also create API endpoints. It’s not as quick as n:point to set up, but looks useful if you need to mock any more complex API requests.</p>

          <p>The
origin private file system
provides access to a special kind of file that is highly optimized for performance, for example, by
offering in-place and exclusive write access to a file&#x27;s content. Developers can get access to such
files by calling
createSyncAccessHandle(),
which is a method exposed on
FileSystemFileHandle objects. This call
results in a FileSystemSyncAccessHandle.
The createSyncAccessHandle() method and therefore FileSystemSyncAccessHandle is only
exposed in Workers. It is not available in the main thread. 


FileSystemSyncAccessHandle is a file primitive that provides performant access to local files. One
of its main use cases is applications porting C/C++ code to Wasm; however, asynchronous calls are
not fully supported on Wasm yet, and using the

          <p>I have a regrettable habit of folding my legs on the chair when working and hunch back, which is unhealthy.
Anyone who had struggled with something similar in the past, please share your advice and experience.
BTW, I also have ADHD which comes with challenge of behavior inhibition.

          <p>This week, no sooner than October 26, we will begin increasing the Privacy
Sandbox Relevance and Measurement origin trial population towards 5% of Chrome
Stable users. We always take an incremental approach to increasing limits and
actively monitor for issues in Chrome origin trials–you can expect to see
traffic levels increase over a period of a few days. Pre-stable channels, Canary
and Beta will continue as is with a 50/50 split for origin trial eligibility.
We brought the trial to Chrome Stable in
August to enable functional testing
in a real, production environment—and the results helped us improve API
stability, developer documentation, and support. We are increasing the scale of
this testing to 5% to continue functional testing through 2022 and prepare for
utility testing in 2023.

We are on the path towards phasing out third-party cookies across the web

On the surface, cookies provide a simple key-value store that&#x27;s sent between the
browser and the server. That can provide useful functionality on a site such as
saving a preference: theme&#x3D;bats or storing the session ID for a signed in
user.
If that cookie is being used on the same site that set it, then we tend to call
that a first-party cookie. If it&#x27;s being used as part of a different site than

          <p>Hi HN,
I am trying to find an article I read, possibly posted on HN, about how mobile operating systems are becoming/could become the de facto unified messaging interface across multiple instant messaging apps due to the ubiquity of push notifications and the prevalence of contacts on share sheets.
As I recall, it was primary a UI/UX-focused article.
Unfortunately after an hour of trying various search combinations I have not come up with anything. I&#x27;m pretty sure it was an article published after 2019.
Hopefully someone remembers this and can share the link with me in the comments.

Despite her potency, the “dysfunctional ship had a sullen crew that resented being there and could not wait to get out of the Navy.” By the time he left, less …

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;33294641 target="_blank">Ask HN: Help finding good embedded DSP design resources?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;m working on an LED art project that combines a few realtime signals; audio and some other inputs to inform the visuals. I&#x27;m running things on an ESP32 right now and doing an FFT and some other sort of seat-of-the-pants DSP stuff on one core while the other handles bluetooth, LED control, etc. I&#x27;ve got some time to mess around and I&#x27;d like to get a broad strokes overview of the embedded DSP field to inform myself on where to explore next. I&#x27;ve got a fair bit of hands on experience but little formal training.
Ultimately the goal is to *make good art* so I&#x27;m not really looking for anything specific. In my head I&#x27;ll get some good papers/textbooks/libraries/articles recommended to me and then I&#x27;ll spend a few weeks to write toy implementations of whatever seems interesting in C to get a feel for the space.
I&#x27;m particularly looking for the nitty-gritty type stuff, cool hacks that save cycles and improve latency, my goal here is visceral reactivity and I&#x27;d like to get some more tools in my toolkit that allow me to interpret and combine signals in realtime in interesting ways. Even info on cool math hacks like Carmack&#x27;s fast inverse square root would be appreciated.
P.S. Also of interest is material on debugging and modelling realtime code.

          <p>This is my background image.
I set:
    background-position:50% 50%;
I get this as my output:
But I don’t understand the output.
So, I read little bit about background-position again.
&gt;A value such as 20% 65% specifies that the point 20% across and 65% down the image be placed at the point 20% across and 65% down the element.
https://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/css/color-background/background-position.html
&gt;With a value pair of &#x27;14% 84%&#x27;, the point 14% across and 84% down the image is to be placed at the point 14% across and 84% down the padding area.
https://wiki.cdot.senecacollege.ca/wiki/CSS_GUIDE_BACKGROUND_POSITION
&gt;A horizontal value of 25% positions the point 25% from the left edge of the image at a point that is 25% from the left edge of the background positioning area.
“Learning web design” by Jenniver Nierdest Robbins
If I wanted to put the background image at the center using the “percentage percentage”, how’d I do it? (50% 0% doesn’t work).
Sadly, I still don’t get it.
My HTML Code:
    
    
Document
        

My CSS code:
    body{
        background-color:yellowgreen;
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        background-image: url(../images/circle.png);
        background-position:50% 0%;
       
    }

          <p>I recently started using AWS for my new job, and am currently stuck with CloudWatch for logs. I used to dislike Graylog because of the clunky interface, but I just cannot extract anything from CloudWatch! My logs are there, I can view them but it&#x27;s impossible to query them:
- on the Log Streams page, the pagination doesn&#x27;t work, I can only view page 1
- if I do &quot;Search all streams&quot; with a basic filter (something like &#x60;foo &#x3D; &quot;bar&quot;&#x60;) it doesn&#x27;t return anything (I know there are some matches I can see them)
- Logs Insights is limited to the last 3 hours of logs
Is there an alternative CloudWatch interface somewhere that would allow me to finally query my logs? I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s a CLI, a heavy client or a webpage, I just want to query my logs...

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;33275657 target="_blank">What&#x27;s the difference between CSS “em” and “rem”?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;ve read this much about this:
1) Learning Web Design
Book by Jennifer Niederst Robbins
1 rem&#x3D; 1* browser&#x27;s default font size
1 em&#x3D; depends on the element type, for h1 it&#x27;s something, for h2, it&#x27;s sth else.
2) https://css-tricks.com/confused-rem-em/
&gt;While em is relative to the font-size of its direct or nearest parent, rem is only relative to the html (root) font-size.
I get the rem part, but not the em part. What does it mean?
3) https://blog.logrocket.com/using-em-vs-rem-css/#:~:text&#x3D;Let%27s%20get%20started!-,What%20are%20em%20and%20rem%20and%20why%20use%20them%3F,relative%20to%20a%20set%20value.
I&#x27;ve read this as well but since I&#x27;m only knowing html and starting to learn css, I could not get most of the things written there.
4) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;tlRLEsZa89M
I watch this short video. It does makes things somewhat clear about &quot;inherits from parent&quot;.
Anyway, I am eager to learn the crux of &quot;em&quot;. Maybe with some code examples, or figures(if it&#x27;s lying anywhere in internet)

          <p>It’s been some years since Tab Atkins-Bittner first proposed Cascading Attribute Sheets. I had a situation come up which made me think about them again and I thought I’d share.
On my site I have a handful of blog posts which have a title and/or text content in different languages. As someone who speaks a handful of languages, I like incorporating different languages, phrases, and untranslatable words into my day-to-day blogging. 「手答え」(tegotae) is an example of one of those words. It directly translates to “hand response” but is sometimes translated as “haptic feedback” or “game feel” when used in a video game context.
One problem with my use of other languages is that I’m lacking proper lang attributes on the foreign text, which makes it inaccessible. I’ve started brainstorming ways out of…</p>
