          <p>April was a busy month of new happenings and finishing projects. I did a new workshop, we got a new lawn, my kids are learning new skills, my wife got a new (short term) job, new developments at my new company, a new blog design, and to cap it all off I turned a new age number which is for sure what people call having a birthday.

My wife and I have wanted to redo the yard for awhile now. In Austin it’s hard to find people to do the work.

We asked José, not expecting to hear back, and he said he could start that week.

          <p>These days, almost every company is a design company, but the need for qualified designers far exceeds the supply. To fill this gap, companies of all sizes are embracing no-design tools that let non-designers participate in the design process.

          <p>As I’ve written about recently, it’s super exciting to see a bunch of new CSS features landing in browsers, and who can blame us for wanting to get started using them straight away?! It’s great to see browsers working to support new CSS features quicker than ever before, and that pace should persist with Interop, an initiative where browser vendors work together to implement features interoperably. And with so-called “evergreen” browsers, most users should see those new features right away, as their browsers update seamlessly.
But, as Jim Neilsen pointed out, that doesn’t mean every user has the latest and greatest browser version. Many older devices can’t update to the latest version. The OS doesn’t support it. This means that:
You need to test your website on older devices, and

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/inert/ target="_blank">Introducing inert</a>
          <p>The inert property is a global HTML attribute that simplifies how to remove and restore user input events for an element, including focus events and events from assistive technologies.
Inert is a default behavior in dialog elements, such as when you use showModal to open a dialog for users to make a selection and then dismiss it from the screen. In new browser versions, the inert attribute is available to bring similar accessible experiences to custom UI elements and interactions more granularly.
In Chromium 102, inert is available by default for developers.
Inert means lacking the ability to move, so when you mark something inert, you remove movement or interaction from those DOM elements.

          <p>Collapsing content sections, sometimes described as an accordion, are a common UI pattern. However, content hidden in the collapsed sections becomes impossible to search using a find-in-page search. Also, it isn&#x27;t possible to link to text fragments inside collapsed regions.
The hidden&#x3D;until-found HTML attribute and beforematch event can solve these problems. By adding hidden&#x3D;until-found to the container for your hidden content, you make it possible for the browser to search text in that hidden region, and reveal the section if a match is found.
In addition to allowing find-in-page search on hidden regions, this feature will allow this hidden content to be accessible to search engines. Google Search will even form links that scroll to the revealed fragment.
These features are available from…</p>

          <p>If you’re a freelance designer or creative entrepreneur, you may have heard the word “cybersecurity” buzzing around a lot lately—especially in the last two years as more businesses lean into the digital world and online tools. But with new changes come new opportunities, both for businesses and cybercriminals.
Let’s dive into what cybersecurity really means and how you can use it to protect your business — whether you’re a freelance designer or a growing creative agency.

          <p>I got some landscaping done this month and as a reward the YouTube algorithm brought me a new genre of video called “Tall Grass”. These are the lawns with shoulder high grass, filled with mice and snakes, endlessly consuming buildings, fences, and concrete. It’s complete and utter ASMR for me.

My favorite among them is Al Bladez. Al and his best friend AJ take one day a week and offer to mow someone-in-need’s yard for free. To be clear, there’s an economy here, the homeowner gets their yard mowed and Al gets a YouTube video out of the deal which garners a million views. But the homeowners — and more often than not, the neighbors — are incredibly thankful to see the transformations.
The circumstances differ from yard to yard. Sometimes the homeowner is elderly, ailing, deceased, or in the hospital; unable or unfit to mow their lawn. In those situations Al’s work is a simple act of charity.
Sometimes, the homeowner is perfectly able but hasn’t mowed their lawn. What I love about Al is that he doesn’t show an ounce of judgement. Al doesn’t care if you’ve been in jail, or if you’re too poor, your mower broke, you’re unemployed, you’re struggling with addiction, or you’re just plain lazy. He’s there to cut grass — tall grass — and bring a bit of pride back to his community and hopefully help people dodge citations from the city.
To top it off, Al’s personal slogan is “Impact Over Views” and whew, that’s a lot to think about. I love that outlook and wish I could embody it more.
Whatever religion Al is peddling, I want to be a part of it.</p>

          <p>What seems like only a few months ago, I wrote about being diagnosed with MS, and yet that was over 2 years ago (and the diagnosis was actually December 2019).
As it&#x27;s MS Awareness Week 2022 and MS was on my mind (literally and figuratively!) I thought an update blog post would seem fit.
My post in 2020 started stating this, which, as it turns out, wasn&#x27;t right at all:

I was diagnosed with &quot;very mild benign relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis&quot;.</p>

          <p>Howdy! If you frequent this website often, you’ll notice some changes. This weekend I started on my planned redesign, but as I started nudging my About section, I found myself in a fight with my typography. After some hemming and hawing, I made the drastic decision to nuke my stylesheets and start over.
~81 file changes later, I made another decision to yeet my changes live and do an open redesign. Not my original plan, but it’ll be good blog fodder. One thing I want to avoid is killing blogging momentum by getting sunk in a redesign branch.
Without further ado, as with any redesign, let’s see what we’re dealing with first…

          <p>The Capabilities Project (code name Project Fugu) is a cross-company effort with
the objective of making it possible for web apps to do anything platform-specific apps can. We
enable amazing web applications like Photoshop by exposing the capabilities of
the underlying operating system platforms to the web platform, while maintaining user security,
privacy, trust, and other core tenets of the web.
But what are examples of some of the apps that make use of these capabilities? The Project Fugu API
Showcase embedded below is sourced by community submissions and contains a filterable list of apps
that make use of one or more APIs that were developed in the context of the project. You can propose
missing apps by submitting them via an
anonymous form.
Submissions are reviewed on a regular basis and the showcase will be updated accordingly.
You can launch each app by clicking the app&#x27;s name, the app&#x27;s preview image, or the Launch app
link. For many apps, you can also see the source code by clicking Source code. On supporting
browsers, you can share any of the listed apps via the Share app feature. As a special inception
Easter egg, the Project Fugu API Showcase is of course
contained
in the Project Fugu API Showcase. Happy browsing!</p>

          <p>Over the last decade, identity federation has played a central role in
raising the bar for authentication on the web, in terms of ease-of-use (such
as password-less single sign-in), security (such as improved resistance to
phishing and credential stuffing attacks) and trustworthiness compared to
per-site usernames and passwords. With identity federation, a RP (relying
party) relies on an IDP (identity provider) to provide the user an account
without requiring a new username and password.

Key Term
Identity federation delegates authentication or authorization of an
individual (user or entity) to a trusted external party (an identity
provider or IdP). The identity provider then allows the individual to sign in
to a website (a relying party or RP).
Unfortunately, the mechanisms that identity …</p>

          <p>In February, I got nerd-sniped by a mention on Twitter about a productivity system called PARA. PARA is a way to organize your digital life in to separate buckets: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives.

After watching some videos, I started applying PARA to my second brain in Notion. The timing to choose to redo my entire Notion setup was horrible, of course. I was busy with work, writing a workshop, moving ShopTalk to its own YouTube channel… why not pick up another big project and redo my entire organization system?

          <p>I came across a website that had HN users seeing if they could complete a registration process. People posted their times (13 minutes, 30 mins etc) in the comments. I can&#x27;t seem to find it.
Does anyone remember what this was? Or have examples of websites that are similar?

          <p>Providing visibility into your work is one of the most underrated developer soft skills. Coworkers are often too busy to keep track of what’s going on with engineering work, even if it’s their job to know what’s going on with engineering work. It’s generally not out of malice or lack of interest, but a lack of time and energy to chase down every issue or conversation thread. And to be fair, engineering is an opaque process where we trick the rocks inside a computer to act like a business.
Standups are a great tool for sharing visibility. Unfortunately, not everyone loves standups. I’ve personally experienced some extremely toxic scrum master situations. Impersonal bots can have the same effect. A daily status report can feel like micromangement leading to a loss of autonomy. Also, that vis…</p>

          <p>Signed exchanges (SXGs) are a means to improve your page speed—mainly Largest Contentful Paint (LCP). When referring sites (currently Google Search) link to a page, they can prefetch it into the browser cache before the user clicks on the link.
It&#x27;s possible to make web pages that, when prefetched, require no network on the critical path to rendering the page! On a 4G connection, this page load goes from 6s to 0.9s (the remaining 0.9s being mostly by CPU usage):
          

Most people publishing SXGs today are using Cloudflare&#x27;s easy-to-use Automatic Signed Exchanges (ASX) feature (though open source options exist too):
In many cases, checking the box to enable this feature is enough to get the kind of substantial improvement shown above. Sometimes, there are a few more steps to ensure th…</p>

          <p>There exists a lot of high-quality UI component libraries such as MUI, Bootstrap, ANT, Grommet, Chakra, Semantic UI, etc. These components typically map to primitive types:
    boolean -&gt; checkbox / toggle button / visibility
    integer -&gt; numeric input / slider
    enum -&gt; drop down menu / radio buttons
    string -&gt; text field
    date -&gt; date picker

Have I been searching in the wrong place or do such higher-level UI component libraries actually don&#x27;t exist?

          <p>The surprisingly rapid pace of innovation in the blockchain space has become quite obvious to even the staunchest of crypto critics. The successful deployment of Ethereum scalability solutions, such as Polygon, has substantially accelerated the adoption curve for blockchain and Web3 apps. Gaming, FinTech, digital identity, social media and publishing will very likely become Web3-enabled within the next 5 to 10 years. DeFi(decentralized finance) apps and platforms are already there, offering a solution to several problems in traditional finance.
There&#x27;s an ever-increasing demand for experienced UI/UX designers among forward-looking Web3 startups. 
But for a new technology to succeed and achieve mass adoption, it doesn’t only need to improve upon the existing status quo — it also has to avoi…</p>

          <p>I use Thunderbird. I have configured it so that it shows me the text part of the emails I get.
Unfortunately, every now and then the text part is so broken that I would like to render the HTML part.
But it seems like Thunderbird does not offer a way to do this for a single email.
Looking at the source code of such an email, there is no plain HTML but some gibberish with &quot;Content-Type: multipart/alternative;&quot; or &quot;Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable&quot;.
Any ideas how to go about this?

          <p>Developers often tell us that it’s difficult to keep up with changes on the web and understand why these changes are happening. Today, we’re kicking off a new series called Chrome Dev Insider where we’ll share (1) What’s cool and newsworthy, (2) An insight into how we made a decision on a key topic (for example changing FLOC) or approach our work with the ecosystem (for example Interop 2022), and (3) any really important things that you need to know about (for example changes in user agent strings).
As we share what we are working on, it will be in the context of our four priorities for 2022:
Enabling delightful user experiences: make things intuitive for users; whether it’s performance, transactions, identity or transitions.

          <p>Embedded content is the best way to keep users on your site, while sharing
content from other pages or sites. This could be as small as an embedded Tweet,
which displays in Twitter&#x27;s style and format. It could be as large as an
entirely separate site embedded onto your own, such as an embedded Shopify shop
where visitors can make a purchase without leaving your site.
Now more than ever, it&#x27;s important that our sites remain secure when we embed
content.
There are several ways developers can embed content on a website. The most
common technique is to use an

which allows you to embed any content onto your site with just a URL. It&#x27;s
already possible to add the sandbox attribute to make an iframe more secure.
Alternatively, you could use a proposed HTML element:

          <p>We’ve all seen websites or digital experiences that we immediately thought of as “bad designs.” But what actually makes a design “bad”? And how do we, as designers, learn to recognize and avoid those mistakes?
Understanding what makes a design bad is the first step in learning how to create good designs. Here are ten common examples of bad design and how to correct their shortcomings.
1. The design is too cluttered
Cluttered designs were commonly seen in the early days of the internet. Designers tried to cram as much as they could onto each page, often ignoring white space entirely. The results were pages that were hard to navigate, lacked structure, and made finding what you were looking for almost impossible.
While the cluttered UIs of 90s design and early 00s have (mostly) disappeared, …</p>

For example, download this JSON file. You can import it with the import button and replay the user flow.
          
Apart from that, you can export the recording as well. After recording a user flow, click on the export button. There are 3 export options:

          <p>Im currently exploring the design of an account and role based permissions system.
Im trying to look for and find standard patterns (if any) for structuring user accounts, organisations, sub organisations and products.
It would need to handle:
1. Role based permissions
2. Roll up billing
My initial thoughts are:
1. A user account is unique but can be a member of 1 or more organisations.
2. An organisation could have one or more sub organisations. 
3. An organisation (or sub organisation) would be subscribed to one or more products
4. A the product level, the user would have role based permissions to provide access to certain features.
How would you best design something like this from a rule / hierarchy perspective?
Would you apply role based permissions at every level for the user?

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;30984469 target="_blank">Ask HN: How awful material design is?</a>
          <p>Hello, i am a part time/student worker as Frontend Developer. Apple products are my personal devices and habe a windows laptop from the company i work for.
I saw obviously material design on my sites. But for the first time a task given me to remove Bootstrat from a project and use Vuetify (Matrial Design flavored) instead.
My experience is more than awful. Who think that the bounce effect on click can be a good thing? Why button texts have to be uppercase? Is the border at bottom really means something?
I can’t really engage with this design system and i can’t really understand why is this thing so popular. Am i alone?

          <p>Is there a hobbyist forum or some kind of online resource where users showcase their custom Linux UI designs?
Specifically their wallpaper and desktop layout - with all their usual windows open at the ready.
Alternatively if any of you are happy to share screenshots of your custom UI designs I would love to see them!

          <p>I sometimes spot colleagues making design decisions that seem really bad to me. A common pattern is building something that already exists in much better form as open source software. I usually try to get them to realize the error themselves by asking questions like &quot;how does this compare to open source library X&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t always work. How do you deal with things like this, keeping in mind that I&#x27;m not all knowing and could be wrong but also feel a responsibility to protect the larger organization from bad tech.

          <p>Hey all, I&#x27;m looking to level-up my API design game and thought a solid book on the topic could be great, but I&#x27;m having a hard time picking out signal from noise in the sea of publications. Especially considering some recommendations out there are a decade+ old, when things have changed significantly in certain areas (like browser tech) since then.
Primarily thinking about web APIs (meaning REST these days) but anything goes. Guiding principles &gt;&gt; &quot;how to build an API in framework Foo&quot;!
Have you got any suggestions? Thanks!

          <p>Hi HN!
While working on a project that requires some images of keyboard shortcuts to be put in documentation, I came up with the idea of this small design tool.
kcaps.app is quite simple, however, it provides a number of color schemes and allows users to quickly print or press keyboard combinations and download images as a result.
I hope it will be helpful for someone else :)

          <p>Hey,
if you read this email, it’ll be technically different from the previous. When I recently updated my newsletter service server software nearly everything broke into pieces. I was using mailtrain v1 for a long time now but it’s deprecated and using old node versions. Upgrading to v2 wasn’t easy enough for me and I also wanted to have an easier to maintain mailer anyway. The new email is sent via Spatie’s Laravel Mailcoach. So far it’s a pretty manual process again since it doesn’t support RSS-campaigns. At some point in future I want to publish the newsletter via Kirby to the Mailcoach API.
But at this point I now changed my template as well to a modern MJML based template code. This should hopefully fix all the rendering issues you reported to me recently. I tried to support light and…</p>

          <p>It can be super fun to work with teams on unique and exciting products, but the real success of virtually any product begins and ends with the user. It’s as simple as this: no users, no product.
This begs the question, how can you create great products for your users?
When you incorporate great UX design principles into your product, your users will have a better experience. Great UX starts with great user research.
Excellent user research can help your team with scheduling and technical feasibility. It can also provide much-needed insights into your users with cross-functional applications (think of your marketing department).
Discover how to cater your products to your ideal users’ wants, needs, and challenges by conducting effective user research.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;30928671 target="_blank">Ask HN: How does Apple do UX research?</a>
          <p>It seems that the tech community accepts certain dogma in releasing products &quot;MVP, agile, user-centered design, user studies, etc&quot;.
Yet if these principles are being followed, why does the industry keep pumping low quality products, while Apple is the opposite?
Apple&#x27;s secrecy does not help. The few articles on google were either outdated (Job&#x27;s legacy) or blog with opinions and speculations.
What are they doing right that most tech companies miss? Or is it not design, but a distinctive leadership and strategy that works?
Some &quot;more verifiable&quot; sources:

Would love to hear from insiders if possible, thanks.

          <p>Hi all,
My name is Simone Di Nuovo and i&#x27;m the creator of tilepieces, an open source project to visually editing HTML documents and Web applications.
Tilepieces is a software that allows you to create applications for editing HTML documents, using some of the popular interfaces of the browser developer tools (with which it is possible to integrate css edits).
Tilepieces also allows you to reuse your favorite code and libraries, and exposes APIs that are useful for editing multiple files at a time.
You can start using tilepieces with its progressive web application version at https://pwa.tilepieces.net!
I will be happy to receive any comments from you.

          <p>Screenshot from a Codepen demo. Hovering on a grid item expands the grid tracks.

Somehow it’s already three months since I wrote about the CSS :has() pseudo-class landing in Safari Technology preview. The latest Safari (proper) release has just shipped with support, and can be enabled with a flag in the next Chrome release.
Meanwhile, I’ve been playing around with some ideas on how we can use :has() for styling a gallery or product grid layout. One of the cool things about the selector is that it allows us to not only style a parent element based on any one of its children, but to also style that child’s siblings too. So, building a menu, we could apply some styles to other elements in the menu when one of the links is hovered:
/* Style the list border when link is hovered */

          <p>I booked myself a week off work in late Feb and leading up to that date I started to get (back) into Gameboys. As a kid I grew up with a ZX Spectrum in the home and as a teen I had a Gameboy. I actually managed to use paper-round money to buy myself a pretty nice collection of games, but then for some reason sold it all off - only to then want to re-buy a Gameboy. I wasn&#x27;t so business savvy at that point.
Early on in the year I found that refurbishing Gameboys and modding them wasn&#x27;t too tricky for my own skills and as Feb started to come around two lots on Ebay piqued my interest: one with 8 Gameboys and another with 14. Of the 14, none worked (according to the seller) and of the 8, one worked (a Gameboy Advanced).
After much stress of bidding, I managed to secure the lots, plus purchased…</p>
