          <p>One quality of life improvement any developer can make for themselves is ensuring different file types open in the app they’re most proficient in.

          <p>Hello!
Last ditch effort here - a year ago or so there was posed a link to a page which had wonderful visual and text descriptions of different battery technologies and their tradeoffs.  It illustrated 5-6 different dimensions which one might optimize for (e.g. charging speed, capacity, cost, lifetime, etc) on these little charts which looked a bit like spiders&#x27; webs.
I thought that was a great resource, but didn&#x27;t save it at the time.  Anyone know what I&#x27;m talking about or have a link? Thanks!

          <p>Hi HackerNews,
As an early stage Product &amp; Tech Founder, we often wonder what is the good timing to have a Design System.
- Do you think it&#x27;s too soon during the early days?
- How do you manage product consistency without it?
- Do frontend engineers complain about not having one?
Our Founding Designer &amp; Product Manager, Mike, took the mic and tell us why he thinks you should have a design system from day 1: https://www.getlago.com/blog/how-soon-should-you-have-a-design-system
Happy to have your thoughts on this!

          <p>Today, Tumblr has something for everyone, whether you’re looking for art, memes, counterculture, or design inspiration. Designers, especially young ones, are making a silent comeback to this revived platform, which was considered “abandoned” by many back in 2018.
So what’s attracting Gen Z creatives to the microblogging platform?
As younger generations make the conscious decision to leave social media due to its “toxic effects,” the only logical next step is to create your own community so that you can express yourself freely without being bombarded by ads or obsessing over likes. In many cases, Gen Zers have been left without a creative outlet after ditching social media platforms, and Tumblr fits the bill perfectly.

To check if your payment provider is using the Payment Handler API, contact them

If you are using the Payment Handler API and CSP (Content-Security-Policy) for
better protection, you need to make sure the domains of HTTP requests sent from

          <p>When we started Chrome Dev Summit (CDS) in 2013, our goal was to connect directly with the web community. Each year I&#x27;ve looked forward to meeting with developers, learning what they were working on, and hearing their needs.  As we weren&#x27;t able to meet in-person for the last two years, our online CDS events were the best way for us to connect through AMAs, workshops, office hours and more.
Each year, we plan our engagements based on the state of the ecosystem to ensure we are addressing developers&#x27; needs as best we can. This year, instead of hosting CDS and asking you to come to us, we&#x27;re meeting you where you are in your region, at your favorite conferences and events, and on various online forums such as Twitter Spaces. Check out the list of events where you&#x27;ll find the Chrome team and bookmark this page to get the latest updates.
I&#x27;m so excited to get back into the community and we look forward to connecting with you at a virtual event, GDG DevFest, performance.now(), or another summit near you!</p>

          <p>Sharing tabs, windows, and screens is already possible on the web platform thanks to getDisplayMedia(). We’re now shipping the following improvements that guide the user away from accidental oversharing:
Sharing tabs is now the default option, rather than sharing screens.
The displaySurface option can indicate that the web app prefers to offer a specific display surface type (tabs, windows, or screens).
The surfaceSwitching option indicates whether Chrome should allow the user to dynamically switch between shared tabs.
The selfBrowserSurface option can be used to prevent the user from sharing the current tab. This avoids the &quot;hall of mirrors&quot; effect.
The systemAudio option ensures Chrome only offers relevant audio-capture to the user.

          <p>Just a heads up for anyone using their API - about 1 in 5 requests will return with Cloudflare Insights tracking JS. It&#x27;s not mentioned anywhere in the API documentation, Privacy Policy, or ToS.
Fairly certain this is the package they based their service on https://github.com/tdewolff/minify

          <p>Writing HTML sucks.
I&#x27;ve been making websites and web apps for almost 10 years. As a developer, I&#x27;ve never liked it.
React and Tailwind made it an infinitely better experience for me, but something was still missing. Switching between the code and the browser all the time felt wrong. At the same time, I felt lost with No-code editors because they are made for designers not developers.
I&#x27;ve written about it extensively here: https://rogovoy.me/blog/writing-html-sucks
Impulse is my experiment to bridge that gap and make a &quot;design&quot; tool that works directly with my code.
With Impulse, I&#x27;ve come to love web design (again?).

How did you get started in illustration?
Like many artists out there, it all began with drawing as a child. I’ve always been creative and have loved telling stories through both visuals and words. I took art classes as a kid and loved every second of it! However, when it was time to make a career out of it, I was nervous. I thought pursuing something like graphic design o…</p>

          <p>The DevTools Recorder panel lets you capture user actions on your page, replay, share, and export them to a variety of formats you can use in your CI/CD.
The Recorder panel is in active development and has recently added new features to help you edit, debug, and export recordings.


With the Recorder panel, you can:
Slow down the replay, set breakpoints, pause, resume, or advance the execution one step at a time.
When paused, interact with the page or switch to other panels for further inspection.
Add steps that the Recorder doesn&#x27;t automatically capture. For example, mouse hover that pollutes recordings otherwise.
Configure steps, for example, add timeouts, conditions, and assertions.
Export the recordings in various formats such as JSON, @puppeteer/replay script, and Puppeteer script.
Additionally, you can add more export formats using Chrome extensions for the Recorder panel. At the time of writing, you can add extensions for the following tools: Cypress, WebPageTest, Nightwatch, Testing Library, and WebdriverIO. Check out the full list of extensions.
For more information:
To learn the basics, see Record, replay, and measure user flows.
For a complete list of features, see Recorder features reference.

This change will give Chrome users increased safety and peace of mind while browsing and installing extensions by providing more transparency and control over permissions, adding stricter protocols for accessing resources outside the extension’s context, and ensuring that extensions work well on all devices.
Chrome will take a gradual and experimental approach to turning off Manifest V2 to ensure a smooth end-user experience during the phase-out process. We would like to make sure developers have the information they need, with plenty of time to transition to the new manifest version and to roll out changes to their users.

          <p>A complaint I sometimes hear about web performance metrics is that they focus too much on initial page load, unfairly skewering web apps that are actually fast but in different ways than traditional websites. The reasoning goes that many web applications are intentionally built more like native apps than like websites, prioritizing efficiency during lengthy browsing sessions after the web app is already open rather than optimizing for a first visit.
While I would argue that site delivery optimizations should not need to conflict with post-load optimizations (...and wonder if users carry their low performance expectations of native app startup time over to the web anyway), it is true that these represent different moments in user experience and need to be measured differently. Also, there a…</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32970485 target="_blank">Ask HN: Why aren&#x27;t modern mobile apps design to fail stable?</a>
          <p>I haven&#x27;t built mobile apps in years.  These days I carry an Android phone and am generally unhappy with how poorly these applications require a network connection to do anything. Many apps don&#x27;t fail stable in the sense that if there is a server error they don&#x27;t present the last known good view of data.  What this means in practice is if there is low network availability (on a train, at a concert or festival, a sporting event) many of these apps completely break.
Back years ago I would design apps to sync to a local database (which was relatively easy to do on IOS). Apps would maintain consistent state on the device and leverage local storage.  I haven&#x27;t looked under the hood but many apps appear to be using HTMLish front ends that are stateless, except for some cached login information.  As a user - what I see is that the app repeatedly tries to login and fetch all information every time you load it.  Which if you have perfect LTE/5G/WIFI is sort of ok, but in other situations sucks.  if the app can&#x27;t talk to the network it really doesn&#x27;t work at all.
Example apps that generally fail stable: gmail, text messaging
Sort of fail stable: slack, although if you get a push message slack requires talking to the network to get the message even though it came through the push message.  In practice this means significant latency between seeing the message on the phone and then going to the conversation view (which can take forever to load under poor networking).  Back when I built apps we stuck the contents of the push message in the local DB so it was visible for users

          <p>We all want to learn better. That means retaining information, processing it, being able to use it when needed. More knowledge means better instincts; better insights into opportunities for both you and your organization. You will ultimately produce better work if you give yourself the space to learn. Yet often organizations get in the way of …

          <p>I hate messing around with css and design is a real skill I haven&#x27;t taken the time to develop yet. I&#x27;m wondering if a tool exists that takes inputs: 1) raw HTML, 2) some webpage whose style I like (but don&#x27;t want to copy precisely). And outputs: HTML with styles applied.

          <p>I was using the Crunchyroll app on my iPad this weekend and noticed my level of frustration rising because the most annoying feature of the Crunchyroll iPad app is that while using it, I can do nothing else. The developers of the application didn’t add Picture in Picture or background play support. It’s either on fullscreen or off. The Funimation app has the same problem. While I’d like to watch anime while doing something else (shopping, Twitter, RSS, etc), I can’t.
On the web, this is only a minor annoyance. I open developer tools and…

document.querySelector(&#x27;video&#x27;).requestPictureInPicture()


I under-appreciate the ability to patch or coerce websites to meet my needs. That’s a feature of HTML, written in the by-laws as “consider users over authors”. As a user, I get the final say. Thi…</p>

          <p>This month I finished Michael E. Mann’s The New Climate War, a treatise on where we’re at with climate change. After my post on climate change a handful of people mentioned it and the book does a fantastic job at opening your eyes to the deflection tactics and information warfare that special interest groups (read, lobbyists) use to get you to talk about something other than their clients.
I could go on forever about ways this gross incentive system is destroying the world, but what I found most interesting about Mann’s book were the recurring cast of characters in the Climate Change disaster:
Activists - engaged and informed people, possibly with a plan of action
Inactivists - unengaged people, possibly adversarial
Technologists - people who (naively?) think we’ll solve the issue with tec…</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32941035 target="_blank">I continue to see improperly redacted images because of the iOS Markup UX</a>
          <p>I am a regular on a web forum where users quite often share screenshots from their iPhone, and in an attempt to redact identifying information in these screenshots, often do I find PII swabbed with the highlighting tool.
Even with the Opacity set to 100% and the color to Black, it leaves the sensitive information underneath visible (yes I understand this is a highlighter, move on this note below).
Before you tell me the proper way to do it, which is to ...
(once in Markup)
1. Tap the Plus button on the far bottom right
2. Select the Rectangle or Circle shape
3. Tap the Shape Options button in the bottom left (the icon used doesn&#x27;t even make it obvious as to what this button is for)
4. Select Solid Fill for the shape
5. Position solid shape over the sensitive information
...
My argument is that while it is possible to properly redact sensitive information, it&#x27;s much too easy for people to improperly redact because it is difficult to tell that a 100% opacity black highlighter does not work. On a phone screen, it can look completely opaque. Only once you see it on a better display do you realize just how visible the info is.
Also, while the pencil/pen tool (far left) does properly redact, its max size is much too small. People who use this one and just haphazardly try to scribble over all of the info, which sometimes works and sometimes doesn&#x27;t.
Solutions:
1. Create a tool specific for redacting
2. Make it so that 100% opacity highlighting is opaque (or at least warn the user if they set the opacity to 100%). Yes, this is not what &quot;highlighting&quot; is, but make the default opacity value like 30-50% and have people change it as needed. If it looks opaque on a phone screen, IT SHOULD BE.
3. Allow the user to set the max width of the pen/pencil tool much larger. Make it a sliding scale instead of 5 discrete sizes.

          <p>Last year I read the book 101 Things I learned in Architecture School. It’s a good book. Good enough, I thought I’d share 26 Things I learned from “101 Things I Learned in Architecture School”. Meta. A lot of this will, of course, be applied to web design.
6. We move through negative spaces and dwell in positive spaces.
This is probably the best argument I’ve heard for “why to use whitespace” I’ve ever heard. Negative/unused space makes the spaces with structure and/or content more impactful because we’ll dwell and feel more comfortable in the positive/filled-in areas.
This also explains why everyone ends up in my kitchen when friends come over.

          <p>One of my favorite #oldgold resources is Shmuplations; they scour old video game magazines and translate them to English. I love it so much I support the work on Patreon. Cruising through the archives, I found a translation of a 1989 issue of BEEP magazine which features one of my favorite sources of inspiration: Shigeru Miyamoto, creator of Mario.
When asked “What’s the secret to success in the game industry?” he had this to say:
Well, what’s worked for me so far is finding something I want to make that matches up with what the market currently needs.
If you believe in your idea, and that it’s something people will want, then all that remains is for you to polish and raise it to a sufficient level of quality. So no matter how talented of a staff you’ve been blessed with, if you don’t have a clear direction for your idea, I don’t think a good game will come out of it. The goal is for each staff member, individually, to contribute to the overall “finish” of the work, so it’s just a matter of having each person fulfill their role. And as the lead creator, even if the rest of the staff sometimes loses sight of the whole picture, it’s your job to hold the course and make sure you keep to that initial vision.
Unfortunately I’ve seen it happen many times where the developers get carried away with themselves, and they’re having a really good time, but it ends up harming the playability of the finished game.
Any time Miyamoto-san talks about “games” I map this to “websites” in my head. I’m endlessly inspired. These three short paragraphs contain multitudes.
Find something you want to make that matches up with something the market currently needs.

You need clear direction for your idea, even with a talented staff.

Developers getting carried away ends up harming the end product
All of these. Tattoo them on my soul. Especially the last one.</p>

          <p>Experts have a word for it. If it’s important, conceptual or frequently discussed, there’s probably a domain-based word that experts understand. The precision of a special vocabulary allows them to do better work. But… Just because someone knows the word for it doesn’t mean that they understand, or that they’re a useful expert. And… If […]</p>

          <p>TLDR: if your site is Twitter, AirBnB, Apple, Reddit, CNN, FedEx, or so many others then probably yes!
Many of the most common performance problems in websites and applications today are caused by how they load and rely upon JavaScript, and the difficulty involved in solving those problems often depends on the degree of that reliance. When JS reliance is minimal, fixing poor delivery performance can be as simple as instructing the browser to load certain scripts at a lower priority and allow HTML content to render sooner. But when a site is dependent on JavaScript for generating its HTML content in the first place, those sorts of optimizations can’t help, and in those cases fixing the problem may require deep and time-consuming architectural changes.

          <p>I came across a Circuit Breaker Podcast episode called Understanding Prototyping to Learn. This episode is a MUST LISTEN! Bob Moesta and Greg Engle come from a hardware/manufacturing product development background but it all applies to prototyping on the web. Bob and Greg give some much needed language to the discipline of prototyping.
The roles of prototypes
Did you know your prototypes can serve different purposes? Bob and Greg have big buckets for them.
Learning prototype
Communication prototype
Milestone prototype
These are wonderful categorizations of the roles prototypes can play. I often prototype to learn. My CodePen is full of these. I often prototype to communicate: “Here’s some progress, here’s why something can or can’t work”. It lets everyone see and experience the same tangib…</p>

Ok. It’s entirely possible, probable in fact, that that last sentence sounded like complete and utter gibberish (it’s definitely a bit of a tongue-twister) but free performance wins are rare, so let’s take a closer look at what’s changing, and how to understand whether or not your site is one of those getting a free performance boost as a result.

When agency resources are limited, every hire represents a major decision point. Even more so when it’s your first recruit.
It raises multiple questions. Will a new team member possess the right skills to hit the ground running? Can they be trusted to work directly with clients? How will you manage them?
And when exactly is the right time to hire? If your agency moves too early, you could face cashflow problems and have a new team member with not enough to do. If you hire too late, you migh…</p>

          <p>The algorithm surfaced me a video of an architect explaining why they make scale models and 💥BAM💥 just like that I’m back on my prototyping bullshit. This time we’re learning about the how and why an architect might make a scale model of a project.
The idea of model making for me is to take advantage of this haptic connection between your hands, what you’re making, all the materials, and really create something that you couldn’t have predicted in a sketch.
A prototype exists to make a haptic connection between you and the materials, a 3D sketch. A tactile feel with actual atoms that the sketch could not reproduce. Although these materials are far from the final product, you get a sense of volumes, spaces, and their relationships to each other.
I’m going to try and render these as open sp…</p>

          <p>A healthy but aging bearded man in a light vest walks the streets of the capitol city, weaving in and out of streets and light traffic, making his way to the local farmer’s market. It’s a typical sunny morning but the desert air is still cool from the previous night. The desert grasses along the road are a greener shade of brown thanks to the recent unseasonal rains, more flowers bloom than usual.
Human activity peppers the streets between the multistoried buildings. The citizens of the capitol walk through the downtown from shop to shop in unrestrained murmurations with  last-mile deliveries and priority access cabs as the only vehicles allowed on the roads. By afternoon most residents will retreat to their habitats to seek refuge from the heat.

          <p>I am working on a marketplace project(Patreon-like) and I am wondering about good designs/architecture to handle and track the money. I have came up with various solutions but I would like to hear from someone who has some real experience with this very niche type of project, if possible.
Mostly the issue is real money vs virtual money in the system. Chargebacks, returns, currencies, multiple bank accounts, multiple payment processors, fees for bank or payment processors transfers that can make real money mismatch the virtual money and so on.
It&#x27;s not a simple question I could ask and get a straight answer so I guess it will be more like a discussion.
Tanks.

          <p>I have a number of simple projects that I&#x27;m happy to do the UI development for but feel their appearance or UX could use some critique from a more skillful designer. I&#x27;m not looking to hire someone to do designs for these small personal projects, but am wanting to pay for a 30-60 minute consultation to get general feedback and suggestions for improvement.
Any recommendations for finding folks interested in this sort of one-off design review work?

          <p>It’s a classic complaint in relationships, especially romantic ones: “She said she was okay with me forgetting her birthday! Then why is she throwing dishes in the kitchen? Are the two things related? I wish I had a translator for my spouse. What is going on?” The answer: Extreme was right, communication is more than …

          <p>Last week I had the privilege of participating in Smashing Conference in Freiburg. One of the standout sessions was from Asim Hussain, of the Green Software Foundation, who talked about what a Net-Zero strategy means for organisations building websites. It was interesting to hear about the challenges of measuring the carbon emissions of a website, and the many different aspects that must be considered while doing so.
Asim pointed out that offsets are not an effective way of getting to Net-Zero, which might seem controversial to some, given that many companies that claim to be carbon neutral are at least partly counting carbon offsetting towards that goal. I’m inclined to agree with Asim here. Offsetting feels (to me) a lot like creative accounting: in the best case simply moving carbon aro…</p>

I plan to learn from reading the open source code, but I’d like to at least have some idea of its internal design, before I do.
Apart from a talk by Arun Thomas, can anyone recommend anything? Thanks.

          <p>Originally I used TextMate (well, &quot;originally&quot; I used GWD, but let&#x27;s not go back that far). Then, I don&#x27;t know why, I jumped ship to Sublime Text (which is still excellent), I dabbled with Brackets and Atom but eventually landed on VS Code.
I&#x27;ve been using VS Code for a lot of years (I tried to work it out), but a problem has been reoccurring over and over: VS Code is eating my CPU. It&#x27;s a big jump to return to Sublime, and until today, the prospect of finding the issue was…daunting.</p>

          <p>Hey,
It’s not been long since the last mail I sent out but I already got so many articles in the queue that it makes sense to send this now. The monthly schedule is a handy reminder for myself but I’m not dogmatic on this. As you know this is a personal, hand-crafted newsletter, so I think it’s okay to alter schedules as it comes.
This edition goes out right before I go to surgery next week. It shouldn’t be a big thing and they say I’ll be fully recovered two weeks after. As a creator and self-employed person I have a lot of ideas in my mind; My goal is to use the time off to calm down and rest a bit. I’m going to listen to nature sounds (see below), to binaural beats (just search in your favourite music app) and try to find a bit of calm.

          <p>I&#x27;m curious what your favorite solutions are for working with code, ideally with built in automatic code indentation and not too heavy on CPU usage.
This has been a pain for me as a Sublime Text user. I noticed it has quirks that make indentation a problem and without ease of readability my productivity suffers tremendously since  my work involves dealings with long nested functions.

          <p>Olivia Hoskin
      Writer &amp; Design Enthusiast 

Remember when Tidying Up with Marie Kondo was released on Netflix in January 2019, just in time for us to stay home for the most time we’ve ever spent at our primary residences? The Japanese organizing consultant that helps families organize their homes and embrace “minimalism” was definitely on to something.
When considering mobile app design, sometimes more is not always better. In fact, in most cases, more is not always better. The mobile apps below beautifully showcase minimalist design, helping users focus on the app’s content and intended purpose instead of the design itself.
We hope you enjoy these minimalist apps as much as we enjoyed curating them! ■

          <p># Container queries are here!
Exciting news—one of the most highly requested developer features has begun to land in web browsers! As of Chromium 105 and Safari 16, you can now create size-based container queries and use container query unit values in these browsers. To make it even easier to use size-based container queries and cq units, the Aurora team at Chrome has been hard at work updating the Container Query Polyfill to support more browsers and use cases so you can feel confident using this powerful feature today.
Container queries are a part of the css-contain-3 specification. This specification covers new unit values and both size and style container types, though browsers are initially launching with only the support of size-containment. Because of this, we’ll focus on size conta…</p>

Is this stuff being done by solo unicorns (frontend devs with good color + design instincts?). Or more often by teams of at least a few people.
Is it a quick process that&#x27;s often right the first time, or am I looking at months of design iteration and testing when I see a UX that looks even &#x27;nice&#x27;.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32837397 target="_blank">Ask HN: Why is Disney+ UX so bad?</a>
          <p>A few weeks ago I bought a one month Disney+ subscription to check it out. I have all kinds of problems when using their web player compared to Netflix and YouTube:
- subtitle settings get reset every time I close the website.
- the button for changing subtitles is in the upper right corner. Once you open the menu the button for closing it appears in the upper left corner. You can&#x27;t close the menu by clicking outside of it, despite the fact that you can still see the blurred video in the background.
- pressing space doesn&#x27;t pause the video, but repeats the last action you did. If you closed the subtitle menu by pressing esc, pressing space will open it again. If you entered the full screen mode, pressing space will close it.
- there is no way (afaik) to open a list of all episodes from within the player. You have to go back to the show&#x27;s main page, choose the season (because it always defaults to season 1) and scroll a horizontal list (which always defaults to the first episode) using a button that appears only once you hover it. Scrolling with a mouse scroll/touchpad doesn&#x27;t work.
- it is impossible to search for movies using a director&#x27;s name. For example, I know that Disney+ has a lot of Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s and Wes Anderson&#x27;s movies available - they are my favorite directors - but I couldn&#x27;t quickly check which specific movies there are.
I know that it&#x27;s possible that I have higher standards of UX because I&#x27;m a programmer, but I doubt that Disney+&#x27;s interface is intuitive to anyone.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32832474 target="_blank">Ask HN: Why is the iOS UI difficult to maneuver?</a>
          <p>I recently purchased an old iPhone 11 Pro Max to try out, after being an Android user the last 12yrs, last phone being the Oneplus 7. I knew there would be big differences and I tried to be as accepting as possible along the way.
It&#x27;s been a few weeks now and I would really like to hear from current or former iPhone users on their thoughts about iOS&#x27;s maneuverability.
My thoughts:
The iOS UI thrives on having the user perform tedious steps to perform very simple actions [1], is difficult to use in one hand (I understand there are smaller models but I wanted a bigger battery, this should not excuse the lack of maneuverability), and THERE IS NO UNIVERSAL BACK BUTTON! When you need to go back, you have to figure out how the current app wants you to go backwards. Swipe from the left edge? anywhere on screen? or exit using the button at the top of the screen? It&#x27;s a guessing game every time.
I really want to like this phone, the hardware is incredible and the software support for years is terrific. Could long time users please chime in on how they got used to it?
[1] Reaching to the top right corner to drag down the Control Panel. Having to press the &#x27;Select&#x27; button in Photos instead of long pressing a photo. Having to tap a toggle icon exactly for it to change status.

          <p>Using CSS, it’s possible to prevent users from selecting text within an element using user-select: none. Now, it’s understandable why doing so might be considered “controversial”. I mean, should we be disabling standard user behaviors? Generally speaking, no, we …

          <p>The new school year is here and for those of us in the northern hemisphere, it’s time to say farewell to the short-lived summer. If you’re a designer or content creator, you may be looking for that spark to make this back-to-school season more fun, and potentially a pathway to a new source of income!
The $104.2 billion and increasingly growing creator economy is on a roll and with that comes a new wave of content creators. People today engage with more than one social media platform, making it more important to have a broad understanding of each. You may think the creator economy only revolves around the mega digital stars with over a million followers, but the fact is that micro-influencer marketing will grow at a faster rate than traditional influencer marketing in 2022.

          <a href=https://css-irl.info/detecting-css-selector-support/ target="_blank">Detecting CSS Selector Support</a>
          <p>You might already be aware of how we can use feature detection in CSS to check whether a particular property and value combination is supported. This is a pretty smart way to go about writing robust CSS that caters for users with a whole range of browsers and devices with different capabilities, and is infinitely preferable to user agent sniffing. We can check whether a browser supports aspect-ratio, say, and provide a fallback in cases where lack of support would hamper the user experience.
.some-element {
  max-height: 200px;
}
@supports (aspect-ratio: 1) {
  .some-element {
    aspect-ratio: 1;
    max-height: none;
  }

          <p>The goal of the Open UI initiative is to make it easier for developers to make great user experiences. To do this, we are trying to tackle the more problematic patterns that developers face. We can do this by providing better platform built-in APIs and components.
One such problem area is pop-ups.
Pop-ups have had a rather polarizing reputation for a long time. This is, in part, due to the way they get both built and deployed. They&#x27;re not an easy pattern to build well, but they can yield a lot of value by directing users to certain things, or making them aware of the content on your site—especially when used in a tasteful manner.
There are often two major concerns when building pop-ups:
How to make sure it gets placed above the rest of your content in an appropriate place.

Kevin Tome

Tell us about your background. Do you have any previous design experience?
Hi, I’m Kevin, based in Ontario, Canada. I’ve been in design for 8 years, and I’ve mostly specialized in marketing and brand design. I really enjoy UI/UX and wanted to pivot my career. I find product design a refreshing change of pace.
Why did you choose Dribbble’s Certified Product Design Course?
Dribbble’s Product Design Course seemed very accessible and I’m a big fan of Jesse Showalter. My good friend took a UI/UX Dribbble Course, and really e…</p>

          <p>Disclaimer: Thought Experiment. Does not need to be &quot;practical&quot;. Let your NIH flow and your imagination run wild
We&#x27;ve learned a lot about computers in the decades we&#x27;ve been producing. A lot of software assumes that computers work a certain way. See Go lang and how it handles file permissions. In the Linux Kernel drivers exist that supports the IBM 3270 Display System which at this point is over 50 years old. Terminal Emulators mimic the VT100. All of this makes sense given the context in which they were developed and created. But if you were developing an OS in 2022 without these constraints what would you remove and or change? Would you keep 32bit support? Arm, Risc and or x86?, monolithic or microkernel?, C, Rust, Zig, D, C++, or something else?, how would it talk to hardware?, what would your executable format look like?
Also if anyone has any interesting links to cutting edge research into Modern Operating Systems I&#x27;d love to browse them!

The course was founded upon learning materials that I had produced to teach in-person conference workshops, and made it possible to offer these materials to a wider audience online. While technical in nature, the course content was aimed not only at developers, but at web practitioners of all kinds who were interested in improving their understanding of web performance concepts and how they relate to creating faster, and more resilient experiences for their users.
That positioning acknowledged a change that was happening in the web performance world at the time and that indeed continues today. Technical web performance concepts are becoming increasingly relevant to a wide varie…</p>

          <p>During the system design interview, my colleague gave a common question that was found in System Design interview. The candidate seems to be able to give a perfect answer (covering what the book is advising).
Objectively the candidate passed. But deep down I felt that passing the interview doesn&#x27;t show me about what real life design problems that the candidate have faced before.

          <p>August brought about some pretty sweeping changes. Kids are going back to school and I’ve found myself stepping back from some commitments.
Running out of spoons
This month I ran out of spoons. Neck-deep into starting a company and feeling that ambient stress, I realized I’m running out of available bandwidth. This manifests in tiredness, grumpiness, back pain, etc. I made the tough decision to step back from some extracurricular activities: a podcast, Open UI, my DnD group, and a handful of other obligations.
A lot of it comes down to something I mentioned in my post about PARA, the idea that projects have an end date. Almost everything I do ends up being an open-ended project. I need to reset a bit to hedge against that tendency.
Twitter overhaul
In the interest of protecting the spoons …</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32780191 target="_blank">Ask HN: What happened to vanilla HTML/CSS/JS development?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;m not a web developer, but I dabble in it because I find it interesting. I went through some courses like The Odin Project and others to learn the basics of HTML/CSS/JS, and I thought it made a lot of sense: HTML structures the page, CSS handles the style, and JS handles the functionality.
However, after working for software companies for a few years, it seems like almost nobody uses these technologies in the way they&#x27;re presented on websites like w3schools to make web applications. Instead, they use component-based frameworks like React. To me, these frameworks seem way more complicated than HTML/CSS/JS, and I don&#x27;t understand what problem they&#x27;re trying to solve. What makes the trade-off of all that extra complexity and abstraction worth it? Aren&#x27;t HTML/CSS/JS perfectly fine and time-tested tools for web development on their own?

These are a few relevant blog posts if you are new to C/C++ debugging and the Memory Inspector:

# Introduction
The Memory Inspector provides you with more powerful debugging options for linear memory buffers. In the case of C/C++, you can inspect C/C++ memory objects in the WebAssembly Memory.

          <p>Hey HN,
I made this free browser extension that modernizes the Hacker News design.
I previously launched Modern for Wikipedia [1] here back in December, and it seemed like the obvious next choice to build one for HN too!  So I&#x27;ve taken what I learned from building that, and have spent all my spare time this year building Modern for HN.
I realize this won&#x27;t be for everyone, but it was a fun project to work on, and I&#x27;m really happy with the result so far. Hope you like it too!
Lots more planned for future updates, and suggestions welcome :)

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32753619 target="_blank">Ask HN: What were your first steps in system architecture/design?</a>
          <p>I have only had around 2 YoE as a backend developer, but I already have a deep interest in system design.
That said, I have realistic expectations in that becoming a software architect requires field experience with different systems, patterns, making mistakes and learning some lessons the hard way.
Nonetheless, I already started learning at least the theoretical foundations thanks to:
* Designing Data-Intensive Applications
* System Design Primer
* Web Scalability for Startup Engineers
* System Design Interview by Alex Xu
* Quastor subscription
* Infoq talks, etc.
My interest is only increasing, and I try to participate as much as possible in architecture-related discussions at work with the more experienced developers.
Thanks to the learning resources, it&#x27;s no longer a problem to understand the theory, but due to lack of experience, I understandably feel anxious and unconfident thinking about designing something myself.
Let me make it clear, I understand that with that little experience under the belt, you can&#x27;t suddenly become a software architect after having read a book.
However, some day everyone should start. It would be really cool to find out how currently experienced software architects started their path, designed their first systems, what they would recommend to optimize and fasten the learning process.
Thanks!

          <p>We have a few hundred sites serving their nav 
menus using a shared CSS file located in a private Github repo. This file is hosted via Netlify with CloudFlare in front.
This afternoon we started receiving a number of reports of broken nav styling on the US west coast. On loading these sites, the minified CSS file was replaced with the word &quot;hello&quot;.
No commits have been made to this repo since May.  I checked the commit history of the minified file and &quot;hello&quot; was never written by accident at any point. Clearing out the CF cache addressed this.
Thoughts?

We’ve also continued to iterate on a few other projects to help folks get up and running with Bootstrap with npm, other JS frameworks, and various build tools. Keep reading to learn more.
Key changes
We’ve updated our calc() functions to work around an apparent bug in postcss-values-parser that prevented our source Sass files from compiling properly when building with React and PostCSS. The fix was to reverse the order of our multiplication inside calc() functions. Be aware you may need to make similar modifications depending on your own customizations.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32741902 target="_blank">Ask HN: Why do companies want us “back in office” despite productivity costs?</a>
          <p>I might be too &#x27;junior&#x27; to grok what goes behind the curtains. When I did a quick survey amongst my software friends, all of their workplaces have been pushing for bringing people back in offices. Some are a bit soft and coy about it (&quot;From November, we will allow you to choose WFH for half the week!&quot;), And some are straightforward &quot;you have to&quot;.
In my workplace, the management itself reported high remote productivity. Despite this, we will be asked to work remotely only half the time. They even have a big new building in city center location.
Is it simply something cynical, e.g. Trying to hold on to prime real estate, or somplyyabout control? Or is there indeed legitimate net benefit to working in offices?

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32730788 target="_blank">Ask HN: Where do you host your CSS files?</a>
          <p>We currently have a web app hosted on the cloud. The HTTP server does server-side rendering, including serving up static CSS and SVG files.
For reasons, the web server framework doesn&#x27;t support 
caching out-of-the-box and we hand-roll our own.
I thought we might as well complexify our deployment step instead and reap some performance benefits. Immediately, I thought to use Amazon S3 for the CSS files. Does any one else do this? Is there something lower latency than S3?
