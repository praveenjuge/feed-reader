          <p>Hi, I&#x27;ve been playing around with doc2.site which uses Google Docs to create web pages. I tried several Chat GPT plugins to enhance my doc content with semantics like headings, emphasised text etc.
The problem is I always get plain text responses from Chat GPT (and plugins) even if you ask for the HTML output and then if you copy paste the output into Google Docs, you get the HTML tags like 
blah
.I found a script that does copy the output as HTML:
&quot;const blob &#x3D; new Blob([html], {type: &#x27;text/html&#x27;});&quot; so it&#x27;s super easy actually but I couldn&#x27;t find a plugin that handles it nicely like a copy paste response as HTML button.

This will not change the release date for Chrome stable or early stable. It will, however, align the beta release date across platforms. Before Chrome 114, the iOS release went to beta a week before the Desktop and Android releases.
The following table shows how this change affects the 114 release.
Stage
      Chrome 114 (Old)
      Chrome 114 (Revised)
    
Feature Freeze
      Thu, Apr 6
      Tue, Apr 11
    
Branch 
      Thu, Apr 20
      Tue, Apr 25
    
Beta Promotion
      Thu, May 4
      Wed, May 3
    
Beta Promotion (iOS)
      Wed, Apr 26
      Wed, May 3
    
Stable Cut
      Tue, May 23
      Tue, May 23
    
Stable Cut (iOS)
      Tue, May 16
      Tue, May 23
    
Early Stable Release
      Wed, May 24
      Wed, May 24
    
Stable Release
      Tue, May 30
      Tue, May 30
    
Note that Chrome 115 stable will be delayed for two weeks to accommodate the July release freeze, all dates after this have been adjusted to account for the two week delay.
You can keep track of upcoming releases on the Chrome Status Roadmap, and see the schedule in detail on the Chromium Dashboard. We publish a post on this site for each beta release, so you can keep track of upcoming changes to Chrome.

          <p>After Google reader went away, I used netvibes for quite a while which works great on a web browser (although the mobile view is unusable). However, it seems the new owner has lost interest - more and more bugs keep showing up and there is no way to contact support. So I&#x27;m looking for a new reader. It would be great if it had a fast, minimalist web interface, mobile support, generous free tier (long enough for me to decide whether I like the service or not) and customer support.

CSS now supports nesting rules.
The algorithm to set the initial focus on  elements was updated.
No-op fetch() handlers on service workers are skipped from now on to make navigations faster.
And there’s plenty more.
I’m Adriana Jara. Let’s dive in and see what’s new for developers in Chrome 111.
# CSS support for nesting.
One of our favorite CSS preprocessor features is now built into the language: nesting style rules.
Before nesting, every selector needed to be explicitly declared, separately from
one another. This leads to repetition, stylesheet bulk, and a scattered authoring
experience.
.nesting {
  color: hotpink;
}
.nesting &gt; .is {
  color: rebeccapurple;
}
.nesting &gt; .is &gt; .awesome {
  color: deeppink;
}
After nesting, selectors can be

          <p>Does anyone use an alternative GitHub UI? I was thinking of making my own with nothing much more than plaintext and links. My main problem with the default UI is it has too much friction for something I use so often, and the page that loads when I type github.com (the dashboard) is an unnecessary distraction.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35429834 target="_blank">Ask HN: Best design for an Alexa-like voice powered ChatGPT</a>
          <p>I&#x27;m obsessed with OpenAI and ChatGPT and I want to work on a voice powered version so that I can just chat with it directly.
I find the streaming text based response distracting and honestly I&#x27;d just like to talk to it as if it were a partner/collaborator.
My thinking is to use OpenAI Whisper as the Speech to Text (STT) input:
https://openai.com/research/whisper
Then stream the results to a Text To Speech (TTS).
I&#x27;m going to use the raw OpenAI chat API to access GPT directly.
I&#x27;m going to OSS it and put it up on Github.
The problem I&#x27;m having now is that I need a way to stream the output of ChatGPT to the the TTS system.
I think I need something BETTER than the Google Cloud Speech API so I&#x27;m looking for a recommendation.
My idea is to buffer the output from GPT until I have 1-2 sentences, THEN start streaming that, on sentence boundaries, to the TTS system.
That should enable both low latency responses but also give the TTS system a decent chance of making the results sound like an actual human without any jarring breaks (at least I hope)
The problem is that the Google Cloud Speech API doesn&#x27;t have a streaming API.
Though I guess if I only send 2-3 sentences at a time that I can aggregate these in the client and keep the latency small.
Thoughts?

          <p>I wrote a book about absolute nothingness, or at least alluded to its omnipresence, and uploaded it to a fun, somewhat formatted static site for free.
I think when I wrote it I wanted someone to discuss it with, but I’ve since realised it’s a very boring topic to many, and still most get offended by the mere challenging of their beliefs.
It’s not to say I am certain what this book says is correct, but that I would love to understand another’s point of view of… well, nothing at all.
I’ve been a little too obsessed with this concept for a few years now, and don’t regret writing the book, but can’t help but think I could have had a few more discussion if I wrote about, literally, anything else (that isn’t nothing)

          <p>Hot on the heels of our second alpha, we’re releasing a third (and unexpected) alpha for v5.3.0 today with some fixes for some Node Sass compilation errors. In addition, we’ve added a handful of other updates. We’re still on target to ship our stable release soon!
Once again, if you’re new to the v5.3.0 alpha releases, please read through the Migration guide for the first alpha and last month’s second alpha.
Here’s a look at what’s changed in this quick release:
Fixed wrong interpolated variables with node-sass/Hugo.
Added a check for interpolated variables to catch compilation errors with Node Sass when using Sass variables in calc() functions.
Started using --bs-border-radius variables across more components.
Added .d-inline-grid utility class.
Fixed .tooltip-inner placement when using variations in fallbackPlacements.
Fix selectors for dark mode carousel overrides when compiling with $color-mode-type: media-query.
Updated the styling of floating labels when “floated” to include a background-color to help with multiple lines of text in textareas. This also fixes the colors when form elements are disabled in floating forms.
Updated RFS to v10.0.0.
Get the release
Head to https://getbootstrap.com for the latest. It’s also been pushed to npm:
npm i bootstrap@v5.3.0-alpha3

If AI can automate many of the tasks these developers currently perform, how will we have new senior developers and architects in the future?

          <p>Our habits, preferences and idiosyncrasies make perfect sense. We each know that we have great reasons to embrace our ways and stick with them. Other people’s habits, though, show that they are simply picky, weird or too sensitive. The difference between a preference and a foible seems to be mostly where we’re standing.</p>

Tried googling this, but it&#x27;s been SEO/content marketed into oblivion so I don&#x27;t even know where to ask this question.

          <p>We made ParallelGPT - a tool that lets you bulk process chatGPT on a spreadsheet UI instead of one-by-one conversation style. Hopefully this saves you time and hassle - especially if you want to build an operational process around it and want to collaborate your team.
You can give it a quick spin on this live demo playground: https://demo.rowy.io/table/parallelGpt#sideDrawer&#x3D;%22table-i...
I am the co-founder of Rowy(https://www.rowy.io), an open-source low-code platform, and we built ParallelGPT as a fun showcase of what you can do with low-code.
There are tons of exciting AI apps you can build with low-code, and we&#x27;re always happy to chat about any ideas you have and assist on our Discord.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35386850 target="_blank">Ask HN: How to address the anti-pattern of inferring design rules from mockups?</a>
          <p>At work, we recently discussed the issues arising from UX/UI designers using visual tools like Figma or Sketch to create mockups that front-end developers have to manually reverse-engineer into HTML/CSS. While these tools provide useful means of visual expression, they often lead to developers having to infer design vocabulary from the mockups themselves, causing a loss of value and potential misinterpretations.
As a community, how can we bridge the gap between visual and text-based web design to preserve design reasoning and intent? Are there better ways to communicate design requirements without relying solely on visual mockups? How can we emphasize the importance of a clear connection between description and visual presentation in modern web design tools to avoid costly mistakes and improve accessibility?

Few of them require a blood oath or even much inconvenience. “I’m thrilled that you’re contributing.” “Can’t wait to see how this turns out.” “I know someone who really needs to hear about this.” “Go make a ruckus, it matters.” If we want […]</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/devtools-tips-23/ target="_blank">DevTools Tips: What are source maps?</a>
          <p>Source maps let you keep your code readable and debuggable even after you&#x27;ve combined and minified it, without impacting performance.
  
  

When using various transpilers, minifiers, and bundlers, the code you deploy differs from the code you author. To improve network performance, these tools compress the code into a single line, remove unnecessary characters, and shorten variables.
Many tools can generate source maps to accompany your code.
Chrome DevTools reads both the deployed code and source maps and lets you debug your code as you normally would, even with breakpoints.
To better understand how source maps work, check out the source maps visualizer.
Additionally, source maps can have extensions. If you build tools and frameworks, consider supporting them. Check out this Case Study: Better Angular Debugging with DevTools, where the DevTools Team and Angular improved the debugging experience in DevTools by supporting the x_google_ignoreList extension.

          <p>Hi HN, we’re building Noya (https://noya.io), a product design tool that lets everyone design like a designer. Here’s a video: https://player.vimeo.com/video/797476910.
Getting from a product idea to a design is too hard. Wireframing tools (e.g. Balsamiq) are limited and their output is too low-fidelity to get people excited about the idea. On the other hand, high-fidelity design tools (e.g. Figma) require advanced skills and are better for tweaking fine details than hashing out a big picture. Meanwhile, companies have an insatiable need to make new screens and change existing ones, and hiring more designers is time-consuming and expensive.
David and I were on the design tools team at Airbnb when we realized there’s another solution: let designers encode their knowledge (e.g. design rules …</p>

          <p>Greetings!
YakGPT is a simple, frontend-only, ChatGPT UI you can use to either chat normally, or, more excitingly, use your mic + OpenAI&#x27;s Whisper API to chat hands-free.
Some features:
* A few fun characters pre-installed
* No tracking or analytics, OpenAI is the only thing it calls out to
* Optimized for mobile use via hands-free mode and cross-platform compressed audio recording
* Your API key and chat history are stored in browser local storage only
* Open-source, you can either use the deployed version at Vercel, or run it locally
Planned features:
* Integrate Eleven Labs &amp; other TTS services to enable full hands-free conversation
* Implement LangChain and/or plugins
* Integrate more ASR services that allow for streaming

          <a href=https://codeprompt.xyz/ target="_blank">Show HN: CodePrompt – a UI for loading code repos into GPT prompts</a>
          <p>Hi HN, I&#x27;m Chun Rapeepat.
Last week I started playing with GPT-4 and tried different ways to use it to optimize my dev workflow. It was fun, and I was just blown away by what GPT-4 can do.
The idea of CodePrompt first came to mind when I read &quot;Show HN: GPT Repo Loader – load entire code repos into GPT prompts&quot; [1]. It was precisely what I wanted to do! So I tried it.
The GPT Repo Loader works pretty well on a small codebase; However, due to its limitations in loading all files and content into the prompt, I still ran into token context limit issues and needed to copy/edit the code myself.
That&#x27;s when I started working on CodePrompt. Instead of loading the entire repo, why not just load only relevant files or portions of code (or function headers?) that need for the requirement?
How I designed the user journey of CodePrompt.xyz:
1. Choose a GPT model.
2. Select a repo that you want to work with.
3. Pick the relevant files that you want to include in the prompt.
4. Add specific instructions and remove irrelevant codes as needed.
5. Copy the prompt to your chosen GPT model to generate the desired output. Chat &amp; Iterate.
6. If you want to do something else, just go to (3) again.
This allows me to easily generate prompts to do something like 
- Implement features that evolve edits on multiple files
- Create new components while reusing existing codebase
- Generate code with the same style as other files, etc.
I would love to hear all your feedback and ideas on how I can improve it. Or if you want to chat, feel free to ping me on my Twitter @chunrapeepat.
P.S. The project is 100% open-source and free to use.

          <p>Like jq but for postgres databases (or sqlserver, csv or even xlsx).
What&#x27;s neat is that you register a database with the system, then you can query against that particular database.
Very nice that I can use this on the command line and then pipe into jq for more data manip.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35350969 target="_blank">Ask HN: What are some tools/techniques that greatly increased your productivity?</a>
          <p>I ask this because so often I see people recommending tools and techniques by saying things like &quot;this dramatically increased my productivity!&quot; or &quot;this sped up my workflow by an order of magnitude!&quot;
How can we take such claims seriously? Most things do not improve our productivity THAT much. However, some things truly do.
Let me give some examples of things I think truly have &quot;dramatically improved&quot; my productivity.
  - testing, specifically integration tests
  - memory safety (garbage collection, borrow checker, etc.)
  - version control (git, etc.)
  - closures and lambdas
  - unix pipes and the idea of composing larger programs out of smaller ones
  - Chrome debugger when working with javascript
    - I hesitate to say &quot;debuggers&quot; in general because I actually think GDB didn&#x27;t &quot;dramatically&quot; improve my productivity back when I programmed in C. And I don&#x27;t even use a debugger at all when I program in python. But the Chrome debugger has numerous features I use all the time.

  - static type systems
    - could be a small win but I don&#x27;t find myself &quot;dramatically more productive&quot;
  - TDD
  - IDEs
    - some IDEs are better than others, but I have yet to experience a dramatic increase in productivity simply by using a new IDE. Text editor + terminal is pretty strong tbh.
  - serverless architecture
    - I could see the argument for scaling concerns, but at a smaller scale I don&#x27;t see a productivity boost compared to a monolith Rails/Django app
  - classes and class-style OOP, inheritance
    - I haven&#x27;t written a class in a long time, and I haven&#x27;t used inheritance in a REALLY long time. I just don&#x27;t think these are huge wins in most cases. Note that I&#x27;m not even advocating for FP here. I program in a procedural style most of the time in all honesty.

Thanks! I look forward to seeing the replies.

          <p>Hi everyone!
I&#x27;ve been really frustrated with the way Notion.so exports your data.
I felt like I was locked into their environment, because the exported files don&#x27;t resemble the original Notion pages very well.
This HN post really motivated me to take matters into my own hands: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35316679
I built notionSnapshot - a HTML export tool for Notion that looks just like the original pages (it&#x27;s actually a fork of loconotion if you already know that project).
Anyway - it took me longer than expected to build and I would really appreciate your feedback.

          <p>Two joycons for the Switch and though the thumbstick worked fine, none of the buttons worked.
I had assumed it was a loose connection, but it turns out that the shoulder buttons - L and R - had been crushed (from heavy usage), which looked to have caused a short which knocked out all the buttons.
It was simple to test by removing the crushed buttons from the PCB and the rest of the buttons came back to life (during the test).
The right joycon is trickier because the shoulder button is directly soldered to the PCB and it being crushed meant that the pads had all been ripped, but I managed to expose the super tiny traces and solder to those. But in future, there&#x27;s easier contact points to jump to.
Otherwise, now all the buttons work, and TIL: mash the shoulder buttons can equate to a totalled joycon!</p>

Also allows mixing in new code blocks one by one, so you can have a REPL-like conversation and add/overwrite JavaScript functions one by one.

          <p>I am interested in knowing how a bidding system works from a system design perspective.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find a detail design for this.  There are a couple of challenges that I can think of:
- many bidders for a specific item requiring multiple nodes
- accepting a bid is a transaction?
- ordering of bids as they come in
- invalidating bids once and reflecting that to a customer very quickly
Usually systems that are distributed that also need to be fast choose eventual consistency, but I am not sure how that would work in a bidding environment.  Any detailed resources (papers, blog posts, videos etc...) that I can review?  Thanks!

          <p>As a web designer, accessing online resources and tools is an essential part of your work. However, there are times when certain websites or services may be blocked or restricted, preventing you from accessing the content you need for research or inspiration. Sound familiar?
Online security and privacy are other concerns for professionals working in this field. That’s where proxies come in handy. These tools can provide web designers with greater flexibility, security, and performance when working online.
But before we explain how you can use them to make your projects more efficient and effective, let’s explore what proxy servers are and how they work.

          <p>In the past few days, I have read a lot about different variations of Flash Translation Layer. Most of them are designed for specific architectural designs. However, what about the most common solution that is widely used in today&#x27;s SSDs on the market? I know that this part of the SSD&#x27;s firmware is considered proprietary, as well as the device as a whole.
Any suggestions how this might be implemented?

          <p>Hey,
in my area, spring is arriving and while today we had some snow falling again, I’m regularly in my market garden again, planting vegetables, sowing radish, salads, carrots and more. It’s still such a great balance to my web work that I can only recommend having an outdoors activity to all those sitting in front of screens all day.
In my current projects, TypeScript, React and other tools are set as defaults. But I also realize that a lot of the standards I have in my mind are still not a default: responsive image optimization, bundle optimization, code splitting, performance audits and budgets, accessibility checks. Is it worth the effort of building type-safe code that in the end is transpiled anyway when we’re serving a nearly 1MB one-in-all JavaScript bundle containing scripts, sty…</p>

          <p>If you’re trying to build a single page application (SPA), you should probably use a tool designed primarily for the job. Site generators focused on performance, shipping low to zero-client-JavaScript (e.g. the one I work on, Eleventy) typically use full page navigations. SPA advocates have rebranded this architecture as a Multi-Page Application (MPA) but fundamentally this is how the web has always operated.
Classic multi-page architecture has a few benefits:
Better empty-cache performance: your site can render faster.

As web browsers become more privacy-focused and users spread their browsing across multiple web-capable devices, empty-caches visits are increasingly common.
Faster sites make more money. Read WPO Stats.
Search engines use site performance as a search ranking signal, which…</p>

          <p>I&#x27;m thrilled to share with you all a personal milestone in my life that I feel compelled to celebrate. My girlfriend, Julia, has been pursuing her dream of becoming a UX/UI designer for almost a year now while working in logistics, and today she has finally published her first project!
I can&#x27;t express how proud I am of her for putting in the hard work to make her dream a reality. It&#x27;s not easy to balance work and study (you know, sleepless nights to chase a dream), but she has done it with great determination.
Now that Julia has completed her first project, she&#x27;s excited to take the next step in her journey and is actively searching for job opportunities in UX/UI design. If any of you have any leads or know of any open positions in this field, we would be immensely grateful for any advice or guidance you can offer.
I know some of you may think it&#x27;s a small feat, but to us, it&#x27;s a significant accomplishment worth toasting. As a community of innovators and dreamers, I hope we can all take inspiration from Julia&#x27;s story and strive to follow our passions relentlessly.
Let&#x27;s raise a glass to Julia and all the aspiring designers out there who are working hard to turn their dreams into reality. Cheers!

          <p>I made this as a toy/proof-of-concept. This is a port of [Maestro](https://maestro.mobile.dev/) but for the web platform. Uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) under the hood.

          <p>A long read, but a worthwhile one - in my head their voice was definitely just shy of shouty! :)
Being a JS developer first and foremost since pre-Node days, it puts me in a funny spot that I absolutely agree with everything said in this article, whilst also considering that I pick JS on the server to suit me.
When it comes to the front-end, I&#x27;m pretty sick of the poison that&#x27;s been sold to us for over a decade.
The web&#x27;s war for JS libraries/etc summarised excellently with:

It’s a popularity contest. Plain and simple.


And that popularity contest can change on a dime.


10 years ago, it was AngularJS.


Today, it’s React.


Tomorrow, it will be something else because that’s inevitable.

Absolutely this - I felt exactly the same when I had peers and colleagues trying to shove Angular down my throat.
But it&#x27;s the future, the kids who come to the industry and will continue it. As Jared White writes,

but all those bright-eyed eager newcomers getting churned out of code schools knowing only React?


Those jobs will be gone. 😕

Grim future.

          <p>I have a little Etsy store for gameboy repair (though it&#x27;s currently just carts at the moment), and I had a Pokémon Crystal come in. It didn&#x27;t load at all and I found corrosion around the cart pins.
Carefully scratching away the solder had it loading up again, but the far right contact (the ground) had solder under the gold finger and I was worried it&#x27;ll eventually fall away. Originally I wanted to swap all the parts to a new PCB, but that requires actually purchasing another Pokémon Crystal (which sell for around £20-30) - which didn&#x27;t make sense.
Ultimately I cleaned as much as I could under the pad and then used solder mask to secure the gold finger down and now it&#x27;s secure and safe for a good many years of usage. Returned to a very happy customer :)</p>

          <p>TL;DR: Does anyone know of an AI-based voice app that allows you to manage calendar and mails?
I’ve been searching around a lot and couldn’t find a virtual AI (I.e cheaper than humans) assistant/app that’s voice based that allows me to manage my calendar and emails; I wanna be able to check what’s coming, quickly send attendees some follow up information, mail people, schedule new meetings etc. I’d be realistic about the quality and not use it for the most important customer communication etc but I’d assume AI in the last year has come far enough that some Startup us created such an app?

          <p>Our second alpha release of v5.3.0 has landed with a ton of enhancements and bug fixes for our new color modes! There’s still more to come, but we’ve held off shipping until we ironed out enough issues. Huzzah, we have!
This v5.3.0 release is a monumental update for Bootstrap 5. It’s big enough that it could’ve been a v6 on its own, but we wanted to do right by the community and get color modes out the door without the massive major release upgrade. We’re getting super close now, so bear with us as we continue to chip away at this.
And, in the meantime, here’s the rundown on what’s changed since our first alpha. Have a read through the Migration guide for the first alpha, or the blog post for the release announcement, if you’re just getting into v5.3.0.

          <p># Required background
The post Deprecating and removing Web SQL announced the deprecation of the Web SQL database technology. While the technology itself may be deprecated, the use cases addressed by the technology very much are not, so the follow-up post SQLite Wasm in the browser backed by the Origin Private File System, outlines a replacement set of technologies based on the SQLite database, compiled to Web Assembly (Wasm), and backed by the origin private file system. To close the circle, this article shows how to migrate databases over from Web SQL to SQLite Wasm.
# Migrating your databases
The following four steps demonstrate the conceptual idea of migrating a Web SQL database over to SQLite Wasm, with the SQLite database backed by the origin private file system. This can serve as th…</p>

          <p>I always wanted to make some sort of web app. As a .Net dev, I’ve used Winforms quite a bit. Even though it’s long outdated, I always found it intuitive for simple little apps.

          <p>Hey there!
I am Kevin, a graphic designer for 12 years. I&#x27;ve had my fair share of communication mishaps and countless modifications. I soon realized that starting off projects with professional survey forms made all the difference in the world!  Thanks to these survey forms, my design business flourished, and my clients could truly appreciate the artistry in my work. And now, I want to share that experience with you!
dotBRAND is a collaboration platform that&#x27;s like having a co-pilot by your side, helping you communicate with your clients. At its core, dotBRAND provides professional survey templates to gather all the essential client information, files, and design intentions in one go!
Please give me your suggestions/feedbacks  on dotBRAND, I would be deeply appreciated!!

          <a href=https://remysharp.com/tif/2023-03-15-ps2 target="_blank">PlayStation 2 controller [tif]</a>
          <p>Bought faulty - only the thumb sticks and start/select worked. I figured there was a broken trace in there somewhere and something that would be simple to fix.
Or perhaps a build up of carbon on the silicon pads that &quot;just&quot; needed cleaning.
It turns out that these controllers, instead of bridging the pad when the buttons are pressed, use a resistor (the dark rectangles) that when pressed, the resistance increases (or decreases…though I&#x27;m fairly sure increases) and that is measured.
The problem is that over time, as they&#x27;re pressed more and more, the resistance naturally builds up as the resistor fails under the physical pressure and eventually it can&#x27;t tell when the button is depressed.
The only solution is to buy an entirely new membrane (seen in the photo). But now it works!</p>

          <p>As part of a joblot, and because I wanted to play Metroid: Return of Samus, I got hold of this 3DS with multiple faults.
Firstly, it wouldn&#x27;t always power up (it would flick on power then go off), and when it did the bottom screen was severely corrupted.
The bottom screen required a new display, and the power not working is a common problem with the Nintendo DS range. Specifically if the top display isn&#x27;t connected properly - or if the ribbon cable is pinched from the hinge (a common fault), then during boot up tests the device will power down.
Luckily for me, I was simply able to reseat the ribbon connector and then swap out the bottom display and it was right as rain in 30 minutes flat!</p>

          <p>I had an old and very, very corroded copy of Super Mario 2: The Golden Rings for the Game Boy. I&#x27;d previously restored it but as one commenter suggested, the corrosion will continue to eat away. So the other night, using hot air and a lot of flux, I transferred all the parts to a new PCB and Mario is right as rain again.</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35251794 target="_blank">Ask HN: How will AI change UI?</a>
          <p>I just saw this blog post by Bill Gates on the top of HN:
&quot;The Age of AI has Begun&quot;
https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-Age-of-AI-Has-Begun
Gates writes that in his lifetime, two tech demos have struck him as revolutionary:
* Charles Simonyi&#x27;s demo of a graphical user interface (GUI/UI) in 1980
* OpenAI&#x27;s demo of an AI passing an AP Bio exam last year
How will these two technologies co-exist and influence each other?
What kinds of existing UIs will AI make obsolete? Or rather, what kinds of existing UIs are holding humans back from utilizing what AI can do?
On the flip side, what kinds of new UIs (aside from chat interfaces) could AI enable? What kinds of UIs are needed to let the power of AIs shine?

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35245329 target="_blank">Ask HN: So many software projects, but no reliable productivity metrics?</a>
          <p>I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on ways to understand (intentional not saying measure) productivity of software engineers with metrics. I know it&#x27;s a polarising topic and difficult to tackle. Usually the path of discussion goes to &quot;commits are not relevant&quot;, &quot;my situation is unique&quot;, &quot;requirements are changing&quot;, and so forth. But in the same time, after so many projects delivered and considering the maturity of tooling we have today (acknowledging that this make it also very complex), there are many, many things which are kind of predictable and similar to other delivered products. Outside a small percentage of developers which work on innovations, r&amp;d and areas which by nature are unpredictable, the vast majority are just doing the same stuff.
So what are your ways of understanding that someone is productive or not which is not based on gut, perception and other subjective factors?

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35236635 target="_blank">Ask HN: Why doesn&#x27;t OpenAI care more about ChatGPT&#x27;s UX?</a>
          <p>Like many people here, I have been using ChatGPT almost since its launch. Considering the massive adoption, I am a bit surprised that the interface hasn&#x27;t evolved one bit in 3 months.
My issues:
-  Why is there no shortcut to my account/profile settings from ChatGPT&#x27;s left panel?
-  Why are my DALL-E money and ChatGPT/API money kept separate? These are two products from the same company, asking twice for my CC number.
-  Why do I have to refresh my page manually every time something went wrong? Couldn&#x27;t the page either refresh itself or recreate a clean connexion?
-  Why isn&#x27;t there a &quot;log in&quot; button from OpenAI&#x27;s landing page, plus a SSO detecting that I am already connected and linking (for instance) to my account, the products I use, etc.?
-  Why are their URLs so confusing? DALL-E is living at &quot;labs.openai.com&quot; (for the actual product) or &quot;openai.com/product/dall-e-2&quot; (for the product presentation). For ChatGPT it&#x27;s &quot;chat.openai.com/chat&quot; (why &quot;chat&quot; twice btw?), but it&#x27;s &quot;platform.openai.com/playground&quot; for the playground. Of course no page links to the others so you have to go back to the landing to access any of them (or access them through Google).
-  And finally, why is the search on their website so bad? I was looking for the playground, but &quot;openai.com/search?q&#x3D;playground&quot; sucked so much that I had to use Google to find it. And we are talking about an AI company indexing its own pages.
I understand OpenAI has other important things to do right now, but these are minor issues that would take a mediocre dev a few days to fix. This would easily make me 10% happier with a 1/1000000th of the resources needed to improve their models. Also, remember that Google got huge in the beginning by caring about stuff like this. So, why does nobody care?

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35223553 target="_blank">Ask HN: Semantic” CSS Framework?</a>
          <p>When I make applications on my own account that are server-side rendered I frequently use CSS to style things in a way similar to what I think CSS was intended for initially,  that is,  I apply styles to meaningful parts of the document (e.g. &quot;div.statusbar&quot;, &quot;table.postlisting th&quot;.)
Frequently I work on these things on and off for months or years and eventually they become a hot mess.
I&#x27;m looking for something that will help me have some discipline.  I do not like BEM, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and other frameworks that want to impose alien structures on CSS.  I like the intention of SASS/SCSS but don&#x27;t like the idea of complicating my build system.  (I like the idea of CSS Nesting as it works in Chrome but Firefox doesn&#x27;t have it yet unfortunately.  I want to use the latest features but I need support for Firefox and Mobile Safari with Chrome as a distant third.)  I would consider using a JS polyfill and I am using jinja2 template so anything I can bake into my python back end (maybe compile &amp; cache compiled CSS) would be possible.
Any advice for frameworks or other organizing principles?

The purpose of the tool is to save hours spent on writing Jira tickets and bring clarity to what&#x27;s supposed to be built by Engineering. 
This tool works for front end products for now.

          <p>Hi HN – we are Brandon and Brayden (confusing we know), and we are building Outerbase (https://www.outerbase.com) a better interface for your databases. Think Google Sheets or Airtable, but on your relational database. We provide a collaborative UI on top of Postgres, MySQL and other databases, enabling teams to view, edit and visualize their data.  Here’s our short demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;38RslBYdZnk
Accessing data is a challenge to team members who aren’t data analysts or engineers. Databases are usually locked down to a few team members, and everybody else has to rely on them to get access.

A motor on a computer chip

I watched a video where Carl Bugeja is prototyping a PCB motor. A PCB motor the size of a quarter seems… ahem… revolutionary when it comes to creating small movable parts. Carl is up against a lot of physical limitations in this quest to blend mechanical and electrical engineering; namely temperature. If the temperature goes to high, the device melts and fails and that is bad for the success of his invention.

Did you try adding something like ChatUX for your software product? Any other UX experiments you have tried? What were your learnings?

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/android-webview-header-privacy/ target="_blank">Improving user privacy by requiring opt-in to send X-Requested-With header from WebView</a>
          <p>When a user installs and runs an application that uses a WebView to embed web content, the WebView will add the X-Requested-With header on every request sent to servers, with a value of the application APK name. It is then left to the receiving web server to determine if and how to use this information.
We want to protect the user&#x27;s privacy by only sending this header on requests if the app developer explicitly opts in to share with services embedded within the WebView. To achieve this and let current online services that depend on this header migrate away from using it, we will run a Deprecation Origin Trial, while removing the header for general traffic. In parallel, we will be developing new privacy-preserving APIs (such as client attestation APIs) to match the use cases where the X-Requested-With header is being used today.
You can read more about why we&#x27;re making this change and how it works over at the Android Developer&#x27;s Blog in Improving user privacy by requiring opt-in to send X-Requested-With header from WebView.</p>

          <a href=https://remysharp.com/tif/2023-03-09-gba target="_blank">Game Boy Advanced wouldn&#x27;t turn on [tif]</a>
          <p>The usual story, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. The first place I start with GBAs, in particular, is the power switch. If it&#x27;s dirty it can prevent the device from starting or it can affect the &quot;quality&quot; of power, i.e. the power LED flashes from green to red.
Although the board itself looked in good condition, once I lifted the whole thing out, it turned out a transformer (better known as T1) had cracked open and the coil of wires were all over the place. I replaced that and power returned.
The original GBA had a funny story attached, it was in an original pink shell and the (I assume) kid that owned it wanted something &quot;cooler&quot; (again, assume, but indulge me), so they used a black marker pen all over it.
However, this board was destined for the teal(ish) shell and available to buy.</p>

          <p>My son has been telling his friends that I can fix things, so I&#x27;m starting to see more gaming bits arrive via them! This joypad wasn&#x27;t registering movement properly in both thumbsticks.
I thought it might need replacement thumbsticks (actually bought some but they didn&#x27;t fit) but it was actually a damn good cleaning with IPA that it needed.
IPA FTW.</p>

          <p>I was kindly sent a Pebble Time Steel as a possible replacement for my own Pebble Time watch - and though it was in great condition and it powered on when charging, as soon as the power was disconnected, the watch powered off.
I hunted down the right replacement lipo battery, the SP551923AE thankfully available on AliExpress. Heated the watch to melt the glue, opened and careful soldered the replacement battery onto the Pebble PCB (because I didn&#x27;t want to remove the original battery connector and add it the new lipo battery - it seemed like a risky job).
A tiny job, but a very nice result.</p>

          <a href=https://remysharp.com/2023/03/11/i-had-a-good-week target="_blank">I had a good week [blog]</a>
          <p>Though it&#x27;s only been a few days since my last entry I got to the end of that week and took some stock and realised, aloud, that I had a good week.
Again, this is for me and those who know me. The usual tech nonsense will resume (one day!).

I hadn&#x27;t written anything on my blog for a while, or at least nothing that had flowed naturally so my &quot;flavour of funk&quot; post did come easily and it was good.
The Monday before that post (the evening before) I attended a (nearly impromptu) meetup run under Beyond Tellerrand from Marc Thiele and Storyblok. I saw friends who I&#x27;ve not seen in, what felt like a long time. I felt physically sick the whole time, in my guts but seeing talks, hearing ideas, seeing my friends faces - it was overall positive.
The next day I finally returned to the gym. It was gentle and I wrote the aforementioned blog post on the treadmill. It flowed out of me and the responsive was warm and friendly (thank you).
That evening I also had dinner with a long standing friend. So long that we agreed that we&#x27;d meet on the same day every month - which makes making sure we see each other much easier. It was nice, and they&#x27;d read my post (and are probably reading this post too, so hey ❤️).
Finally on the Thursday I started individual therapy (or counselling) properly (I&#x27;d had an introduction session the week before). I realised, and had to think carefully about it, that I had had a good week.
In the week that followed (last week), I&#x27;ve been trying to focus my thoughts on positive things to tell myself. I&#x27;m working on quietening down Bob&#x27;s voice in my head, and when it&#x27;s quiet, I&#x27;d like to begin to fill that emptiness with positive things, nice things, in my head.
It&#x27;s still early days, like those early pages in a book, those first weeks on a diet or at the gym, but it&#x27;s positive. I&#x27;m hopeful.</p>

          <p>Hello, I was wondering what computer monitor setup helps your productivity for game design. Do you use one curved monitor? Or multiple square monitors? Or some combination? Personally, I use two and had been thinking it is annoying not to have a dedicated area for code, game engine, api, chatgpt. It seems like a difficult balance to see proper information at once.

          <p>Do I need to get an EE master’s (VLSI focus, interested in this field) to understand the field better so that I can use AI to improve chip design and manufacture life cycle (as a CS grad)?
I am a cs grad, but I liked electronics since first year&#x27;s summer break when I took a practical course in electronics, then I played around with embedded systems &amp; ai &amp; robotics and web dev&#x27;s study materials for all of my college years and never got past any intro course in any of them. now after graduation I feel like I know nothing and interested in a lot of things and not being able to decide what to choose. now I am interested in both ai &amp; vlsi and can&#x27;t decide between:
1.using ai to automate the build process of ic chips. or,
2.using vlsi to design ai-specific chips to advance the field more and more.
being ignorant about both fields, I can&#x27;t make a decision. and I feel like I have to study both no matter what order of the two I pursue. so, I chose to start with ai as a tool for solving problems and then later in my career I pursue an MS in EE to understand the kind of problems in this field and how to solve it using ai. and this order is safer for me, giving my cs background, than to shift my career to EE as a fresh grad.
does this make any sense, or I am just wasting my time for lack of experience to decide?
and what is the job title for something like this? is it related to a VLSI CAD engineer?

          <p>Hey HN,
Similar to resumes, traditional job descriptions feel outdated. There is a lack of standardization in the industry, some mention compensation, some mention hard requirements, some are more flexible in requirements.
I&#x27;m curious if you were to build a job description standard, what types of fields would you want included? Some ideas of the top of my head:
- Compensation Bands
- If hard requirements are present, an explanation of why (i.e we don&#x27;t have capacity for mentorship, so we are looking for X years of work experience)
- LinkedIn of the hiring manager
- LinkedIn of the existing team
- A detailed over of the interview process
Would love to know what others think!

      Writer &amp; Design Enthusiast 

With humble beginnings as a rubber manufacturer in Finland in 1865, Nokia has come a long way. After making its name as a communications company producing arguably the most indestructible cellphones, this tech giant is ready for a new adventure.
The pivot into a more service-oriented business model as a B2B innovation and tech company comes with a new brand identity, including an updated logo to shift perceptions of the company from a mobile phone company. The new logo has a more geometric and abstract approach, balancing visual evolution and instant recognition.
Some say that the “new Nokia” resembles a distant echo of the original logo since so many elements have been stripped away. A bold graphic was used throughout all content, repurposi…</p>

          <p>Beginning gradually in Chrome 113,
storage, service workers, and communication APIs will be
partitioned in third-party contexts.
In addition to being isolated by the same-origin policy, the affected APIs used
in third-party contexts would also be separated by the site of the top-level
context. Sites that haven&#x27;t had time to implement support for third-party
storage partitioning can take part in a deprecation trial to temporarily
unpartition (continue isolation by same-origin policy but remove isolation
by top-level site) and restore prior behavior of storage, service workers, and
communication APIs in content embedded on their site.
In addition to a general unpartitioning deprecation trial, it&#x27;s possible to
participate in a focused deprecation trial just for window.sessionStorage.

Warning
In our efforts to work on future enhancements to this feature, we broke it in Chrome Canary. Oops! But hey, that&#x27;s what Canary&#x27;s for. If you want to try view transitions today, use stable Chrome 111, or beta Chrome 112.
These kinds of transitions were a frequently-requested feature from developers, including me, and I think we&#x27;ve managed to land it in a way that balances good defaults with extensibility and customization. That sounds like we&#x27;re patting ourselves on the back, but developer feedback was key to the design of this feature. An earlier pro…</p>

The Recorder introduces support for custom replay options that you can embed into DevTools with an extension.
Try out the example extension. Select the new custom replay option to open the custom replay UI.
To customize the Recorder to your needs and integrate it with your tools, consider developing your own extension: explore the chrome.devtools.recorder API and check out more extension examples.

          <p>Federated Credential Management API (FedCM) is a
web API for privacy-preserving identity federation. With identity federation, an
RP (relying party) relies on an IdP (identity provider) to provide the user an
account without requiring a new username and password.
FedCM is a purpose-built API that allows the browser to understand the context
in which the RP and IdP exchange information, inform the user as to the
information and privilege levels being shared and prevent unintended abuse.
# Updates
There are a few updates to Chrome&#x27;s FedCM implementation:
For the ID assertion
endpoint, IdPs need to
check the Origin header (instead of the Referer header) to see if the
value matches the origin of the client ID.

          <p>Hi HN!
I am quite excited as this is my second product, launched today: Versionfeeds.
https://versionfeeds.com
What is Versionfeeds? I was quite annoyed by the fact that I had no central place where I could see all the software releases. I use software a lot, be it at my job, to build my side projects, or tools hosted on my NAS at home. It&#x27;s literally dozens, if not hundreds of tools, packages or even programming languages. And most of them receive updates regularly.
That is why I built Versionfeeds. It allows me to bundle all the releases for the software I need and love, into one dedicated feed. At the moment, all public repositories on Github and Gitlab are available. You can also search on npm (Javascript) and Packagist (PHP) for your software. More providers will come soon.
The feeds adhere to the Atom standard and can be consumed with any feed reader. If maintainers use markdown in their release notes, it will be converted to HTML.
Any feedback, wishes and ideas are welcome. Please share your thoughts with me. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35069802

          <p>I&#x27;m planning on making a small web app using SSR rather than splitting the backend and client work. In researching options for the project (Go based), I&#x27;ve &quot;discovered&quot; that there&#x27;s a _lot_ more to templates than what I&#x27;ve used in the past (Jinja2 via Django, Flask, and Ansible).
So to the actual web developers here, what template engines do you use and why? I&#x27;ve never worked with compiled templates but they seem interesting, though I don&#x27;t know their cost/benefit tradeoffs very well yet.
Your choice of language, stack, syntax preference, what-have-you! I&#x27;m just genuinely curious about the broader templating ecosystem and workflows.
