          <p>I really hope that the collective intelligence of Hacker News has answers, because this is the type of question that you cannot ask on stackoverflow.
The question is exactly as the title says. The following text provides context, but if you already understand what I am after, you can skip it.
----------------------------
In 1992, when we saw Visio for the first time, we  hoped that one day we would be able to use it for creating software design documents visually, and then deploying them with the press of a button. Visio is a general-purpose diagram-drawing application, so it cannot do that, but it has always supported linking and embedding, so in theory it could be used for this purpose by a specialized software design tool. However, I have never head of any such tool.

          <p>In October Chrome will take the next step in reducing the information
available in the browser&#x27;s User-Agent (UA) string, to improve privacy for users. With
this change, websites and services that rely on the User-Agent string for
certain information may need to take action. Here&#x27;s some background on what&#x27;s
happening, why Chrome is making this change, and what you can do to prepare.
# Why is User-Agent string changing
The User-Agent string includes information about the browser and the type
of device a person is using. The UA string has played an instrumental
role for websites that
want to customize user experiences as well as for anti-fraud providers who rely
on this information to identify bots and malicious attacks. Chrome is committed
to maintaining those important use cases.

          <p>The Console Utilities API lets you speed up your debugging workflow by providing a variety of shortcuts.


With the Console Utilities API, you can:
Stop typing long commands like document.querySelector() and, instead, use jQuery-style $ shortcuts to specify elements.
Refer to the last five DOM elements you selected on the Elements panel.
Quickly refer to elements by their XPath, which you can copy in the Element panel.
Query objects by their constructors.
List just the keys or values of objects.
Copy string representations of objects to clipboard.
Get event listeners.
Monitor events and function calls.
For a comprehensive list of all the Console Utilities API shortcuts, see the Console Utilities API reference.</p>

          <p>Hey HN, 10 years after the project began we have updated the UI for the cloud server comparison site known as EC2Instances.info. This refresh brings a sticky filter bar so you can scroll and see what filters are applied, a more compact navbar, and improved UX for comparing instances.
I&#x27;ve also fixed numerous long standing UI bugs including: comparisons now load correctly on RDS and ElastiCache, sort by max ENI works, sort by RDS instance storage works, and all dropdowns have consistent behavior.
For maintainers and contributors, all the frontend libraries are upgraded to their latest versions, https://github.com/vantage-sh/ec2instances.info. Going forward, we are aware that the homepage size is quite large and have plans to address this.
We have tried to be good stewards of this project and evolve it carefully. Eager to hear what you think of the new UI!

          <p>Hey there..
I have started writing a book on software design/architecture that provides a different perspective than existing books out there. The thesis of the book is that &quot;code is for humans&quot;. The book explains how to write code that is optimal for our primitive monkey brains. The book describes how many of the best practices in software stem from deficiencies in our cognitive abilities. It expands on best practices such as (DRY, SSOT, etc) and brings new ideas on what is good code and how to write it.
I am looking for someone to partner with on this book as it&#x27;s a huge project and I would love to be able to split the work.
I have written a rough outline and filled in about 40 pages of notes, examples and text. The project is still very much in it&#x27;s infancy.
A bit about me: I worked as the software architect of a 100+ person team at Mobileye/Intel and have many, many years of experience working on a variety of software from self driving cars to web apps.

          <p>I&#x27;m a cs student who have been selling a very specific and niche bicycle part. I have already sell quite a few locally using facebook marketplace. I recently tried Amazon and sold a few but was shocked by the 15% cut.
I&#x27;m wondering if I can/should make an online shop using vanilla html and css with PayPal/Stripe API payment buttons. I only have 3 product models and don&#x27;t need shopping carts as most people would just buy one item. Shipping fee will also be fixed. No need for SEO or analytics. I have made a few websites before and enjoy making simple lightweight ultra-fast websites, so time spent on developing the website wouldn&#x27;t be a cost to me.
Any security / legal / business aspects that I should consider?

          <p>I was just preparing a demo for an upcoming talk and it suddenly occurred to me that cascade layers would be a perfect solution to a problem I was having.
For any element of live coding, I like to meticulously prepare my demos to prevent any moments of friction on the day. I wanted to apply a bunch of default styles to a grid of cards in this container queries demo, but I wanted those styles to appear at the bottom of the stylesheet, so that when it came to live coding the demo I could write all the relevant code at the top, and the audience could just focus on the layout styles I would be discussing. However, there were a few styles that consequently wouldn’t be applied, as they would have been overridden by those further down. For example, at the top of the CSS file I want to apply a con…</p>

# What is FLEDGE?
FLEDGE is a proposal to serve remarketing and custom audience use cases while protecting user’s privacy. When FLEDGE executes the ad auction between buyers (DSP) and sellers (SSP), the client receives real-time signals from the FLEDGE Key/Value services. Real-time signals are critical because they provide information, such as the budget for a buyer, when a bid is calculated. They can also provide information about an ad creative to a seller, to help decide which ad is shown to the user. Without these signals, buyers and sellers are not able to conduct basic operations that the ad industry relies on.

          <p>Suppose that HN user Foo wishes to DM user Bar. HN knows their real email addresses, so Foo emails Bar@hndm.com, and HNDM auto-forwards this to Bar&#x27;s real email address. If Foo wants a response from Bar, Foo needs to tell Bar their (Foo&#x27;s) real email address, and Bar can email them directly. The only accepted/understood direct reply to one of these forwards is &quot;block&quot;, which will forever block Foo from sending to Bar. If Foo gets three blocks, they&#x27;re disallowed from sending HNDMs until the they are under three blocks, which clear at one block/week.

          <p>One aspect of web development I’ve always loathed was working with forms. Form elements have been traditionally difficult to style due to OS and browser differences, and validation can be a nightmare. Luckily the native HTML APIs added methods for improving the form validation situation. With input[type&#x3D;number] elements, you can add min and max attributes. […]

          <p>The top layer sits above its related document in the browser viewport, and each document has one associated top layer. This means that elements promoted to the top layer needn&#x27;t worry about z-index or DOM hierarchy. They also get a neat ::backdrop pseudo-element to play with. The Fullscreen API spec goes into more details as Fullscreen was a great example of the top layer in use before dialog support came along.
The top layer helps solve the problem of rendering content above the rest of the document.
The important things to remember:
Top layer is outside of the document flow.
z-index has no effect in the top layer.
Each element in the top layer has a styleable ::backdrop pseudo-element.
Each element and ::backdrop generates a new stacking context.
Elements in the top layer are stacked in …</p>

At the moment I am not opting for something like leetcode. I want something that teach me the principles of how to actually design from the fundamentals.
Also I want to be as much language agnostic as possible. By that I mean the ability to think about algorithmic solutions to problems in terms of mental models that I can then translate to a low level language like C, or a dynamic imperative language like Python, or a functional language like Racket, SML or OCaml. Of course, the assumption here is that I must know the language I want to implement the algorithm in. So basically I want to learn about algorithms in a paradigm agnostic way so that I can implement them in any paradigm I want.
How to go about this? Do you have any book or course suggestions in mind?

          <p>Hoping the collective wisdom of HN can help me with this one:
I&#x27;m currently archiving a site for a client which was built in WordPress [I know! I know!] by creating a static version from it. So I&#x27;ve used &#x60;curl&#x60; to download the entire site and spent a few days stripping out the tangled mess of WordPress cruft.
Next in my sites is the CSS. I&#x27;ve consolidated the eleventy billion CSS files strewn throughout WP into one central CSS file, which is about 3000 lines long. And now need to strip out all the unused selectors... of which I suspect there are many, because the site is mostly just plain text articles with occasional illustrations. No fancy-schmancy stuff at all.
Plenty of advice on the web about using Chrome Dev tools to check for unused CSS against a single page. But this is a site of 500+ pages, so I need something that will crawl the entire project and compile a list of all the CSS used/unused across the entire site.
On the face of it this seems like one of those horribly repetitive tasks which would be a nightmare for a human to do, but trivial for a computer. A solution wouldn&#x27;t even need to automagically strip the CSS out. Even just marking the used elements would allow me to see what was required or not and manually delete the rest. Pseudo-code-ually:
  for HTML file in project 
  look for class&#x3D;XXX or id&#x3D;#YYY
  look through project CSS file for .XXX or #YYY
  insert comment /*this is used in file ZZZ.html*/

          <p>My wife and I recently submitted to a mobile game jam on Newgrounds (yes, it&#x27;s still around). What started as a question of whether we could do it somehow morphed into whether we could do without so many of the seemingly needless complications rampant in our respective industries. My wife thus did all the art as traditional frame-by-frame animation (no puppets or tweening) and I preceded without a game engine. I did use a pre-processor that gives JS a Lisp syntax (Parenscript), because C-syntax is gross. We hope the end result, while definitely of small scope, will serve to inspire some thought as to what is and isn&#x27;t needed in your next project.

          <p>While running a UI/UX design team for B2B startups, I do enjoy coaching developers from time to time. Helping them become better at recognizing why something feels ugly or off and how to find solutions quickly.
I wonder if people would be interested in a weekly UI/UX design challenge over email. And where I pick one or two submitted designs to provide deeper analysis and tips on how to make it better and why.

          <p>Last month, at Lazy Load, Paul Calvano gave a presentation where he dove deep into HTTP Archive to uncover some common performance mistakes. One of the issues he explored were sites that preloaded resources that never actually end up being used by the page.
The preload hint is a way of indicating to the browser that a particular resource will be needed for that page, and that the browser should request it now, when the preload hint is encountered, rather than waiting for later discovery. When used selectively and sparingly it can be a great way to help resources that the browser won’t discover in the HTML itself—a background image referenced in CSS, a JavaScript file injected by a script loader, etc—arrive much earlier.

Every brilliant design starts with an amazing idea, as well as hundreds of not-so-amazing ones. To the user’s eye, these rejected concepts aren’t at all visible, however, their experience would be nowhere near as delightful if mistakes, iterations, and learnings didn’t happen during the design process.
In the Double Diamond, a familiar framework and close friend to the design community, the third stage is where the brainstorming and ideating really kick off.

          <p>Following on from the previous announcement, support of HTTP/2 Server Push will be disabled by default in Chrome 106 and other Chromium-based browsers in their next releases.
# Why is this being removed?
HTTP/2 Server Push allowed websites to proactively send resources needed by the page instead of waiting for them to be requested. However, it was problematic as Jake Archibald wrote about previously, and the performance benefits were often difficult to realize. As a result, it was not used much with only 1.25% of HTTP/2 sites making use of this feature.
Analysis of the use of HTTP/2 Server Push has mixed results (Chrome, Akamai), without a clear net performance gain and in many cases performance regressions.
Push was not implemented in many HTTP/3 servers and clients—even though it was inc…</p>

          <p>Chrome DevTools makes debugging CSS grid layouts intuitive with a variety of visualization options.


Watch the video to learn how to toggle the grid overlay in the Elements panel and use it to:
Visualize and inspect grid layouts.
See row and column numbers to refer to when placing grid items.
Use line and area names and see them on the overlay if you have a lot of grid items and the numbers are confusing.
Check track sizes.
Additionally, with the Grid Editor in the Elements &gt; Styles pane, you can align items and their content in a grid layout with a click of a button instead of typing CSS rules.
For a more hands-on learning experience, follow the Inspect CSS Grid tutorial.</p>

          <p>Third-party resources (such as embeds and scripts) are heavily used across the web today. They provide out-of-the-box solutions for embedding social media, videos, analytics, live chat, advertising, A/B testing, personalization, and others. Third-party embeds are a necessary part of modern websites that allow site owners to focus on their core competencies, while offloading standard but critical functions to external providers.
When both first party and third parties on a web page work in harmony, it is possible for a page to deliver a great user-experience. However, this requires significant effort from both engineering and business teams and is often overlooked, resulting in less than performant web pages and a negative impact to user-centric metrics such as the Core Web Vitals.

          <p>In my team, I suggest that before starting coding/implementing any middle-size/big feature (e.g., an HTTP endpoint that, supposedly, needs a new db table) the engineers involved (which usually involves all the backend engineers) should have a &quot;design&quot; session where:
- potential high-level solutions are discussed
- potential implementations are discussed (not low-level details, but at least the important/risky ones)
- and once a &quot;final&quot; decision is made, whoever is in charge of pushing the feature live to production can start with the implementation. The rest of the team can review the implmentation later on knowing that it should follow the final decision the team agreed on
The team doesn&#x27;t like the approach that much because:
- it takes time (&quot;Omg, yet another meeting?&quot;)
- &quot;review of the …</p>

          <p>Hello HN!
I have been a hobbyist programmer for the last 3 years or so, and along the way, I have always wanted to be a game developer/designer.
While I got some small success for myself, most of my games are terrible and not really fun, in terms of concept and gameplay. I don&#x27;t consider myself a person that good at writing stories (or anything other than programming) and often find my games bland and boring pretty fast.
So, what I&#x27;m asking now is some advice. Any game devs here who has gained some success (whether veteran or not), what is your advice for starting game dev? What are your resources and books for learning about game dev and game design?

          <p>Is RSS still actively developed as a protocol? If not, why not? Are there any viable alternatives on the horizon?
I find it really troubling that we seem to have resigned ourselves to web content discovery and distribution belonging to corporations like Google and Meta.
Also grateful for any reading recommendations on this subject, both on RSS specifically and on the question of web content discovery/distribution broadly. (I’ve read through most of the stories/posts pronouncing RSS dead or resurrecting it and I’m not convinced either way.)

          <p>I’ve been using GitHub Copilot full time over the summer and have collected my thoughts on this new industry redefining tool. It’s a product that has the potential to impact my life greatly and a product that’s a mix of helpful, clumsy, and potentially dangerous. Let’s dive into some of the good and bad parts of Copilot.
The $10 price point is perfect because it makes me mad
The pricing model for Copilot is my favorite part. $10/month doubles my GitHub costs. That’s almost one Netflix… to have tab completion!? $10/month for copy-pasta from StackOverflow? No way, José.
On the other hand, if you asked me, “For ~$100/year, I can make coding a little easier. Do you want that?” I am an unequivocal “Hell yes.” For 27¢/day I can have a robot buddy help me write code? Even if it’s only a little he…</p>

Tell us about your background. Why did you decide to learn product design?
I’ve worked as a graphic designer for four years, primarily at my current company and on freelance projects.
Why learn product design? Funny story. Two years ago, I made a bet with my girlfriend that I was going to learn programming and get a job offer in one year. Keep in mind, I had never seen a line of code in my life and with my background in marketing, math and logic weren’t my stronges…</p>

          <p>I&#x27;m at the point where I am starting to write shaders to do custom effects in WebGL,  such as combining a left and a right image to make an anaglyph image.
What I&#x27;m thinking about next is about how to make &quot;game like&quot; UIs on the web for desktop and mobile.  Some things that I am inspired by are:
(1) The Playstation 3 interface https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XrossMediaBar
(2) Interfaces in video games for viewing a database or documentation about the game world.  I&#x27;d like to make something similar but for some part of the real world.
The Pokédex from Pokémon is a familiar example but it&#x27;s not such a good one because Pokémon games mostly run on low-spec handhelds,  so I am thinking more about what you&#x27;d see on a PC or TV console games...  But instead of using a game controller you&#x27;d be using the touchscreen,  mouse or keyboard.
(3) However I very much like how games for the Nintendo DS/3DS use the touchscreen such as peeling stickers in Paper Mario Sticker Star and how you can make Luigi fight in the boss battles in Mario and Luigi Dream Team.  So some advanced capability for touch gestures is wanted.
I&#x27;d prefer programming in Javascript,  could accept Typescript but it would be a hard sell if it (say) compiled something else to WebAssembly unless that came with awesome capabilities.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32440171 target="_blank">Show HN: Agency quality design and development for a very un-agency like price</a>
          <p>Howdy HN! Been working on a side project of mine for about a year called Gloutir. It&#x27;s essentially an &#x27;agency of one&#x27; design and development service using a subscription or retainer model for billing (Stripe + Memberstack).
I primarily focus on WordPress and Webflow design and development as I realized long ago that there&#x27;s a huge demand for these services  in the design / marketing agency space.
I&#x27;ve had a lot of success the past year with this work, and surprisingly (or unsurprisingly) every single client of mine has been a larger agency needing additional help. That kind of makes sense because an agency can immediately see the value in what I offer without really having to be convinced.
Recently I&#x27;ve introduced a weekly option for clients looking to launch fast and spend less ($1,000 a week, maybe not sustainable but we’ll see). I&#x27;d love to get more involved with startups needing landing page work / design services.
There are a number of people doing stuff like this, but I do want to clarify that this is never going to be an &quot;unlimited design&quot; style subscription service. I&#x27;ve intentionally set a hard cap on the number of clients because it&#x27;s simply impossible to accommodate more than a certain number of clients while keeping the quality of work where it needs to be.
Anywho, curious what you all think and if you have any suggestions on how to improve.

          <p>The Chrome DevTools Animations tab is a powerful tool that helps you slow down, replay, adjust CSS animation timings, and see the results right away.


The Animations tab, while open, records animations automatically, conveniently groups them, and lets you:
Replay and slow down animations to better inspect them.
Adjust durations, timings, and delays by dragging points in a timeline instead of guessing and setting CSS values manually.
Additionally, you can edit the easing timings and set custom cubic-bezier curve values with the Easing Editor in the Elements &gt; Styles pane. To learn more, see Edit animation and transition timings with the Easing Editor.
For a more hands-on learning experience, follow the Inspect and modify CSS animation effects guide.</p>

          <p>Hello HN,
For fans of a more retro MacOS aesthetic, this is a custom style sheet I put together that restyles HN to look like the MacOS 8 desktop. Available in both user style sheet and browser extension formats.

I call it the &quot;publish directory&quot; but perhaps there&#x27;s a more popular term of art? ISPs tend to call it the www directory, or public_html, or htdocs, but I&#x27;m not convinced any of them is particularly well known to less technical peeps.

I believe this could give users not just a personal reader for themselves, but one that allows users to connect through comments and relational feeds. Ones that display feeds by what all users of an instance follow and feeds among multiple instances of this platform design.
How the main feed ranking works
Every user has their own personal subscription list of RSS feeds. Obviously by default they can view their own feeds like any old traditional reader. …</p>

          <p>Recently I was reading about fluid simulation and stumbled upon the Gauss Seidel method. I got interested in how it works and made a program that visualizes the method in action.
I had the idea of making an interactive book-like thing for a while, so took this as a chance to do just that.
Note that touch input doesn&#x27;t work and the layout is targeted towards bigger screens, so it doesn&#x27;t function properly on mobile.
It was fun to make and I wanted to share it. Maybe someone will find it useful. Corrections and feedback are welcome.
Technical Stuff
- A single 1.7MB HTML file with embedded JavaScript and WebAssembly. You can save this single file and double click it to run.
- A math typesetter from scratch in C that compiles/renders the equations in real-time (uses KaTex fonts and STB true type to rasterize the fonts).
- Platform code is done using Sokol (tested on windows and web).
- The UI is done using Dear ImGui (Most of the code is done in C++ to use ImGui without a wrapper except for the equations compiler).

          <p>Hi! Genie Builder is a free VSCode plugin that makes it easy to build web GUIs for Julia applications (and in future, Python apps too). Users can simply drag &amp; drop UI elements to create interactive dashboards and data apps, without writing any frontend code.
The tool is designed for data scientists and researchers who need to expose their data models to business users with an interactive web application, but lack the software development skills to build one.
Genie Builder completely eliminates the need to learn frontend development to code the UI. And very soon, we’re also going to support one-click cloud deployments to make it easy to build AND deploy data apps - no frontend nor devops skills required.
I’m Adrian, the creator of the open-source Genie web framework (https://genieframework.com/). Genie offers low-code libraries for building data applications - just like Streamlit or Dash, but for JuliaLang. We developed Genie Builder because of feedback from our open source community who needs more productive data tooling.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32353046 target="_blank">Ask HN: Why system design interviews are focused on services then components?</a>
          <p>So, recently i started giving out interviews. I have 7+ years of experience so one or two design rounds are expected. 
Keeping that in mind i revised my concepts on distributed system and read few famous papers on distributed system. it was fun visiting those concepts again.
Also, as advised i watched few scaling videos on youtube (i.e Design Uber etc.)
I have experience building system from scratch and depending upon the requirement i have scaled few services in my organization.
So, my expectations from the design round was to have open-ended discussion with interviewer on certain component and discussing drill-down component architecture, scaling issues, drawbacks etc.
But For me at least, reality is quite different. I was asked to design BookMyShow ( Movie booking system ) in full. I mean the interviewers expectation was to just draw the components, write the api and design schema. He will understand my work by looking into it.
I have given 5+ interviews as of now ( got offer from some of them). But i feel like design round wasn&#x27;t justified.

          <p>July 2022 was a bit of a country music song. A friend’s brother passed away while she was visiting, nearly everyone we know got COVID, took my broken guitar to get fixed by the guy that fixes Willie’s guitar, got a flat tire on the family car, the oil change on my pickup truck turned into thousands of dollars worth of repairs, and I lost my AirPods. Somehow, despite all that, July was a good month.
Escape to California

In mid-July we escaped the Texas heat and headed to gloomy sunny San Diego, California for my wife’s birthday. My wife grew up going to Mission Beach every summer, so upon marriage I inherited a family vacation to San Diego. We went every year until our son was three and then we were juggling small babies and the entire extended family couldn’t fit under one roof, so it fel…</p>

          <p>It sounds confusing, but the word ‘recyclable’ doesn’t always mean that something can, in fact, be recycled. Hopefully, by the time you get to the end of this episode, you’ll have a greater understanding of the complexities of the recycling system as a whole.</p>

          <a href=https://github.com/abishekmuthian/buttmoverWebApp target="_blank">Show HN: Butt Mover - A butt triggered productivity and health improvement game</a>
          <p>Productivity timers needed to be triggered manually before each task, Making it a chore by itself, Often leading to us not using them after a while and They don&#x27;t take health into consideration.
Health timers are intrusive, Even then they are not always accurate and They don&#x27;t take productivity into consideration.
Butt Mover addresses those problems by using a butt trigger for automatically starting the productivity timer when we sit on the chair before our workstation and a break timer which reminds us to take a walk automatically when we get up.
Butt Mover also incentivizes its usage through a Game. When the health(tasks/breaks) reaches zero its game over.
I&#x27;ve been iterating different forms of Butt Mover over past two years and released the web application earlier this year(After feedback from several HN users). Today I&#x27;m making the core application open-source as I&#x27;ve committed myself to make the Health &amp; Education applications I build open-source.
I hope you&#x27;d use Butt Mover for yourself and build Butt Trigger for others to improve productivity and health. Feedback and contributions to improve the project is appreciated.

          <a href=https://daveceddia.com/clean-up-merged-git-branches/ target="_blank">Delete Git Branches That Have Been Merged</a>
          <p>Got a lot of old git branches hanging around? Here’s a little script
that will delete the branches that have been marged.
It’ll print out the branches to be deleted, and then prompt for whether
you want to delete them.
If your top-level branch isn’t called “main”, customize the MAIN
variable to match.
Script: Delete old git branches
#!/bin/bash

# Change this to match the name of your top level branch
MAIN&#x3D;main

echo &quot;These branches have been merged into $MAIN and will be deleted:&quot;
echo
git branch --merged $MAIN | grep -v &quot;^\* $MAIN&quot;
echo

read -p &quot;Continue? [y/N] &quot; -n 1 -r
echo
if [[ ! $REPLY &#x3D;~ ^[Yy]$ ]]
then
  exit 1
fi

git branch --merged $MAIN | grep -v &quot;^\* $MAIN&quot; | xargs -n 1 -r git branch -d
Copy/paste this into a file in your repo or elsewhere (like
git-cleanup.sh) and make it executable with chmod +x git-cleanup.sh
Bonus: if you want this file to be ignored, but you don’t want to
clutter up the shared .gitignore file with your own local scripts, you
can edit .git/info/exclude and list this file there. That file works
as a local gitignore.

# Remove WebSQL in non-secure contexts
WebSQL in non-secure contexts is deprecated. The Web SQL Database standard was first proposed in April 2009 and abandoned in November 2010. Gecko never implemented this feature and WebKit deprecated it in 2019. The W3C encourages Web Storage and IndexedDb for those needing alternatives.
Developers should expect that WebSQL itself will be deprecated and removed when usage is low enough. For more information, see Deprecating Web SQL.

          <p>Who do you talk to when you have architectural questions? Where do you get feedback on design options? When you want to discuss tradeoffs of those options who do you talk that over with?
I am one of two technical cofounders for a small software company. We have really good discussions about the design of our product. I am pretty good at searching. We are comfortable weighing alternatives and making a decision and living with the consequences. All that said, sometimes I want to discuss with other people some of the design challenges we face, or seek input on how people have approached the problem.
Are there fora that you enjoy for such discussion? It seems that it does not fit with the theme of most Q&amp;A sites. Most IRC channels I know of are pretty focused on their own specific topic.

The good news is, you can train your brain to quickly evaluate the quality of informaiton. Not only can you quickly determine if someone knows what they are talking about but you can sort …

          <p>Last week I had the pleasure of attending and speaking at the first in-person meeting of the New York Web Performance meetup since the pandemic started. In my eyes this meetup, organized by Sergey Chernishev and now Mellisa Ada, is an institution, being the first ever Web Performance meetup in the world, and so it was a thrill to be back with the tribe, so to speak.

Talks
After Sergey did what Sergey does great  (give an intro to the meetup and its famous geekaways
list useful sites and resources, encourage mingling), I proceeded to do my version of an Old Man Yelling at the Internet and complain about some of the performance studies circulating out there that I think are doing more harm than good.

          <p>Research and testing make designs better. You might have seen this play out first hand, by running your own tests before iterating on concepts or working with user researchers to design a new feature.
You may have relied on user research to improve ease of use, reduce friction, and identify changes to include in your next design sprint. And that’s because user research leads to more efficient, informed design initiatives.
But we have a secret. Sometimes…research isn’t always necessary.
That doesn’t mean you should start going into every UX design project blindly, but there are times when you don’t need to dot every “i” and cross every “t”.
As always, prioritization is critical. You know you don’t have endless time to test your designs. You need to assess what needs to be tested right now, …</p>

          <p>Chrome 105 introduces two new methods on the NavigateEvent of the Navigation API (introduced in 102) to improve on methods that have proved problematic in practice. intercept(), which let&#x27;s developers control the state following the navigation, replaces transitionWhile(), which proved difficult to use. The scroll() method, which scrolls to an anchor specified in the URL, replaces restoreScroll() which does not work for all types of navigation.
In this article, I&#x27;ll explain the problems with both and how the new methods fix those problems.
# NavigateEvent.transitionWhile()
The NavigateEvent.trasitionWhile() method, introduced with the Navigation API in Chrome 102, intercepts navigation for client-side transitions in single page apps. Its first argument is a promise that signals to the brows…</p>

          <p>Container queries and :has() are a match made in responsive heaven. Luckily, both of these features are landing together in Chromium 105. This is a huge release with two highly-requested features for responsive interfaces!
# Container Queries: a quick summary
Container queries enable developers to query a parent selector for its size and styling information, making it possible for a child element to own its responsive styling logic, no matter where it lives on a web page.
Instead of relying on the viewport for styling input such as available space, developers now have the ability to query the size of in-page elements too. This capability means that a component owns its responsive styling logic. This makes the component much more resilient, as the styling logic is attached to it, no matter …</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/has-m105/ target="_blank">:has(): the family selector</a>
          <p>Since time began (In CSS terms), we&#x27;ve worked with a cascade in various senses. Our styles compose a &quot;Cascading Style Sheet&quot;. And our selectors cascade too. They can go sideways. In most cases they go downwards. But never upwards. For years, we&#x27;ve fantasized about a &quot;Parent selector&quot;. And now it&#x27;s finally coming! In the shape of a :has() pseudo selector.
The :has() CSS pseudo-class represents an element if any of the selectors passed as parameters match at least one element.
But, it&#x27;s more than a &quot;parent&quot; selector. That&#x27;s a nice way to market it. The not so appealing way might be the &quot;conditional environment&quot; selector. But that doesn&#x27;t have quite the same ring to it. How about the &quot;family&quot; selector?

I want to get away from creating tickets or sending emails highlighting UX concerns. This is cumbersome and not very transparent or collaborative.
Does a tool like this already exist?

          <p>I am looking for anything you do that helps you get stuff done, even stuff you are not passionate about. Although I&#x27;ve come across many useful tips here on HN, listed later, I still struggle. Some days I just can&#x27;t code at all. probably got sleep apnea.
Some stuff that has helped me on good days
- light cardio first thing or in noon
- good sleep
- not being stuck at some code
- deadlines not created by me (but leads to burn out)
- working closely with other people (PM, fellow dev)
- being in flow, hitting trifecta of skills match + interest match + support match
- air circulation and quiet environment, coldish temperature, multiple places to sit/lay
- informal culture and small team
- no ambiguity
- no bad blood between me and mgmt/boss/company/teammates
- create 3 todo item list daily
What else? what&#x27;s your morning routine?
I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s even about passion, I had all intentions and passion when I was working on my own project, but I worked 10 hours a day for a week and then never could work on it again, ended up selling it for few grand mostly to not see it rot.
TLDR: Extremely low stamina/energy and procrastination

You can now specify a crop area using region capture
when using getDisplayMedia() to capture the current tab.
Media query syntax can be written using
mathematical comparison operators.
Shared Element Transitions starts an

And there&#x27;s plenty more.
I&#x27;m Pete LePage. Let&#x27;s dive in and
see what&#x27;s new for developers in Chrome 104.
# Specify a crop area with region capture
getDisplayMedia() makes it possible to create a video stream from the current
tab. But, there are times when you don’t want the entire tab, only a small
portion of it. Until now, the only way to do that was to manually crop each
video frame.
With Region Capture, a web app can define the specific area of the screen it
wants to share. For example, Google Slides could allow you to stay i…</p>

          <p>We&#x27;re building an app that helps people manage their schedule, tasks and notes all in one place.
The goal is to create a workspace, where people can manage their various priorities, both personal and professional, see a single schedule combined of all their calendars and manage their days without switching between multiple apps.
At the moment we&#x27;ve implemented Google calendar synchronisation, basic tasks and notes. Also Emery has some things we really wanted to see in other apps – private notes for meetings, categories that can be used to group tasks/notes/meetings together, weekly productivity reports.
Happy to hear any feedback and answer any questions!

          <p>It seems obvious to me that something like RSS would make a great events publication format, and I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has already thought of this.
Say I would like to follow the events of my local art gallery and the local gigs of a certain musician. The gallery and musician could put out a feed which I could follow, with values including date-time, address, info-url, ticket-url, details. My event-feed reader would pull in the gallery&#x27;s and musician&#x27;s events from their website, and populate a calendar with them. Moreover, I could set the reader to only display events in the region I care about, so the only gigs of the musician that would appear would be the ones when they come to my town.
They seems a simple, decentralised way of following events, but I&#x27;m surprised nothing like this already exists?

          <p>Until now, the Async Clipboard API supported a limited set of
MIME types to be copied to and pasted from the system clipboard, specifically: text/plain,
text/html, and image/png. The browser typically sanitizes this to, for example, remove embedded
script elements or javascript: links from an HTML string, or to prevent PNG
decompression bomb attacks.
In some cases, though, it can be desirable to support unsanitized content on the clipboard:
Situations where the application deals with the sanitization itself.
Situations where it&#x27;s crucial for the copied data to be identical with the pasted data.
For such cases, the Async Clipboard API now supports web custom formats that let developers write
arbitrary data to the clipboard.

My design experience is all self-taught, starting off in the early days of basic HTML/CSS to customize my MySpace profile to learning graphic design through Youtube for a marketing internship.
Over time, I’ve taken on challenges like redesigning websites and apps, but learning informally has unf…</p>

          <p>In a digital world that clamors for clicks, news is sensationalized and “facts” change all the time. Here’s how to discern what is trustworthy and what is hogwash. *** Unless you’ve studied it, most of us are never taught how to evaluate science or how to parse the good from the bad. Yet it is …

          <p>Hi I can find easily courses books with technicalities of spark and technologies .
What I cannot find are good courses for designing meaning for choosing partition keys, folder structure, pipeline stages (do you want a cleanup phase and when not etc).
Here is a good random post I found https://www.google.com/amp/s/hub.packtpub.com/common-big-data-design-patterns/amp/
https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Typical-four-layered-big-data-architecture-ingestion-processing-storage-and_fig1_329368513
Is there something better than such random posts like books courses? All I find is courses that are either too low level with technicalities or top high levels.
Yeah I know there is the data intensive applications I read it and it&#x27;s not dealing with these specific design decisions its more of 40 k feel look.

          <a href=https://github.com/geoffsdavis/tape-measure target="_blank">Show HN: TapeMeasure – Swift class for creating segmented, labeled lines in UI</a>
          <p>TapeMeasure is a utility class, written in Swift, for generating a visual tape measure, or any other graphical elements that need layout in a measured sequence.
I created this class to help with a pet project I&#x27;m working on, where I needed to generate segmented, labeled lines to use as axes on charts and graphs. It occurred to me that this seems to be a pretty common task, involving a lot of boilerplate code and tedious calculations. Why not decouple the code and move it into a dedicated class? It&#x27;s self-contained, nice and simple, and easy to unit test.
It can also handle a lot of tweaks to the &quot;tape measure&quot;, such as boundary clipping and shifting offsets. It&#x27;s especially good for animation, where you can just change a parameter or two during animation, and call for the re-calculated data to re-render your measured line. That makes it great for animated sliding and scaling effects.
Anyway, enjoy!

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32276120 target="_blank">How we renamed our Design Converter to Magical Ass</a>
          <p>So here we go, our rebranding is done. New logo, new domain, what could go wrong.
We provide a tool to convert design files between Figma, XD, Sketch, Figma, PDF and more and have recently rebranded it from &quot;XD2Sketch&quot; to &quot;Magicul&quot;. We started out as a simple tool to allow users to import XD files in Sketch hence the name XD2Sketch but soon added more features. The name just didn&#x27;t make sense anymore. Magicul initially seemed to be a great name, but turned out to be a bit of an interesting pick when translated to French.
We&#x27;ve sent out a newsletter to our customers to let them know about the changes and here&#x27;s what one of our users replied:
Hey folks,
While I understand that you guys probably hope to operate primarily in English, I think it needs to be mentioned that your brand name &quot;Magicul&quot; in french, literally means &quot;Magical ass&quot;... but the real kicker is the .io of the domain, which literally means input &amp; output...
So here goes the bad news... The entire french community is reading your brand name - literally - as: Magical ass (dot) in &amp; out.
And then there&#x27;s the logo itself... which is a hole with a hat.
Christ. You can&#x27;t make this stuff up. This is ugh, umm, a brutally unfortunate brand?...lol
I&#x27;m in Quebec, Canada, where french is dominant and so I&#x27;m keenly aware of this - and so are my partners, colleagues and friends. We all had a good laugh.
Don&#x27;t know what else to say...?
Bonne chance mes amis!
Have a good one,
- A fan of your work in Montreal.

I just thought this was too hilarious to not share.

          <p>I was looking at the Guardian website to try and work out how they get LinkedIn to recognise the datestamp of shared articles, and look what I found.
Nice way of targetting adverts for web devs. I&#x27;m sure this has been done before but it&#x27;s a new one to me.

          <p>I’m not dying, but before I do I want to share with you — future generations of rockers — what I know about putting on a live music rock show.
The audience’s energy will match your energy. If you stand like a turd on the stage, they audience will stand like a bunch of turds. If you bob your head, they’ll bob their heads. If you move around, they’ll move around. If you show low confidence, they’ll have low confidence in you and start checking out.
Don’t let your band drama show on stage. Every band has drama, but don’t let it show on stage. The audience isn’t there for that.
Practice setting up and tearing down efficiently. Don’t make the audience wait and don’t be “that guy” who drags out setup extra long as some weirdo passive-aggressive attention seeking move. See previous rule.
No matter how big the stage, setup as close to each other as possible. Look and feel like a combined unit of people making music. Trust me, it will be more impressive.
The bassist and the drummer should stand next to each other. It’s all about the bass guitar and the kick drum locking in together.
Never leave the van unattended during load-in or load-out. If you haven’t had your gear stolen at this point, it’s a miracle.
Lead guitar gets the attention, but the bass guitar brings the sex. Flashy medleys get attention, but people feel the bass, no matter how boring.
Don’t riff stage banter. It’s hard to be witty on the fly unless you are very, very witty. Have some prepared goofs or smalltalk.
Make friends with the soundboard operator. This person ultimately controls how good you sound and can make or break you.
“Come forward to the stage” is at best a one-time suggestion. You can’t control people, never ask more than once.</p>

          <p>Blogging. The quintessential starter project for most—if not all—site generators. Here’s a few samples:
Next.js guides new developers to Learn Next.js “by creating a very simple blog app.”
Gatsby’s tutorial guides folks to create their “first Gatsby site: a blog site…”
Remix’s home page has a prominent Get Started call to action button that links to their Blog Tutorial.
Given that Markdown is a very popular document format for blogging, this gives us the opportunity to compare the performance of different site generators for this pervasive use case (highlighted on each generator’s documentation, as noted above).
Let’s see how each generator stacks up when consuming markdown files from the local project’s file system and building into a production-ready project.

          <p>At the beginning of the pandemic, Joe McCann wrote a speculative future piece called The New, New World Order (use a private tab if Medium paywalls you). Predicting the future or forecasting trends is never exact work, but Joe made some thought-provoking claims even if everything doesn’t pan out as predicted.
My favorite claim —and the one I still think about today— was the one about Cloud-work vs. Land-work. Dividing the labor force based on whether you work on the cloud or you work on the land is some sci-fi shit. A new dichotomy for a new era. I can already imagine cloud workers wearing silver jumpsuits and land workers wearing beige jumpsuits.

Jokes aside, I find Cloud-work vs. Land-work an innovative way to frame job types. It breaks away from the tired “blue collar” and “white colla…</p>

          <p>Olivia Hoskin
      Writer &amp; Design Enthusiast 

Muted colors in design can help your audiences enjoy a new peace of mind that emanates from low saturation or chroma — just like the color palettes in this collection.
Quite literally the “opposite of saturated” these designs are subtly elegant. As vivid colors of our past are slowly replaced with harmonious combinations of green, orange, beige, and other shades of “calm” we can enjoy feelings of safety, familiarity, and nurture.
Muted color palettes bring a modern and genuine look and feel to any design project. Perfect for a conscious product or brand, muted colors can be added to anything from packaging to illustrations, to logo color schemes.

          <p>Here’s a tiny CSS tip for making staggered animations feel waaaay more natural: Negative animation delay. I’ve seen this idea shared by master CSS animators Jhey and Amit on separate occasions, and it’s such a neat little trick that it’s worth recording here!
Let’s say we have a group of elements, and we want them to animate in turn on a loop — such as this wavy text example. We’re calculating the animation-delay value them using a custom property corresponding to the element’s index.

          <p>The Console API allows you to log various messages to the Console from your JavaScript. The Console, in turn, has various useful display options. Watch the following video to learn all the skills.


With the Console API, you can:
Log, filter, and group the messages.
Interact with the current page.
Log variables.
Log and display object in various formats: tables, HTML elements, JSON objects.
Count function calls.
Display stack traces.
Measure the time elapsed between two points in code.
For a more hands-on learning experience, follow the Log messages in the Console interactive tutorial.
For a comprehensive list of all the Console API methods, see the Console API reference.</p>

          <p>I&#x27;m still quite early in my career, only at my second SW Dev job. My previous position was a monolith app with arguably poor design resulting in large parts of the app being very tightly coupled when they shouldn&#x27;t be. Obviously this make testing some parts of the app very difficult  and of course those were the critical parts of them app (our integration test suite took over 24 hours to run at one point).
When I joined my current company they were in the process of breaking down their monolith into micro services which based on my work at my previous position seemed like a much better alternative. After some time here I feel like I&#x27;m unsure whether or not micro services are as amazing as they need to be but I&#x27;m currently chalking it up to my inexperience with them. It seems like there needs to be a balance of making sure that each service has a limited responsibility while also not having services too interdependent.
So basically I would like to learn more about good design practices and pitfalls to avoid. What resources have you guys used to learn more about micro services?

          <p>I discovered RSS a few days back and have been searching around for good blogs to fill my feed. 
I found a few great blogs here on HN:
[1] https://alien.slackbook.org/blog/
[2] https://acoup.blog/
[3] https://scholars-stage.org/
Are there any other active blogs that fill this template of long and deep discussions on a particular topic by an individual?
I&#x27;m particularly interested in books, philosophy and electronics blogs though any topic will do as long as it&#x27;s not deep level programming.
It doesn&#x27;t necessarily need to have an RSS feed because I&#x27;ll try some workarounds if it is interesting enough.
Though not particularly related, old-style one-man informative sites (and not blogs) are also welcome.

          <p>This summer marks the summer my kids got online. I gave them “the talk” and set down some ground rules.
Never send a photo of yourself to a stranger.
What you say online is the same as saying it in person. If you’re a mean person online, it’s the same as being mean in person.
No spamming. Conversations are a back and forth.
It’s okay to leave the chatroom if you’re uncomfortable.
Hopefully this sets a good foundation for “being online”. It’s earlier than we planned, but with friends’ travel schedules, COVID quarantines, and Texas heat advisories; parent-initiated Zooms and FaceTimes weren’t scaling. We’re now letting the kids self-govern their online hangouts through FaceTime and Messenger Kids. We’ve been conservative about what our kids can do with their devices (time limits, age/content restrictions, parent approval to download/buy, no open chat, etc) and some of those levers will stay in place, but it’s the beginning of a new era.
There’s already been some timezone-related 5:00 AM calls made, but hopefully with a bit more nudging around social norms this goes well.</p>
