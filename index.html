          <p>Hey HN!
I am looking for a single productivity tool that can do everything I want without having to use gdocs, Microsoft etc.
Can anyone refer such a tool?

          <p>Hi HN, I am in the market for a new monitor and would like to ask you guys for some recommendations.
My requirements are:
- Good for frontend work. High DPI, high resolution. Not excessively blurry, or retina-like. Good color representation.
- Single monitor setup.
- Be able to see 3 screens side by side comfortably, with my coding screen at minimum 16px font size
- Around 1-1.5k.
- Can be driven by a Macbook Pro
I am currently comparing a Dell 43&quot; 4K Ultrasharp screen (dell u4323qe)  vs a LG 40&quot; Ultrawide 5kx2k (lg 40wp95c-w). I don&#x27;t have any experience using an ultrawide vs a very large screen so feedback around that decision (or recommendations of other monitors) would be very useful.

          <p>Back in May I had the privilege of speaking at Beyond Tellerand, an incredible conference in Düsseldorf, Germany, with content extending way beyond web design into the realms of animation, mural painting, typography, digital art, Japanese calligraphy and more!
My own talk was on CSS layout, including some of the exciting new features we have at our disposal. If you want to get up to speed on what’s new in CSS layout, this is a good place to start.

          <p>Since 2016 I’ve used, created and contributed to multiple design systems.
I’ve seen what works and what doesn’t. By “doesn’t” I mean designers don’t trust it. And as a result they don’t use it.
When I’m feeling sassy, I call these people ‘cowboy designers’.
Now there are some designers that will ignore your design system no matter how good it is.
These people are true cowboys and they wear the hats 🤠. But most designers would prefer to use tried and tested patterns. As long as they can trust them.
And I’ve found that there are 5 key elements a design system needs to have in order to make it so good that designers choose it over doing their own thing.
Here they are:
Key element #1: research findings and rationale
Designers need to know they can trust a pattern.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;36629522 target="_blank">Ask HN: How do you do version control during hardware-software co-design?</a>
          <p>How do folks develop PCBs, firmware, host-software, maybe even ASICs and track versions of each? Can these various components be effectively tracked in a single repository? Specifically:
The timelines for design cycles vary greatly – it can range from mere minutes for host software changes, builds, and tests, to hours for FPGA synthesis, and days to weeks for PCBs. ASIC development can span months to years.
Artifacts: in software we have mostly text (we can diff), we can build quickly or cache builds or run incremental builds; none of that works in the physical world. Is it advisable to check in a mechanical or electrical engineering design project into a git repository?
What do folks do, what is your experience, what works, what does not?

          <p>I&#x27;ve realized over time that one thing I prefer about a Twitter-like chronological feed compared to any RSS app I&#x27;ve ever used is that I don&#x27;t feel like I have to catch up or get to &quot;inbox zero&quot; or whatever; when the app loads, the most recent stuff is up top, and older stuff falls away without me having to do anything (i.e. &quot;mark as read&quot;).
Is there an RSS reader that provides this experience?

          <p>Hi,
I am working on a MVP iOS and Android app and would like to get early version out in about 10 days from now. This is to get it hands of potential users in 3 weeks from now.
I haven’t built UI stuff before so I am bit concerned of initial UX and how it will impact my early adopters..
Any suggestions / resources to follow some basic guidelines so that it’s not too shabby UX wise would be greatly helpful

          <p>“Electronic products these days are based on chips with hundreds of connectors. Connecting them can involve hundreds of wires. A PC board is an inexpensive way to connect all the wires at once. When Steve Jobs and I started, with a blue box and then the Apple I and Apple II computers, I did the digital design, connecting hundreds of wires myself on the prototypes. Steve Jobs took the role of getting PC boards made so that we could manufacture sellable products.
After a short while we had outside companies create the PC boards according to my designs. I was extremely proud of one design that far exceeded what had been done before. That was a floppy disk interface card so you could attach a disk and type “Run Checkbook” to run the Checkbook program, rather than finding a cassette tape labele…</p>

          <p>With Twitter on it&#x27;s MySpace trajectory, I have started to see more and more Mastodon posts (whose ideology I support with much fan fare) but honestly I think that it won&#x27;t see much adoption outside of niche groups and techies just because of it&#x27;s ugly UI. The Achilles heel of open source projects...
Sample size is low, but everyone whom I ask outside of my tech circle says that they prefer Twitter&#x27;s UI because Mastodon looks kinda clunky or just ugly. And seems like some Mastodon users also agree[1]. As such, I wanted to see what the sentiment on HN is, that is, do you like Mastodon&#x27;s UI?

That’s what Froala can provide you — […]

        <div>
          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;36593583 target="_blank">Ask HN: How do you display HTML tables on any screen size?</a>
          <p>For the longest time I hated how I could not easily make HTML tables that are showing nice excel like data (i.e. they are really correctly using table, tr, and td tags for data not layout) to look good on mobile.
I finally have a solution I love. I keep using it over and over.
headers :&#x3D; []string{&quot;name&quot;, &quot;age&quot;, &quot;species&quot;, &quot;home_planet&quot;, &quot;language&quot;, &quot;occupation&quot;}
I define the headers and call:
c.MakeCells(list, headers, &quot;_welcome&quot;)
The list is an array of key values pairs, and _welcome is just the name of the view.
{{ define &quot;_welcome_col1&quot; }}
{{ $row :&#x3D; index . &quot;row&quot; }}
{{ index $row &quot;name&quot; }}
{{ end }}
{{ define &quot;_welcome_col2&quot; }}
{{ $row :&#x3D; index . &quot;row&quot; }}
{{ index $row &quot;age&quot; }}
{{ end }}
etc.
Then with tailwindcss I have:

    {{ template &quot;_table_large&quot; . }}


    {{ template &quot;_table_small&quot; . }}

So I&#x27;m rendering both the tables on the page but only 1 will show depending on the size of the screen.
And the logic in _table_small is the secret to the whole thing. Instead of displaying each row horizontally, it repeats the headers vertically as col1 and then col2 is each row value.
You can see demo at https://many.pw/
Just make the window smaller if you are on desktop and it will jump to the small version.

          <p>Hey,
it’s been a while again since my last edition. Spring and summer here are always a busy season for me, splitting my available time into two jobs: Web work (or currently project management) and my garden. I’ll try to catch up more regularly now again, so maybe another edition will follow soon.
I’m learning to value my market garden nursery more and more. It forces me to be in a passive, listening and watching mode, and only interfere if I have a proper plan to make an impact. When you do things improperly, you may end up having twice the work. Or even worse, your plants suffer and you get less crop.
With software development it’s often very similar. We can push forwards and run behind latest trends and technologies but without a proper plan, you end up having these endless projects. Be…</p>

          <p>After my wrangle with getting a timezone from an IP address by reducing large databases down from several hundred megabytes down to only a few, then discovering IPv6 didn&#x27;t work (so I then applied my same logic to get 700MB to 10MB), the ever lovely Phil Hawksworth pointed out that (of course) Netlify has this data available in their edge functions.
I totally overlooked the feature (maybe I didn&#x27;t even look!). So let&#x27;s implement that and then discover the glaring bug in all of the code so far.

Netlify edge function&#x27;s geo prop
Phil kindly sent me a direct message on Space Karen&#x27;s website pointing me to the geo property provided in edge function calls.
This (of course 🤦‍♂️) means the code for the function is (for me) stupid simple:

          <p>There’s a high-end grocer in a very expensive neighborhood of New York–and they focus all of their energy on Italian food. Everything is imported, and they spend a lot of time and money earning the premium they charge for an authentic Italian shopping experience. And then a lazy brand manager decided to plaster “Sale-A-Bration” signs […]</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;36559258 target="_blank">Ask HN: Could an oxygen concentrator increase my productivity?</a>
          <p>Has anyone here tried using an oxygen concentrator to increase their productivity?  I can get the CO2 level in my room to around 580 with a comfortable temperature, but I never feel quite as clear-headed as when I&#x27;m working outside.  I&#x27;m wondering if getting an oxygen concentrator that gets my effective CO2 level to ~400 would carry any risks or downsides that I should know about. For example, one thing I&#x27;m learning is that these machines can be loud, so I&#x27;d need to consider whether the productivity gain from increased oxygen would be offset by increased ambient noise.
Update: Here are a list of things I think I&#x27;ll try based on comments: 1. oxygen cylinder, 2. CO2 scrubber, 3. oxygen concentrator, 4. air exchanger.

          <p>Picture this.
You’re designing a form but the questions are complicated. Users need a lot of guidance to understand each question. But this makes the page long and messy.
You run through various patterns.
‘Tooltips!’, you say to yourself.
And that’s cool because tooltips keep things clean while allowing users to access extra information. You polish the designs, get them ready for dev and you go to bed happy.
At least until you do some usability testing.
Now picture this.

Seems like on mobile browser it doesnt keep to the viewport anymore so you have to horizontally scroll. I see it both on mobile Firefox and chrome. Increasing font size in the accessibility settings makes no difference either.

          <p>The legacy getStats() WebRTC API will be removed in Chrome 117, therefore apps using it will need to migrate to the standard API. This article explains how to migrate your code, and what to do if you need more time to make this change.
Historically there have been two competing versions of the WebRTC getStats() API. The legacy getStats() API, that pre-dates the standardization process and takes a callback argument, and the standardized and widely supported API which returns a promise.
The standard API is more feature rich and has well-defined metrics publicly documented in the W3C specification Identifiers for WebRTC&#x27;s Statistics API. The specification includes descriptions of each metric listed in this guide and many more.
From Chrome 117 the legacy getStats() API will throw an exception …</p>

I&#x27;m sharing a project I&#x27;ve been working on: a browser-based code editor with a chat UI and autocompletion feature similar to GitHub Copilot. It&#x27;s entirely open-source and MIT licensed.
Feel free to give it a try at https://www.lmed.io/ and view the code repository at https://github.com/jongomez/lmed
Looking forward to your thoughts and feedback.

          <p>This week I decided it was time to try to revive some of the casualties from my recent Vercel incident, and though webmentions.app is the more useful, I though I&#x27;d start with the, so I thought, low hanging fruit - &quot;how many days to Christmas&quot;.
It turned into 3 days of complicated problem solving and working against systems that just didn&#x27;t want to work the way I needed.

The context
I have a little app that runs on a internet connected clock that shows the days to Christmas. A little while ago, during December and Jan, the traffic (along with traffic on webmentions.app) spiked hard enough to cause Vercel to block my entire account.
So for the short term, I disabled the countdown app. Christmas, at the time, was a full year away, so I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be missed.

          <p>Hey Hackers!
Since I first needed to style an HTML element with multiple borders, I wondered how great it would be if there were an online tool to help design CSS multiple borders without writing any code. I have recently searched for a tool like that, but haven’t found any. So, I decided to create Bordiple.
Bordiple is a CSS Multiple Borders generator tool. It allows coders and no-coders to create beautiful borders and share the result with any person using a custom link.
Every feedback will be very welcome. I hope you all enjoy it!

          <a href=https://serif.so/dumbduck target="_blank">Show HN: Build fast by writing placeholder UI in DumbDuck components (see cmnts)</a>
          <p>This is something I&#x27;ve been working on for a while. I&#x27;ve previously shared a video showing the designing and code exporting process of my web/mobile design tool[0]. I still felt at that point that there was a huge disconnect between development and design. I think I&#x27;ve solved that with these special components that allow:
- developers to build their logic using zero effort, placeholder UI
- designers to redesign these UI&#x27;s while testing their work in its final form, in the full context of the application
- developers to accept these ready-to-go designs in a way that doesn&#x27;t clutter the codebase
I oscillate between feeling ecstatic, because I feel like I&#x27;m on the edge of finally solving the back and forth handoff problem I&#x27;ve often dealt with, and some light despair, because I have a very small network (no decision makers) and would struggle to get something even perfect off the ground. I&#x27;m only saying this so someone reading is encouraged to either A) let me know that this is something they want or B) bring me back to reality, and explain why I&#x27;m wasting my time.
Cheers!

          <p>As a UX designer, your primary goal is to create seamless and user-friendly experiences. However, there’s one huge mistake that could cost you your job: listening only to your client.
No, wait, hear us out…
There is no denying that delivering what your client wants is important, as is client satisfaction. However, it’s crucial that you, as the UX designer, prioritize the needs and preferences of the end-users throughout the entire design process.
With an eye (and ear) only on your client’s direction, you can only be driven in one direction, the client’s vision. With a consistent eye on your user as well as an understanding of your client’s needs and purpose, you can act as a bridge between the client and end user.
In this blog post, we’ll explore how to avoid only listening to your client …</p>

          <p>Hey folks,
I&#x27;m super excited to announce the release of a new UI for Apache Kafka, Confluent, Redpanda and Kinesis that focuses on Teams and Data Mesh. (Note: the desktop version is also very popular with individual developers!)
Why is this important? Because providing a solution that can be used by both IT and business (non-technical) users is essential when building applications that process business data.
Of course, we are mainly developers working on Kadeck. So you won&#x27;t miss any of the features you need to troubleshoot and monitor Kafka and your applications. In fact, we have put a lot of effort into making Kadeck the best UI for Apache Kafka on the market. This includes enterprise features such as fine-grained rights management, topic organisation with data owners, labels and topic (API) documentation, teams and roles as well as LDAP/AD connectivity, data policies and masking, audit log and much more.
I hope you enjoy using Kadeck - either the free version or the Professional/Enterprise version - and please let me know your feedback. I always love to hear about your specific use case!
Have a great day,
Ben

          <p>Hey HN,
Constantly toggling viewport sizes the other day finally tipped my personal annoyance/action threshold.
The result is WINDED - a simple tool to help you simultaneously view how your website appears on different screen sizes without needing to constantly adjust the size of your browser window.
With a 4K monitor, you can see every Tailwind breakpoint on a single screen! This is game-changing.
Please let me know what you think!

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;36479864 target="_blank">Ask HN: Who’s Working on the “HTML” for VR?</a>
          <p>I’m not talking about a canvas tag with some WebXR/WebGPU/WebGL. I’m talking about VR having it’s ‘world-wide web’ moment instead of headsets being expensive, digital walled gardens. Seems to me that VR headsets have eaten themselves already. For example, A common criticism of Apple Vision Pro is “What problem does this solve? What is the killer app?”. Before the world-wide web, I believe the home personal computer was primarily used for games, similar to VR right now.
Actual HTML is a poor fit for this solution. Our ‘document’ metaphor doesn’t really translate so well to virtual space unless we’re doing work designed for the space (like spreadsheets or code). In such a case, floating windows may be appropriate to replace modern desktops. Otherwise, I think we need a protocol and language of some kind to serve and describe virtual space, either from the headsets or larger infrastructure.
Is anyone working something like this?

how well you know a prog lang
Xhow concise or powerful that prog lang
Xhow well you know the editor/toolchain
Xhow powerful your machine
Xhow much/little interrupted
Xhow much/little distracted
Xhow many relevant &quot;variables&quot; &amp; constraint factors are fresh in your brain&#x27;s registers/caches

          <p>Manipulating data is core to any programming language. JavaScript is no exception, especially as JSON has token over as a prime data delivery format. One such data manipulation is reversing arrays. You may want to reverse an array to show most recent transactions, or simple alphabetic sorting. Reversing arrays with JavaScript originally was done via […]

          <p>If you&#x27;ve ever played a full screen web game that popped up an in-game dialog
that you instinctively canceled with the Escape key, you probably found
yourself kicked out of full screen mode.
This frustrating experience is caused by the fact that dialog and full screen
mode &quot;fight&quot; for the Escape key. It&#x27;s an unequal battle because, by default,
full screen mode always wins. But how can you make the dialog the winner for the
Escape key? This is where the Keyboard Lock
API comes into play.

          <p>I&#x27;m currently a SWE working at FAANGMULA, feeling a bit burnt out and exploring other paths within tech. I&#x27;ve been paying much more attention to the design space in tech and have become enamored with the idea of learning how to create similarly beautiful experiences. I&#x27;ve been particularly inspired by Andrew Wilkinson/Metalab, Brian Chesky/AirBNB, Apple, Any Distance, Flighty, etc. As I pay more attention to high quality design and UX, I&#x27;m realizing that outstanding design in and of itself can be enough to launch successful and beautiful software.
I&#x27;ve been searching for high quality online education to study design in a more formal and rigorous manner, something equivalent to the MIT challenge, but all I&#x27;ve found are RISD&#x27;s online certificates which cost $10k, or youtuber/twitter influencer courses. I&#x27;m willing to pay the 10 grand for those courses, but if I&#x27;m going to spend that much I&#x27;d like some validation that its really worth it.
Primarily though, I&#x27;d love to hear from any designers here about how you learned and honed your craft.

          <a href=https://adamsilver.io/blog/the-problem-with-input-masks-and-what-to-do-instead/ target="_blank">The problem with input masks and what to do instead</a>
          <p>In 2010 I discovered input masks.
They seemed like a smart way to prevent errors. Because they help users follow a format. And they do so without taking up space.
But the truth is that this fancy pattern degrades UX.
Here’s why:
Problem #1: They’re confusing
For example, the cursor advances automatically to the next position. And placeholder characters can’t be deleted.

				
			Telephone input mask replacing characters and advancing to the next position automatically
	

Problem #2: They may be mistaken for an actual answer
This is because the mask looks like an input causing using to submit the form with errors.
Input masks make the input look like it’s been answered
	

Problem #3: They make the interface feel broken
This is because typing a restricted character gets ignored.

				
			Restricted characters get ignored without giving users any feedback
	

Problem #4: The format may be unfamiliar
For example, a phone number may require a country code which isn’t always expected and makes users work harder.
Input masks may use unfamiliar formats that don’t make sense to everyone
	

Problem #5: They’re misleading and verbose in screen readers
For example, they announce placeholder characters which aren’t part of the answer. And they don’t announce characters that were typed but ignored.

				
			Voiceover announces placeholder characters. And fails to announce characters that were typed but ignored.
	

What to do instead
Leave the input empty to make it obvious where the answer goes
Let users type what they like so the interface doesn’t feel unresponsive and broken
Allow multiple formats so users don’t have to fix something unnecessarily
Allow users to check their answers either on a separate page or just below the field</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;36440741 target="_blank">Ask HN: Why most/all client HTML routers suck in iOS for swipe-back navigation</a>
          <p>Most of the frameworks I used (svelte-kit/remix/nextjs) in IOS when navigating backwards either don&#x27;t show the previous page (especially if it was scrolled) or lose scroll position. (sometimes they work but not on every visit, some race condition or like exists)
Without a client router with native navigation, everything looks fine.

          <p>CNBC has a glaring CSS problem on certain viewports that produces no left-hand margin on their articles on my phone.
Example link: https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/21/intel-stock-drops-6percent-as-company-updates-chip-manufacturing-plans.html
I doubt most people with iOS would notice this, as I think it only affects certain resolutions.
It seems it might have something to do with the footer.
Hopefully they fix it.
It is annoying.

          <p>Humility, a designer’s essential value—that has a nice ring to it. What about humility, an office manager’s essential value? Or a dentist’s? Or a librarian’s? They all sound great. When humility is our guiding light, the path is always open for fulfillment, evolution, connection, and engagement. In this chapter, we’re going to talk about why.
That said, this is a book for designers, and to that end, I’d like to start with a story—well, a journey, really. It’s a personal one, and I’m going to make myself a bit vulnerable along the way. I call it:
The Tale of Justin’s Preposterous Pate

The wgslLanguageFeatures member of the GPU object lists the names of supported WGSL language extensions. Supported WGSL language extensions are automatically enabled, therefore you don’t need to explicitly request one. This list is currently empty but you can expect plenty of them in the future (for example, do-while loops). See issue dawn:1777.

  // Use unknown-feature in WGSL shader code.

# Unset vertex buffer
Passing null rather than a GPUBuffer to setVertexBuffer() on GPURenderPassEncoder or GPURenderBundleEncoder allows you to unset a previously set vertex buffer in a given slot. See issue dawn:1675.

          <p>I was honored to speak alongside Justin Fagnani (Lit), Kristofer Joseph (Begin, Enhance.dev), and Rob Eisenberg about the current state of the Web Components ecosystem.
We talked a bit about the controversial is attribute, how we’re all excited about upcoming Declarative Custom Element definitions, the long term benefits of staying close to the platform, but somehow didn’t touch on adding JSX to the platform (disappointing I know).

          <p>I’ve previously written about the problems with regular sticky menus.
In response to those issues, some people suggest showing and hiding the menu as the user scrolls up and down.

				
			Bondir’s sticky menu appears and disappears as the user scrolls
	

This seems smart because:
the menu gets out of the way to allow users to focus on the content
it allows users to access the menu without having to scroll back to the top
But this approach is worse than regular sticky menus.
Here’s why:
Problem #1: They’re distracting
This is because as the user scrolls the content to fit in the viewport, the menu will suddenly appear.
Good design doesn’t guess (wrongly) about what users need.
Problem #2: They’re hard to control
This is because scrolling up too much reveals the menu when it’s not wanted. And scrolling down a bit by accident will hide it when it is wanted.
Good design doesn’t take control away.
Problem #3: They cause dizziness and nausea
This is because animation can cause dizziness, nausea, headaches and more.
Good design avoids physical stress.
Problem #4: They can impact performance
This is because JavaScript is needed to react to the scroll event which can drain the battery and degrade performance especially on low-powered devices.
Good design is lightweight.
What to do instead
Keep pages short: Sticky menus are a symptom of long pages so fix the root cause.
Just let users scroll: It’s a myth that scrolling is a problem. Even on mobile, the top of the page is a flick or 2 away mostly.
Put relevant links in context: For example, add a subscribe form to the end of a post or add a CTA to a pricing section.
Use a back-to-top link: They’re relatively unobtrusive (but only do this once you exhaust the other options).</p>

          <p>I don&#x27;t even know where to start with this, but the UI/UX of Amazon Music is so incomprehensibly bad it&#x27;s hard to believe it wasn&#x27;t put together by first year interns. We&#x27;re led to believe that FAANG hires the best of the best minds but it&#x27;s increasingly obvious this can&#x27;t be the case anymore. A short list of my experiences:
* Infinite scroll is broken in the desktop browser. I can&#x27;t access songs in my library beyond the letter A. Why infinite scroll is needed here or anywhere for that matter is an entire discussion unto itself.
* Random music I&#x27;ve purchased is unavailable for streaming and has been reassigned to &quot;shuffle with other songs&quot; as I don&#x27;t subscribe to unlimited. I can still download the songs and listen to them locally however. To put it another way, some stuff I&#x27;ve purchased looks like I haven&#x27;t, perhaps in an attempt to get me to repurchase it.
* Accessing a 30 second sample of a song is hidden behind a mess of dark patterns. Scrolling in this UI is broken as well with overlapping layers hiding text and graphics. In fact the whole purchasing of music has been deliberately obfuscated likely to encourage streaming.
* Searching for music within your own library is nearly impossible.
I could go on and on about this but my experiences have been so bad I&#x27;m left speechless as to how this made it to production. As a highly experienced technical user I can&#x27;t help but feel how the average consumer forced to interact with this garbage feels.

          <p>Hi HN, this is a platform (Discuit, pronounced &quot;diskette&quot;) I&#x27;ve been working on for about two years. I initially built it for a niche demographic (my native country). But now with Reddit going dark and people looking for a new place to migrate to, I&#x27;m doing a quick launch today.
A few quick things:
1. I don&#x27;t believe federated platforms will ever become mainstream. They have a whole host of problems, not the least of which is that they&#x27;re too complicated for most people to use. This platform is not, therefore, federated.
2. I don&#x27;t know what the best way of monetizing a thing like this is. I see only two options: the Wikipedia model of running on donations, or being advertising supported (along with a paid ad-free tier). The Wikipedia model works quite well for small-scale and bandwidth li…</p>

          <p>Hey hacker news
I&#x27;m the founder and lead developer at Opine.cm, and we&#x27;ve just rolled out a new feature that hopefully will reduce the number iterations in your design or web-dev projects.
I&#x27;ve always been a big fan of checklists. When checklists were introduced to hospitals prior to surgeries, the number of complications and deaths dropped by 35%. I use them a lot personally - but I know many designers and devs find it too much effort.
The reality is, we easily forget verbal feedback; the humble to-do list solves this. We&#x27;ve just taken the added step of using AI to turn any video feedback that you get into a to-do list.
To try it for yourself
- Create an account at https://Opine.cm
- Record some feedback on the design examples
- Watch as the AI creates your to-do list.
Or here&#x27;s a demo
https://www.loom.com/share/e7a6ccd0df0b4dfb8552bd08c7c8ab56
(Quick note - The demo shows design work - but you can add also add websites in Opine.)

          <p>Through the little Etsy store I&#x27;ve got, I offer Game Boy game repair mostly just so I get to &quot;play&quot; on different problems, and a different problem did arrive.
This Game Boy Advance game, although worked, requires a battery for the real time clock aspects of the game (i.e. timed events). The problem was that there was a repair attempt that had taken off the entire pad for the battery, and in fact had go through the pad, through the silk screen and had gone all the way into the fibre glass insulation layer (you might be able to see in the photo the woven pattern).
Before slapping a battery on and jumping the positive leg to the right component, I wanted to check that nothing else was missing. Thankfully the community have tried to preserve a lot of the history (in this case, the PCB traces) but also published it freely on the web.
From this I also found a resistor had been lost in the previous repair. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s clear from my photo, but what I did was to bond the missing resistor in a completely different location (before it traces to a capacitor) and then use a jumper wire from the replaceable battery case. This was mostly in case the battery case was torn off again it wouldn&#x27;t cause damage to the components on the board.
Once that was all done, the game happily had its clock and was returned to it&#x27;s owner the same day.</p>

          <a href=https://www.visoid.com/ target="_blank">Show HN: Iterative architectural design using generative AI</a>
          <p>Hi everyone,
I&#x27;m Joachim, and together with my co-founder, we&#x27;re building Visoid - a tool for rendering architectural designs in an iterative manner.  We firmly believe that the future of this type of rendering, especially during the ideation stage of a project, will be heavily reliant on generative AI.
Traditionally, you would send your designs to a professional and potentially wait several days for the renders to be ready, all the while going back and forth with consultations. With Visoid, you can now receive instant, beautiful renders at a fraction of the cost.
Our platform is designed for architects and rendering professionals who work with visualizations of architectural designs. Visoid enables our users to iteratively modify the scene, materials, and elements in a sketch, 3D model or similar, controlled with a simple prompt.
We&#x27;re still in the early stages, and while the output isn&#x27;t always perfect, we&#x27;ve made significant strides in improving the quality and the control of the output images. We&#x27;re confident that it&#x27;s only a matter of time before we can consistently deliver higher quality images and with even more control.
We&#x27;re still figuring out how to fit this product into the workflow of our users and would love to get your feedback. I will try to answer any questions you have.
For more example images, have a look at our Instagram

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;36346043 target="_blank">Ask HN: How do you focus on productivity when working on the computer?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;m curious what methods people here use to avoid distractions when working on a computer. Obviously computers are excellent tools, but simply having access to an internet browser can be a gateway to a massive time sink.
Some things I have tried:
- Set up a Pi-Hole with distracting websites on the blacklist so the DNS requests do not resolve. I disabled this to dork around on the web today, so clearly not an effective commitment device.
- &quot;Cold Turkey Writer&quot; which locks down your PC giving only a text box essentially, until you write X words. I didn&#x27;t find this useful for my writing style since I tend to look up additional references/sources as I write, and losing access to that hurt my flow.
- Using a Raspberry Pi 4B as my desktop PC, with the idea being I couldn&#x27;t play games and YouTube isn&#x27;t entertaining when 30% of the frames are dropping. I ended up wasting a bunch of time messing with Linux trying to get stuff to work (oh Obsidian needs to be compiled and installed for ARM, oh there&#x27;s no Google Drive installer for Linux, let&#x27;s set up rclone, oh the audio driver broke). It was cool to have a fanless, low-power PC but I went back to my Windows desktop out of frustration and desire to have things &quot;just work&quot;.
Is it futile to use hardware/software to try and fix a self-discipline issue? What works for you?

announced the Topics
API, a proposal for interest-based advertising. Topics is designed to enable websites to serve
relevant ads in a privacy-preserving manner, without resorting to covert tracking techniques, like
browser fingerprinting. Topics utilizes several techniques to preserve user privacy, including
reducing data, noising data, excluding potentially sensitive topics, and processing data on-device.
Combined, these changes make Topics a significant step forward
for user privacy compared to third-party cookies.
When we first offered Topics, we were clear that this was an initial proposal, and we asked the
ecosystem to provide input to help improve it. Since our announcement, we have been listening
carefully to their suggestions. Today, we&#x27;re excited to share some …</p>

As such, Eleventy will be returning to its roots as a side-project and transitioning away from full time development.
Up front, I do want to make a few things clear:
No action is required by folks building with Eleventy. Eleventy has always been independently bootstrapped and it is not changing ownership/stewardship. We march on independently as before.
We are thankful for the year of full time development and maintenance donated to the project by Netlify and I’m proud of the things we shipped in that time: including but not limited to the stable 2.0 release.

What is Spatial UI?
Spatial UI, also known as spatial user interface, refers to a type of UI design that leverages spatial and immersive technologies to enable users to interact with digital content in a three-dimensional space. It creates an interface that mimics the physical world, allowing users to interact with digital objects and environments using natural gestures, movements, and spatial awareness.

          <p>It&#x27;s our biggest open source icon set ever with 4,000 icons in four styles: Line/Solid/Duo/Flat
Core is like the Helvetica of icons. Neutral and versatile. Built on a tiny 14px grid for maximum legibility.
Currently, it&#x27;s available on Figma but we&#x27;re working to add it to our web app, desktop app, and GitHub.
Here&#x27;s a link to the file:

          <a href=https://app.theapricot.io/ target="_blank">Show HN: Apricot – because RSS won&#x27;t come back unless we move it forward</a>
          <p>I’ve been using RSS readers for decades, but they’ve started feeling more and more like a chore. Something about the inbox/to-do list design, counts of unread items, managing teams and complex filtering rules... I realized they add to my stress level instead of reducing it.
I’ve also come to rely on social media for discovery – hearing about new ideas, tools, papers, people, etc., but I’m so tired of the ads, spam, addictiveness, and toxicity.
Apricot is my attempt to distill the best of both worlds. It’s a web app where users subscribe to feeds like an RSS reader then see new items as they come in, in a single, combined, social media-style feed.
Apricot goes beyond traditional RSS readers in a couple other ways:
  * Users can follow TV shows (via TVmaze), Spotify podcasts, Substack newsletters, YouTube channels, and Subreddits (if/when they come back online) in addition to traditional RSS feeds. I’m open to adding other platforms if there’s demand and the content is programmatically accessible.

  * Cross-platform feed search. I know search isn’t hot at the moment but it’s pretty useful in this context. Search for “Star Trek” and find not just the TV shows, but the podcasts and Subreddits too.

  * Items can be sorted chronologically or with an ML-powered recommender system.

  * Users can filter their feed by platform, which is helpful for specific use cases like finding a good podcast episode for a car ride or a good TV episode to watch after dinner.

  * On-demand, GPT-powered content summaries help users see what an article is really about before clicking. (gotta sprinkle some gen AI on there!)

If you’ve got a few minutes (and come on, with Reddit offline, I know you do), check it out and let me know what you think!

          <p>Last week I had the privilege of attending CSS Day for the second year in a row (and MCing the second day!). I have to say it’s pretty much the most inspiring conference I’ve ever been to. Right off the bat, Una hit the nail on the head when she said that (paraphrasing) if we thought 2022 was a good year for CSS, we ain’t seen nothin’ yet.
Una’s talk was a whistle-stop tour of a huge number of features recently or just about to be released, which was mind-blowing in itself, but what was even more striking was the number of features she didn’t even have time to cover — a whole slide’s worth. It illustrates the blazing pace at which CSS is evolving right now, which as a CSS person, I’m very happy to see.
But I can understand why some people who aren’t quite as deeply immersed in the world of…</p>

          <p>Our family reached the end of what I call “The Luge”. At the beginning of every school semester my family and I hike to the top of the metaphorical mountain, buckle ourselves into a bobsled, and yeet ourselves downhill on a wild and uncontrolled ride.
