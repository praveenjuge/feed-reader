          <p>I&#x27;ve found it particularly useful for drawing SVGs.
Also allows mixing in new code blocks one by one, so you can have a REPL-like conversation and add/overwrite JavaScript functions one by one.
Screenshots and install instructions in the GitHub readme.
Taking suggestions for any other kinds of structured output to render, too!

          <p>Our co-worker thought we were heartless monsters. This is a slight exaggeration, but an important lesson about what gets lost in translation when apps aren’t entirely accessible. During an experimental Zoom call, we learned that screen readers and the reactions feature aren’t quite compatible. That means that every time during a call when someone mentioned […]</p>

          <p>I am interested in knowing how a bidding system works from a system design perspective.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find a detail design for this.  There are a couple of challenges that I can think of:
- many bidders for a specific item requiring multiple nodes
- accepting a bid is a transaction?
- ordering of bids as they come in
- invalidating bids once and reflecting that to a customer very quickly
Usually systems that are distributed that also need to be fast choose eventual consistency, but I am not sure how that would work in a bidding environment.  Any detailed resources (papers, blog posts, videos etc...) that I can review?  Thanks!

          <p>As a web designer, accessing online resources and tools is an essential part of your work. However, there are times when certain websites or services may be blocked or restricted, preventing you from accessing the content you need for research or inspiration. Sound familiar?
Online security and privacy are other concerns for professionals working in this field. That’s where proxies come in handy. These tools can provide web designers with greater flexibility, security, and performance when working online.
But before we explain how you can use them to make your projects more efficient and effective, let’s explore what proxy servers are and how they work.

          <p>In the past few days, I have read a lot about different variations of Flash Translation Layer. Most of them are designed for specific architectural designs. However, what about the most common solution that is widely used in today&#x27;s SSDs on the market? I know that this part of the SSD&#x27;s firmware is considered proprietary, as well as the device as a whole.
Any suggestions how this might be implemented?

          <p>Hey,
in my area, spring is arriving and while today we had some snow falling again, I’m regularly in my market garden again, planting vegetables, sowing radish, salads, carrots and more. It’s still such a great balance to my web work that I can only recommend having an outdoors activity to all those sitting in front of screens all day.
In my current projects, TypeScript, React and other tools are set as defaults. But I also realize that a lot of the standards I have in my mind are still not a default: responsive image optimization, bundle optimization, code splitting, performance audits and budgets, accessibility checks. Is it worth the effort of building type-safe code that in the end is transpiled anyway when we’re serving a nearly 1MB one-in-all JavaScript bundle containing scripts, sty…</p>

          <a href=https://www.zachleat.com/web/single-page-applications/ target="_blank">Defaulting on Single Page Applications (SPA)</a>
          <p>If you’re trying to build a single page application (SPA), you should probably use a tool designed primarily for the job. Site generators focused on performance, shipping low to zero-client-JavaScript (e.g. the one I work on, Eleventy) typically use full page navigations. SPA advocates have rebranded this architecture as a Multi-Page Application (MPA) but fundamentally this is how the web has always operated.
Classic multi-page architecture has a few benefits:
Better empty-cache performance: your site can render faster.

As web browsers become more privacy-focused and users spread their browsing across multiple web-capable devices, empty-caches visits are increasingly common.
Faster sites make more money. Read WPO Stats.
Search engines use site performance as a search ranking signal, which…</p>

          <p>I&#x27;m thrilled to share with you all a personal milestone in my life that I feel compelled to celebrate. My girlfriend, Julia, has been pursuing her dream of becoming a UX/UI designer for almost a year now while working in logistics, and today she has finally published her first project!
I can&#x27;t express how proud I am of her for putting in the hard work to make her dream a reality. It&#x27;s not easy to balance work and study (you know, sleepless nights to chase a dream), but she has done it with great determination.
Now that Julia has completed her first project, she&#x27;s excited to take the next step in her journey and is actively searching for job opportunities in UX/UI design. If any of you have any leads or know of any open positions in this field, we would be immensely grateful for any advice or guidance you can offer.
I know some of you may think it&#x27;s a small feat, but to us, it&#x27;s a significant accomplishment worth toasting. As a community of innovators and dreamers, I hope we can all take inspiration from Julia&#x27;s story and strive to follow our passions relentlessly.
Let&#x27;s raise a glass to Julia and all the aspiring designers out there who are working hard to turn their dreams into reality. Cheers!

          <p>TL;DR: Does anyone know of an AI-based voice app that allows you to manage calendar and mails?
I’ve been searching around a lot and couldn’t find a virtual AI (I.e cheaper than humans) assistant/app that’s voice based that allows me to manage my calendar and emails; I wanna be able to check what’s coming, quickly send attendees some follow up information, mail people, schedule new meetings etc. I’d be realistic about the quality and not use it for the most important customer communication etc but I’d assume AI in the last year has come far enough that some Startup us created such an app?

          <p>Our second alpha release of v5.3.0 has landed with a ton of enhancements and bug fixes for our new color modes! There’s still more to come, but we’ve held off shipping until we ironed out enough issues. Huzzah, we have!
This v5.3.0 release is a monumental update for Bootstrap 5. It’s big enough that it could’ve been a v6 on its own, but we wanted to do right by the community and get color modes out the door without the massive major release upgrade. We’re getting super close now, so bear with us as we continue to chip away at this.
And, in the meantime, here’s the rundown on what’s changed since our first alpha. Have a read through the Migration guide for the first alpha, or the blog post for the release announcement, if you’re just getting into v5.3.0.

The post Deprecating and removing Web SQL announced the deprecation of the Web SQL database technology. While the technology itself may be deprecated, the use cases addressed by the technology very much are not, so the follow-up post SQLite Wasm in the browser backed by the Origin Private File System, outlines a replacement set of technologies based on the SQLite database, compiled to Web Assembly (Wasm), and backed by the origin private file system. To close the circle, this article shows how to migrate databases over from Web SQL to SQLite Wasm.

          <p>I always wanted to make some sort of web app. As a .Net dev, I’ve used Winforms quite a bit. Even though it’s long outdated, I always found it intuitive for simple little apps. Is there any web UI software that shares the same drag and drop experience? React and all this other stuff feels like you need to take a boot camp course, too much hooking things together.

          <p>Hey there!
I am Kevin, a graphic designer for 12 years. I&#x27;ve had my fair share of communication mishaps and countless modifications. I soon realized that starting off projects with professional survey forms made all the difference in the world!  Thanks to these survey forms, my design business flourished, and my clients could truly appreciate the artistry in my work. And now, I want to share that experience with you!
dotBRAND is a collaboration platform that&#x27;s like having a co-pilot by your side, helping you communicate with your clients. At its core, dotBRAND provides professional survey templates to gather all the essential client information, files, and design intentions in one go!
Please give me your suggestions/feedbacks  on dotBRAND, I would be deeply appreciated!!

2. I want to be able to define my response-generating business logic using code, not using some DSL.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35251794 target="_blank">Ask HN: How will AI change UI?</a>
          <p>I just saw this blog post by Bill Gates on the top of HN:
&quot;The Age of AI has Begun&quot;
https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-Age-of-AI-Has-Begun
Gates writes that in his lifetime, two tech demos have struck him as revolutionary:
* Charles Simonyi&#x27;s demo of a graphical user interface (GUI/UI) in 1980
* OpenAI&#x27;s demo of an AI passing an AP Bio exam last year
How will these two technologies co-exist and influence each other?
What kinds of existing UIs will AI make obsolete? Or rather, what kinds of existing UIs are holding humans back from utilizing what AI can do?
On the flip side, what kinds of new UIs (aside from chat interfaces) could AI enable? What kinds of UIs are needed to let the power of AIs shine?

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35245329 target="_blank">Ask HN: So many software projects, but no reliable productivity metrics?</a>
          <p>I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on ways to understand (intentional not saying measure) productivity of software engineers with metrics. I know it&#x27;s a polarising topic and difficult to tackle. Usually the path of discussion goes to &quot;commits are not relevant&quot;, &quot;my situation is unique&quot;, &quot;requirements are changing&quot;, and so forth. But in the same time, after so many projects delivered and considering the maturity of tooling we have today (acknowledging that this make it also very complex), there are many, many things which are kind of predictable and similar to other delivered products. Outside a small percentage of developers which work on innovations, r&amp;d and areas which by nature are unpredictable, the vast majority are just doing the same stuff.
So what are your ways of understanding that someone is productive or not which is not based on gut, perception and other subjective factors?

If, regardless of the problem, the answer is crypto, homeopathy, or the internet, or perhaps GPT, essential oils or decarbonization, it’s possible we’re taking an easy way out.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35236635 target="_blank">Ask HN: Why doesn&#x27;t OpenAI care more about ChatGPT&#x27;s UX?</a>
          <p>Like many people here, I have been using ChatGPT almost since its launch. Considering the massive adoption, I am a bit surprised that the interface hasn&#x27;t evolved one bit in 3 months.
My issues:
-  Why is there no shortcut to my account/profile settings from ChatGPT&#x27;s left panel?
-  Why are my DALL-E money and ChatGPT/API money kept separate? These are two products from the same company, asking twice for my CC number.
-  Why do I have to refresh my page manually every time something went wrong? Couldn&#x27;t the page either refresh itself or recreate a clean connexion?
-  Why isn&#x27;t there a &quot;log in&quot; button from OpenAI&#x27;s landing page, plus a SSO detecting that I am already connected and linking (for instance) to my account, the products I use, etc.?
-  Why are their URLs so confusing? DALL-E is living at &quot;labs.openai.com&quot; (for the actual product) or &quot;openai.com/product/dall-e-2&quot; (for the product presentation). For ChatGPT it&#x27;s &quot;chat.openai.com/chat&quot; (why &quot;chat&quot; twice btw?), but it&#x27;s &quot;platform.openai.com/playground&quot; for the playground. Of course no page links to the others so you have to go back to the landing to access any of them (or access them through Google).
-  And finally, why is the search on their website so bad? I was looking for the playground, but &quot;openai.com/search?q&#x3D;playground&quot; sucked so much that I had to use Google to find it. And we are talking about an AI company indexing its own pages.
I understand OpenAI has other important things to do right now, but these are minor issues that would take a mediocre dev a few days to fix. This would easily make me 10% happier with a 1/1000000th of the resources needed to improve their models. Also, remember that Google got huge in the beginning by caring about stuff like this. So, why does nobody care?

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35223553 target="_blank">Ask HN: Semantic” CSS Framework?</a>
          <p>When I make applications on my own account that are server-side rendered I frequently use CSS to style things in a way similar to what I think CSS was intended for initially,  that is,  I apply styles to meaningful parts of the document (e.g. &quot;div.statusbar&quot;, &quot;table.postlisting th&quot;.)
Frequently I work on these things on and off for months or years and eventually they become a hot mess.
I&#x27;m looking for something that will help me have some discipline.  I do not like BEM, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and other frameworks that want to impose alien structures on CSS.  I like the intention of SASS/SCSS but don&#x27;t like the idea of complicating my build system.  (I like the idea of CSS Nesting as it works in Chrome but Firefox doesn&#x27;t have it yet unfortunately.  I want to use the latest features but I need support for Firefox and Mobile Safari with Chrome as a distant third.)  I would consider using a JS polyfill and I am using jinja2 template so anything I can bake into my python back end (maybe compile &amp; cache compiled CSS) would be possible.
Any advice for frameworks or other organizing principles?

I have decided to seriously start using RSS feeds. The signal v/s noise

I hope to prepare a default list, as a starting point; based on your recommendations below.

          <p>When I see the current chatbots they seem to mostly be geared towards simple Q&amp;A tasks and not towards supporting dedicated conversation. E.g. they have just one continuous conversation stream for everything. What features or design choices would be relevant for you to make chat AIs more usable?

Think Google Sheets or Airtable, but on your relational database. We provide a collaborative UI on top of Postgres, MySQL and other databases, enabling teams to view, edit and visualize their data.  Here’s our short demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;38RslBYdZnk
Accessing data is a challenge to team members who aren’t data analysts or engineers. Databases are usually locked down to a few team members, and everybody else has to rely on them to get access.

This also helps protect users from cross-site tracking by preventing reporting rendered URLs that don&#x27;t meet the minimum threshold.

          <p>I&#x27;m trying to understand the emerging UX in software products.
In the ChatSpot demo video, Dharmesh Shah talks about something called ChatUX. Though NLP to SQL existed in some form or the other, I think the game changer is the integration with generative AI.
Did you try adding something like ChatUX for your software product? Any other UX experiments you have tried? What were your learnings?

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/android-webview-header-privacy/ target="_blank">Improving user privacy by requiring opt-in to send X-Requested-With header from WebView</a>
          <p>When a user installs and runs an application that uses a WebView to embed web content, the WebView will add the X-Requested-With header on every request sent to servers, with a value of the application APK name. It is then left to the receiving web server to determine if and how to use this information.
We want to protect the user&#x27;s privacy by only sending this header on requests if the app developer explicitly opts in to share with services embedded within the WebView. To achieve this and let current online services that depend on this header migrate away from using it, we will run a Deprecation Origin Trial, while removing the header for general traffic. In parallel, we will be developing new privacy-preserving APIs (such as client attestation APIs) to match the use cases where the X-Requested-With header is being used today.
You can read more about why we&#x27;re making this change and how it works over at the Android Developer&#x27;s Blog in Improving user privacy by requiring opt-in to send X-Requested-With header from WebView.</p>

          <a href=https://remysharp.com/2023/03/11/i-had-a-good-week target="_blank">I had a good week [blog]</a>
          <p>Though it&#x27;s only been a few days since my last entry I got to the end of that week and took some stock and realised, aloud, that I had a good week.
Again, this is for me and those who know me. The usual tech nonsense will resume (one day!).

I hadn&#x27;t written anything on my blog for a while, or at least nothing that had flowed naturally so my &quot;flavour of funk&quot; post did come easily and it was good.
The Monday before that post (the evening before) I attended a (nearly impromptu) meetup run under Beyond Tellerrand from Marc Thiele and Storyblok. I saw friends who I&#x27;ve not seen in, what felt like a long time. I felt physically sick the whole time, in my guts but seeing talks, hearing ideas, seeing my friends faces - it was overall positive.
The next day I finally returned to the gym. It was gentle and I wrote the aforementioned blog post on the treadmill. It flowed out of me and the responsive was warm and friendly (thank you).
That evening I also had dinner with a long standing friend. So long that we agreed that we&#x27;d meet on the same day every month - which makes making sure we see each other much easier. It was nice, and they&#x27;d read my post (and are probably reading this post too, so hey ❤️).
Finally on the Thursday I started individual therapy (or counselling) properly (I&#x27;d had an introduction session the week before). I realised, and had to think carefully about it, that I had had a good week.
In the week that followed (last week), I&#x27;ve been trying to focus my thoughts on positive things to tell myself. I&#x27;m working on quietening down Bob&#x27;s voice in my head, and when it&#x27;s quiet, I&#x27;d like to begin to fill that emptiness with positive things, nice things, in my head.
It&#x27;s still early days, like those early pages in a book, those first weeks on a diet or at the gym, but it&#x27;s positive. I&#x27;m hopeful.</p>

          <p>Hello, I was wondering what computer monitor setup helps your productivity for game design. Do you use one curved monitor? Or multiple square monitors? Or some combination? Personally, I use two and had been thinking it is annoying not to have a dedicated area for code, game engine, api, chatgpt. It seems like a difficult balance to see proper information at once.

          <p>Do I need to get an EE master’s (VLSI focus, interested in this field) to understand the field better so that I can use AI to improve chip design and manufacture life cycle (as a CS grad)?
I am a cs grad, but I liked electronics since first year&#x27;s summer break when I took a practical course in electronics, then I played around with embedded systems &amp; ai &amp; robotics and web dev&#x27;s study materials for all of my college years and never got past any intro course in any of them. now after graduation I feel like I know nothing and interested in a lot of things and not being able to decide what to choose. now I am interested in both ai &amp; vlsi and can&#x27;t decide between:
1.using ai to automate the build process of ic chips. or,
2.using vlsi to design ai-specific chips to advance the field more and more.
being ignorant about both fields, I can&#x27;t make a decision. and I feel like I have to study both no matter what order of the two I pursue. so, I chose to start with ai as a tool for solving problems and then later in my career I pursue an MS in EE to understand the kind of problems in this field and how to solve it using ai. and this order is safer for me, giving my cs background, than to shift my career to EE as a fresh grad.
does this make any sense, or I am just wasting my time for lack of experience to decide?
and what is the job title for something like this? is it related to a VLSI CAD engineer?

          <p>Hey HN,
Similar to resumes, traditional job descriptions feel outdated. There is a lack of standardization in the industry, some mention compensation, some mention hard requirements, some are more flexible in requirements.
I&#x27;m curious if you were to build a job description standard, what types of fields would you want included? Some ideas of the top of my head:
- Compensation Bands
- If hard requirements are present, an explanation of why (i.e we don&#x27;t have capacity for mentorship, so we are looking for X years of work experience)
- LinkedIn of the hiring manager
- LinkedIn of the existing team
- A detailed over of the interview process
Would love to know what others think!

          <p>Olivia Hoskin
      Writer &amp; Design Enthusiast

The pivot into a more service-oriented business model as a B2B innovation and tech company comes with a new brand identity, including an updated logo to shift perceptions of the company from a mobile phone company. The new logo has a more geometric and abstract approach, balancing visual evolution and instant recognition.
Some say that the “new Nokia” resembles a distant echo of the original logo since so many elements have been stripped away. A bold graphic was used throughout all content, repurposi…</p>

          <p>Beginning gradually in Chrome 113,
storage, service workers, and communication APIs will be
partitioned in third-party contexts.
In addition to being isolated by the same-origin policy, the affected APIs used
in third-party contexts would also be separated by the site of the top-level
context. Sites that haven&#x27;t had time to implement support for third-party
storage partitioning can take part in a deprecation trial to temporarily
unpartition (continue isolation by same-origin policy but remove isolation
by top-level site) and restore prior behavior of storage, service workers, and
communication APIs in content embedded on their site.
In addition to a general unpartitioning deprecation trial, it&#x27;s possible to
participate in a focused deprecation trial just for window.sessionStorage.

  Transitions created with the View Transition API. Try the demo site–Requires Chrome 111+.



Warning
In our efforts to work on future enhancements to this feature, we broke it in Chrome Canary. Oops! But hey, that&#x27;s what Canary&#x27;s for. If you want to try view transitions today, use stable Chrome 111, or beta Chrome 112.
These kinds of transitions were a frequently-requested feature from developers, including me, and I think we&#x27;ve managed to land it in a way that balances good defaults with extensibility and customization. That sounds like we&#x27;re patting ourselves on the back, but developer feedback was key to the design of this feature. An earlier pro…</p>

# Recorder updates
# Replay extensions support
The Recorder introduces support for custom replay options that you can embed into DevTools with an extension.
Try out the example extension. Select the new custom replay option to open the custom replay UI.
To customize the Recorder to your needs and integrate it with your tools, consider developing your own extension: explore the chrome.devtools.recorder API and check out more extension examples.

          <p>Federated Credential Management API (FedCM) is a
web API for privacy-preserving identity federation. With identity federation, an
RP (relying party) relies on an IdP (identity provider) to provide the user an
account without requiring a new username and password.
FedCM is a purpose-built API that allows the browser to understand the context
in which the RP and IdP exchange information, inform the user as to the
information and privilege levels being shared and prevent unintended abuse.
# Updates
There are a few updates to Chrome&#x27;s FedCM implementation:
For the ID assertion
endpoint, IdPs need to
check the Origin header (instead of the Referer header) to see if the
value matches the origin of the client ID.
A new Chrome flag

          <p>Hi HN!
I am quite excited as this is my second product, launched today: Versionfeeds.
https://versionfeeds.com
What is Versionfeeds? I was quite annoyed by the fact that I had no central place where I could see all the software releases. I use software a lot, be it at my job, to build my side projects, or tools hosted on my NAS at home. It&#x27;s literally dozens, if not hundreds of tools, packages or even programming languages. And most of them receive updates regularly.
That is why I built Versionfeeds. It allows me to bundle all the releases for the software I need and love, into one dedicated feed. At the moment, all public repositories on Github and Gitlab are available. You can also search on npm (Javascript) and Packagist (PHP) for your software. More providers will come soon.
The feeds adhere to the Atom standard and can be consumed with any feed reader. If maintainers use markdown in their release notes, it will be converted to HTML.
Any feedback, wishes and ideas are welcome. Please share your thoughts with me. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35069802

          <p>I&#x27;m planning on making a small web app using SSR rather than splitting the backend and client work. In researching options for the project (Go based), I&#x27;ve &quot;discovered&quot; that there&#x27;s a _lot_ more to templates than what I&#x27;ve used in the past (Jinja2 via Django, Flask, and Ansible).
So to the actual web developers here, what template engines do you use and why? I&#x27;ve never worked with compiled templates but they seem interesting, though I don&#x27;t know their cost/benefit tradeoffs very well yet.
Your choice of language, stack, syntax preference, what-have-you! I&#x27;m just genuinely curious about the broader templating ecosystem and workflows.

          <p>When it comes to web design and development, PHP frameworks are a popular choice for their reliability and efficiency. Laravel and Symfony are two of the most widely used PHP frameworks, and they both have their own strengths and weaknesses.
If you’re a web designer, developer, or team working with clients, it’s important to determine which framework is best suited for your project. Choosing the right framework will save you time, increase efficiency, and ultimately improve collaboration between designers and developers.
In this article, we’ll compare Laravel vs. Symfony, and provide guidance to help you choose the framework that’s most appropriate for your next project.

          <p>Writing code can be repetitive, and many developers (myself included) opt to make our lives easier by configuring our code editor of choice to auto-complete common statements in the given coding language.
My own preferred editor, VS Code, includes Intellisense out of the box, which provides common code snippets for auto-completion as you type. Pressing Enter or Tab inserts them into your code.
Perhaps you need something more custom? There are many extensions in the VS Code Marketplace that provide snippets in a variety of languages. Personally, I use Sarah Drasner’s Vue VS Code Snippets extension, which includes a whole bunch of snippets for Vue.
Writing our own snippets
But we can also create our own snippets! To try this out, let’s create a snippet for a min-width media query — something…</p>

          <p>Building UI used to be fun when there were limited choices. You would use bootstrap and sass/less  or css modules, and just get things done.
Now there are just so many options to choose from and such a feeling of FOMO.
Each new one that comes out and moves up the rankings (https://2022.stateofcss.com/en-US/css-in-js/) makes me feel a need to evaluate it. There is always a little benefit from each new framework but then it also can make other things harder.
I really just want nice pre-built components to use.
Tailwind has great components and templates, but its such a mess too look at when you want to deal with dynamic styles, and is slow to compile with webpack and tricky with monorepos, and then you have to use things like twind, twin.macro, windicss.
I miss the days of jquery + sass so badly. It was so straightforward. Nested css for everything and then when you need complex stuff: just use jquery to add/remove styles.
Every single new framework has so many edge cases that just wear you down. Styled Components and Emotion seemed so great, but just so many freaking edge cases, and perf issues.

          <p>I made a ChatGPT client that is contained in 1 HTML file. Would love to know what you guys think.
The idea is to have something very simple to use that people can just download and use. If they want, tweak as per their liking. (You will need an OpenAI API to use it).
- It doesn&#x27;t call or use any 3rd party services (except jQuery and Bootstrap loaded from a CDN). Use your own API key, call the OpenAI API directly in its normal functioning ( there is a chatbot feature to pull top HN headlines which calls the HN API ).
- Its just an HTML file, so you can run it from anywhere.

          <p>A user’s clipboard is a “catch all” between the operating system and the apps employed on it. When you use a web browser, you can highlight text or right-click an image and select “Copy Image”. That made me think about how developers can detect what is in the clipboard. You can retrieve the contents of […]

          <p>Particularly when it comes to the future. And perhaps about the past. More often than not, we find ourselves in situations where we don’t know. Where we can’t know. That’s a given. The open question is how often we claim that stance. If it feels uncomfortable or awkward to acknowledge that we don’t know, we’re […]</p>

          <p>The cross-company Capabilities Project (code name Project Fugu) at Google has the objective of making it possible for web apps to do anything platform-specific apps can. Apart from Google, project partners include Microsoft, Intel, Samsung, and others. The project enables amazing web applications like Photoshop by exposing the capabilities of the underlying operating systems to the web platform, while maintaining user security, privacy, trust, and other core tenets of the web.
But what are examples of apps that make use of these capabilities? Our answer to this question is the Project Fugu API Showcase. It is sourced by community submissions, and contains a filterable list of apps that make use of one or more of the Fugu APIs.
Propose missing apps to the showcase by submitting them via an anonymous form. Submissions are reviewed regularly and the showcase will be updated accordingly.
After living in an embedded iframe that didn&#x27;t really allow the showcase to fully shine, we have now worked on migrating it to a new home, and have polished its look and feel a fair bit, too. Find the Project Fugu API Showcase at its new location developer.chrome.com/fugu-showcase!
Launch each app by clicking its name, screenshot, or the Launch app link. For many apps, you can also see the source code by clicking View source. On browsers that support the Web Share API, click Share app to do exactly that. As a special inception Easter egg, the Project Fugu API Showcase is of course contained in the Project Fugu API Showcase.
Be sure to subscribe to the RSS feed so you never miss a new Fugu app.</p>

Supply your own API key and chat away. You can also save sessions to a file and continue at a later time. Be forewarned that it is very much a proof-of-concept and unpolished.

          <p>I am experimenting with a smart RSS reader that filters my feeds.  One of my favorite sources is The Guardian, which is strong on world news and particularly the UK and Australia.
Although watching the decline and fall of the remnants of the British empire is quite entertaining and The Guardian has some US news I feel I am not getting enough US news in my mix.
There are numerous things I like about The Guardian such as:  (i) their outlook (but I like The Economist also which leans right of The Guardian),  (ii) quality of reporting, (iii) volume of output, (iv) substantial text (but not too much) in the feed, and (v) no paywall.
Are there good RSS feeds for US news that share some of these attributes?

          <p>I&#x27;ve been considering learning web design for some time now, but with the rise of no-code tools, templates, and AI-powered website builders, I&#x27;m starting to wonder if it&#x27;s still worth it.
I understand that having a strong understanding of design principles can give me more flexibility and customization when it comes to building websites. However, it seems like more and more people are using no-code tools and templates to quickly create websites without the need for any specialized knowledge.
So, is learning web design still worth it in 2023?

Denying the existence of the other ones is easier than dealing with them.

          <p>Olivia Hoskin
      Writer &amp; Design Enthusiast 

There’s nothing like reminiscing on your first job. For many, it may have been babysitting, working in food service, as a camp counselor or instructor, or even tutoring. A first job is memorable because it’s often your first taste of independence, earning your own money, or a moment of entrusted responsibility.
Landing your first design job is no different! You may even feel more sentimental about your first design job. While your first job may have been mainly motivated by financial gain (nothing beats those hard-earned babysitting bucks), your first design job was likely more intrinsically valuable.
And if you’re still working towards landing your first design job, this one’s for you! We asked our community how they landed their first desi…</p>

          <a href=https://www.inthezoneapp.com/ target="_blank">Show HN: In The Zone – An app to boost productivity and fight interruptions</a>
          <p>The Zone is the state where you are completely focused and fully productive. It takes time to get there, but the slightest distraction can knock you out of it and you have to start over.
So I built this app to track productivity and measure the impact of interruptions.
This is how it can help:
• Launching the app and starting to get in the Zone is a commitment to work. It can prevent you from procrastinating and is a good motivator to actually start working and to keep distractions away.
• The timer can help you decide if it’s a good time to take a pause because you’ve been in the Zone for a long period, or if it is better to continue working because you’ve just entered the Zone.
• Your colleagues will notice the color change from yellow to red. This is a great signal that helps them understand the impact of interruptions on your productivity.
• Statistics help you measure your daily productive time.
• Using your phone for other purposes is considered an interruption by the app, so that’s already one distraction taken care of.

          <a href=https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar target="_blank">Show HN: Mathesar – open-source collaborative UI for Postgres databases</a>
          <p>Hi HN! We just released the public alpha version of Mathesar (https://mathesar.org/, code: https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar).
Mathesar is an open source tool that provides a spreadsheet-like interface to a PostgreSQL database.
I was originally inspired by wanting to build something like Dabble DB. I was in awe of their user experience for working with relational data. There’s plenty of “relational spreadsheet” software out there, but I haven’t been able to find anything with a comparable UX since Twitter shut Dabble DB down.
We&#x27;re a non-profit project. The core team is based out of a US 501(c)(3).
Features:
* Built on Postgres: Connect to an existing Postgres database or set one up from scratch.
* Utilizes Postgres Features:  Mathesar’s UI uses Postgres features. e.g. &quot;Links&quot; in the UI are foreign keys in the database.
* Set up Data Models: Easily create and update Postgres schemas and tables.
* Data Entry: Use our spreadsheet-like interface to view, create, update, and delete table records.
* Data Explorer: Use our Data Explorer to build queries without knowing anything about SQL or joins.
* Schema Migrations: Transfer columns between tables in two clicks in the UI.
* Custom Data Types:: Custom data types for emails and URLs (more coming soon), validated at the database level.

          <p>My son Otis wants me to help him make a video game. When he says “we should make a game”, he means “me” because despite a lot encouragement from his parents he hasn’t shown interest in coding classes. I also have a lot going on with the whole “starting a company” deal, so I was hesitant to pick up another big project… but he’s persistent and I’ve been in the mood to make a video game.
We sat down one evening to write out a game design document. After capturing the who, the what, the when, the where, and the “how it’s fun” we had a rough idea for an open world 3D game that was like Breath of the Wild but Link is a dog and it has online co-op.

A summary of our scope document:
Who: Dog and Cat
What: Walk around in a 3D open world, get weapons to fight bad guys, find items and easter eggs, so…</p>

          <a href=https://css-irl.info/a-native-visually-hidden-class/ target="_blank">A Native “Visually Hidden” in CSS? Yes Please!</a>
          <p>If you’ve been writing CSS for any length of time, the chances are you’ll have come across situations where you need to hide some text visually, but still have that text available to assistive technologies (such as screenreaders). Icon buttons and skip links are just two examples. (There are plenty more.) Simply using display: none hides text from assistive technologies, which is not useful to us in this scenario. So developers over the years have come up with clever ways to hide text visually, which usually manifest as a utility class that gets copied and pasted into every project, often called .visually-hidden or .sr-only — something like:
.sr-only {
  border: 0 !important;
  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px) !important;
  -webkit-clip-path: inset(50%) !important;
  clip-path: inset(50%) !important;
  height: 1px !important;
  overflow: hidden !important;
  margin: -1px !important;
  padding: 0 !important;
  position: absolute !important;
  width: 1px !important;
  white-space: nowrap !important;
}
It’s so common that even popular CSS frameworks like Tailwind come with built-in .sr-only classes.
But as Ben Myers points out in this excellent article on why the web needs this as a native feature, there are problems with this. One issue is that there are many variations on this snippet, which have been found to cause problems as browsers and have evolved over time. Ben argues that it’s about time this became a native feature, and I absolutely agree. In the article, Ben outlines some of the advantages and drawbacks to the various forms this might take, such as a value of the display property, a property all of its own, or a HTML attribute. I recommend giving it a read, and hopefully something will come out of it 🙂

          <p>How do you currently tether one element to another? You might try tracking their positions, or use some form of wrapper element.


  I’m the anchor
  
I’m the anchored thing

/* styles.css */
.container {
  position: relative;
}
.anchored {
  position: absolute;
}
These solutions often aren&#x27;t ideal. They need JavaScript or introduce extra markup. The CSS anchor positioning API aims to solve this by providing a CSS API for tethering elements. It provides a means to position and size one element based on the position and size of other elements.
# Browser support

          <a href=https://hlog.pro/ target="_blank">Show HN: hLog.pro (a Hacker News archiver with a card based UI)</a>
          <p>I wrote a simple site that uses the HN API to save new submissions. Even if they&#x27;re deleted on Hacker News, they&#x27;ll be saved on hLog. It looks for new posts every 3 minutes.
It also has a basic search that looks at the title, url and submission text (if any).
It&#x27;s not optimised in terms of pagination of results (nor the actual page content). If you press &quot;Search&quot; without anything in the search box, you&#x27;ll get a list of all the records in the database. There are around 4,200 right now.
I wrote it in Python (Django) using SQLite3. It runs on a free VPS hosted on Oracle Cloud. I wrote this mainly to improve my understanding of Django. I&#x27;m mainly a backend guy but i want to build some frontend skills and i thought a project like this would allow me to learn that.
Any feedback would be much appreciated, even if it&#x27;s negative. I know there are hundreds (if not thousands) of HN mirrors/clones out there, but this is for my learning. If you could suggest any improvements, i may be able to learn new things i otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have.

Nick Babich, an Israel-based UX and product designer, has had an unlikely assistant in his workflow of late: ChatGPT, the viral AI chatbot.
Over the last few weeks, Babich has asked ChatGPT to write dummy copy for his app and website designs, sketch out layouts, and even generate font and color pairing ideas. Since its launch in November, Babich says he’s been able to integrate the chatbot “in almost all areas of product design that don’t require creating media content.”
ChatGPT’s primitive interface, developed by the Microsoft-backed research firm OpenAI, which counts Elon Musk as its co-founder among several others, has become a familiar…</p>

          <p>Here’s a breakthrough that’s about to happen somewhere: A GPT that reads every email that anyone in your organization has ever sent and makes it easy to ask it questions about what the entire organization knows. A person could probably not find the time, bandwidth or privacy constraints to do this. But this accessible but unembarrassed database tool could quickly become a huge asset for any organization that installed it–even a soloist. Tell me who I know or what I know about XYZ… Or consider the power of a network. If my colleagues opt in, I can simply ask the […]</p>

          <p>I recently dusted off a relatively old (~5 years) MacBook and replaced the battery with the plan that I could use it as a secondary machine, for my “non-work” stuff. The last couple of times I’ve got a new Mac I’ve gone for the option of cloning my old setup, so I don’t need to install everything again. This time, however, the whole point was to keep things simple, minimal and (hopefully) fast, so I decided to completely wipe it and start from scratch.
If you’re a developer, naturally there’s a bunch of stuff you need to install to get your environment perfectly right for coding. The following is the process I went through to install the things I need for my setup, written purely to remind me what I did, when I inevitably have to do it again sometime.
1. Install VSCode

          <p>Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State (CHIPS) is a Privacy Sandbox technology that allows developers to opt a cookie into &quot;partitioned&quot; storage, with separate cookie jars per top-level site.
CHIPS is being developed with the goal to become an open web standard. It is under discussion in the PrivacyCG and has had an origin trial for 7 months during which the Chrome team has received helpful feedback. During development the team worked with key stakeholders to explore that feedback, resulting in an updated design that better serves the web ecosystem.
Let&#x27;s explore two challenges that the Chrome team faced in implementing CHIPS and how community feedback played a key role in evolving the proposal design.
