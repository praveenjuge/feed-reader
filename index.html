          <p>I’ve come across several products that automatically convert Figma designs into code. From what I see, they do a good job of generating React components and CSS from Figma designs.
It seems to be that these should be the standard way to make frontends, but it is not. Why is that? Am I missing something?
Example: Anima.app

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34330634 target="_blank">Ask HN: How to share productivity tips and tools among developers in a company</a>
          <p>As a software engineer, on my own I’ve been able to increase my efficiency and productivity at my current job over the years with the help of various programs such as command line interfaces (CLIs), GUI extensions (VS, VS Code, Chrome), software applications, and other shortcuts (aliases, etc.).  I know everyone has different preferences and work styles, but I can’t help but think what I’ve been able to apply would be useful for other developers at my company.
Undoubtedly, there are other developers at my company have their own set of programs/workflows they use to increase their efficiency that I think could be useful to me and others.
I&#x27;m curious to know what strategies other developers use or have used within their company to share productivity tips and programs with their colleagues. For example, is there a dedicated Teams/Slack channel, an internal wiki, or some other type of software where engineers can share/demo programs and shortcuts they use in their day-to-day work?

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34330134 target="_blank">Ask HN: Consolidated RSS feeds for independent blogs?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;ve been experimenting with a smart RSS reader and I&#x27;ve been using Superfeedr to ingest content.  Superfeedr monitors RSS feeds and calls a webhook when content arrives,  I stuff these into an Amazon SQS and then spool them out at my leisure.
My system requires a fairly high volume (1000&#x27;s of articles) to train a machine learning model so I have been focusing on high volume feeds like preprints from the arXiv,  news from the Guardian, etc.
Now Superfeedr charges 10¢ per feed per month,  my bill right now is $3 a month.  It&#x27;s reasonable that I can subscribe to about 100 feeds on Superfeedr but subscribing to 1000 feeds seems pricey to me.
There are a lot of independent blogs out there that publish an article every week or every six months.  What they all have in common is that somebody has to poll an RSS file many many many times per article ingested.  W/ superfeedr it makes for high costs but it is a hassle even if I built my own RSS ingest system.
One thing that would help would be consolidated RSS feeds that aggregate posts from a large number of blogs.  Are there good ones out there?  Are there other answers to problem of polling hundreds or thousands of independent blogs?

          <p>Good riddance.

# Recorder: Copy as options for steps, in-page replay, step’s context menu
Open an existing user flow in the Recorder. Previously, when you replayed the user flow, DevTools would always start the replay by navigating to or reloading the page.
With the latest updates, the Recorder shows the navigation step separately. You can right-click and remove it to perform in-page replay!
Apart from that, you can right-click a step and copy it to the clipboard in the *Recorder panel instead of exporting the whole user flow. It works with extensions too. For example, try to copy a step as a Nightwatch Test script. With this feature, you can update any existing script with ease.

And there’s plenty more.

# OPFS on Android
The Origin Private File System (OPFS) is part of the File System Access API, it is a storage endpoint private to the origin of the page.
It was launched on desktop on Chrome 102, Chrome 109 increases its compatibility by making it available on Android.
With a couple of exceptions, it includes all of the File System Access API surfaces, to seamlessly manage files directly from the local file system. The show*Picker() methods and the Drag-an…</p>

          <p>Form validation has always been my least favorite part of web development. You need to duplicate validation on both client and server sides, handle loads of events, and worry about form element styling. To aid form validation, the HTML spec added some new form attributes like required and pattern to act as very basic validation. […]

          <p>Luxury goods are items that are worth more (to some) because they cost more. The cost itself is the benefit that is being sold. There used to be a correlation between superior performance and price. In 1900, an Hermes saddle or a Louis Vuitton trunk was arguably better built for the work it was put […]</p>

          <p>Hi.
I&#x27;m curious, how do you prefer consuming RSS news feed?
Do you prefer text-oriented News Aggregators like the HackerNews website or image-oriented ones with a small text/description layout?
Personally, reading small text only like HN page sometimes I feel there should be more customization to config view for user preferences, but I don&#x27;t need images preview out there.
What about you?

          <p>At one point during the construction of my house, we needed designs for the kitchen and bathroom cabinets and a bedroom wardrobe.
I wanted full control of the design process. Doing it in vector illustration software was too painful and it was taking too long. But I didn&#x27;t have the time to learn any complex CAD tool either.
So I developed a small HTML/JS/CSS tool for designing MDF furniture by writing my own little language that transpiles into a CSS grid layout.
Take a look at the blog post for details:

Or go directly to the tool (works best on desktop or tablet): https://alnvdl.github.io/squareplanner/

After a good long hem n’ haw about Texas politics my friend Daniel filled a conversational pause by jokingly asking…
“So what’s good?”
A question made in jest, but it has stuck in me like a knife. I now see my ability to complain everywhere. On the walk to school with neighbors they ask how it’s going, “Ughck. I’m busy”, or “Ughck. It’s hot”, or “Ughck. Kids putting on shoes, amirite?!”
I’m trying to figure this out. It’s starting to bother me because I don’t believe myself to be a negative or overly pessimistic person. But there are times I hear the vibe-killing “Debbie Downer” sludge pouring out of my mouth.
The best I can come up with is…
I think it’s easier to complain? My negativity bias bubbling to the surface. Is it easier for humans to commiserate on bad circumstances rather than celebrate good ones?
It’s an attempt to self-deprecate? Life is going good but I don’t want you to think it’s going too good.
My engineering brain? I spend every day finding and predicting problems, is my brain over-tuned to find problems?
Either that or I’m a big ol’ StrongSad. Hm.</p>

          <p>You may have noticed that when you eventually find something, it’s in the last place you looked. Mostly because after that, you stop looking. And when a long-awaited moment finally arrives, the respite comes just in time, when we’re at the end of our rope. That’s largely because if we give up before then, it […]</p>

          <p>What - I am working on a specification/language which can describe a traditional system design process for web-services.
Why - Having a language for system-design will improve design interviews and system documentation. It can also give rise to &quot;Competitive Designing&quot; industry same as &quot;Competetive Programming&quot; exists currently.
How - I am exploring existing specs (Docker-compose, OpenAPI and UML) and a way to merge them. They will define the system.
For the actual execution, I will use the spec to setup a sandbox environments and run blank instances of services in them. Then I would use custom defined API flows from the spec to simulate an actually running system.
This is not the hard part. The hard part is finding a way to benchmark these API flows which gives reliable scores for the effectiveness of the system for a given problem and API flows.
Happy to discuss more.

          <p>New year, new commitments.
I&#x27;ve been loosing weight successfully in the past but I have the impression it impacts my productivity and my mood: I get tired, I have low energy, even lethargic.
I want to remove the excess kgs again in next 6 months and would love to hear your hacks to dieting without loosing my positive energy.
Many thanks!

I haven’t done a yearly review in a few years. Looking back at those old posts, it seems like I wrote some very bland listicles that wrapped up the different web development community work and side projects that happened during the year. This year I’m just gonna write free-form and see what happens 😅.

Probably the biggest news this year is that Eleventy graduated from side project to full time sponsorship (thank you Netlify!!) in February and everything changed.
Looking back at the before-times, I’m not sure how I managed this project without full time sponsorship.
The most important thing I’m doing in my life is being a dad. I’m reminded of the Jamstack Conf panel a few months back. The moderator asked panelists “What do you like to …</p>

          <p>Psst… I’ve been keeping a secret. As part of my Web Components course on Frontend Masters, I built an entire guidebook on how to get started with Web Components. A Web Components 101. I spent hundreds of hours preparing the materials for the course and I’m excited to announce that today I’m making the guidebook public for everyone to get started with Web Components.
Read the Guidebook
This guidebook is different! Most Web Component resources drop you right into the JavaScript parts. Ughck. That’s fine, I guess, but seeing the markup for a  component doesn’t make my heart or brain sing. It also doesn’t help me understand one of Web Components’ biggest mental hurdles: The Shadow DOM. To overcome this, I’ve intentionally designed my course to build out layer-by-layer from HTML→CSS→JavaScript, like how old timers learned the web development in the past.
Starting with  and  –and most certainly with Web Component styling– you become familiar with the quirks of Shadow DOM first before writing your own from scratch. Following the navigation from left-to-right you’ll learn the ins-and-outs of Using → Styling → Writing the different flavors of Web Components. And because it’s part of the Web Platform, that knowledge will always be valuable.
HTML-first may seem overly basic, but I find that lots of new and experienced developers alike have never even tried using a Web Component off the shelf. That’s my favorite part of Web Components! You can use lots of Web Components without a build process or any kind of Webpack sorcery. A script tag + HTML and you’re using them! Web Components make it easy to (dependably) use other people’s code.
You can of course still watch my Web Components course on Frontend Masters. I recommend it if you’re an visual or auditory learner like myself. There’s also a bit more back-and-forth with the live audience and their questions.</p>

          <p>As seen with things like open source software, many developer tools, Hacker News as a website and people&#x27;s opinions on CSS and modern web design on places like Reddit?
Cause it feels like many people&#x27;s tastes come from the 80s/early 90s, with the idea that any sort of visual flourish or attempt at readability is completely irrelevant.
And it makes me wonder why this is. Why do so many... hacker type individuals seem to prefer very brutalist, utilitarian designs over anything more fancy? Where did this preference for plain text at the expense of all else come from anyway?
Because I don&#x27;t think this happens quite as much in other fields, like architecture, cooking or construction.

          <p>Hey all, I&#x27;m a product designer and I built this cause&#x27; when I was designing liquidity pool and staking features for this DAO, I didn&#x27;t know how the user flow worked and how the UI looked for similar pages, so I was constantly switching back and forth Balancer, Uniswap, and OlympusDAO as references.
I thought that I might not be the only one with this problem, so I built this library of userflow screenshots, and annotated them, to share with the web3 community of builders, designers, and developers.
Would love feedback if you&#x27;re a builder in web3, let&#x27;s connect too!
(Also I&#x27;m aware that there are some that&#x27;ll claim web3 is a scam, but I believe in it, to each their own.)

          <p>The idea that things become hits mostly due to a small number of large audiences rather than point to point viral sharing seems intuitively correct to me: www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/viralit…
Or at least the large audiences “seed” the viral behavior</p>

          <p>As employees return from holiday break, [Shopify] said it’s conducting a “calendar purge,” removing all recurring meetings with more than two people “in perpetuity,” while reupping a rule that no meetings at all can be held on Wednesdays. Big meetings of more than 50 people will get shoehorned into a six-hour window on Thursdays, with a limit of one a week.
This is fascinating to me.  I get the desire to remove bloated meetings, but there are recurring meetings that I find genuinely valuable to have sync (project standups / staff meetings).  Curious if this ends up being a long term policy for Shopify or more of a culture reset.</p>

          <p>I read 13 “work related” books in 20221. They’re broken up by category below.  I didn’t think any of these books were bad, but the ones I would recommend have a star next to them.
Decision Making
⭐ How To Decide by Annie Duke - Annie Duke takes her poker background and applies it to making decisions in other contexts – lots of practical decision making strategies here
⭐ The Scout Mindset by Julia Galef — somewhat similar ground to to “How You Decide”, but more of a focus on viewing the world objectively.  I really enjoyed reading these 2 books together.
Productivity
⭐ Make Time by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky — A nice book full of practical tips for managing your time and reclaiming control from distractions
Product Process
⭐ The Messy Middle by Scott Belsky — The best description of what …</p>

Stacking viruses ran through our kids over the course of three weeks. My immune system was shaky but held on. It culminated in ear infections in both kids and I learned the city of Austin has a shortage on antibiotics. New, incredible ways the American healthcare system can fail that I never anticipated.
This month ended in some sadder news that after a series of tests and treatments we’ve learned that our 13 year old dog Rudy has Transitional Cell Carcinoma, a form of bladder cancer that is inoperable and non-responsive to radiation and chemo. The outlook is not good, a matter of weeks or months, and we’re already at weeks. Holding out hope the k…</p>

          <p>Spent the last 3 years in home office where I have a standing desk setup. Came into a coworking space today with no standing desks. Feel like I’m half asleep. I can’t be any more than 50-60% as productive as when I was standing!
Crazy that we know sitting is bad for you. How much productivity change, if any, have you felt if you’ve tried switching to stand up work?
Also, what an easy win for a lot of companies, if productivity changes 10-20% plus on standing desks, what an incredible easy boost that is.

          <p>A few years ago I wrote an article about how to detect VR support with JavaScript. Since that time, a whole lot has changed. “Augmented reality” became a thing and terminology has moved to “XR”, instead of VR or AR. As such, the API has needed to evolve.

Work
At the end of 2021 I started a new job as Senior Front End Developer at Ada Mode, a data science and AI company working in the renewable energy sector. It’s been a great year for the company, as we’ve taken on a bunch of exciting projects and continued to make a name for ourselves. The year has been full of interesting challenges and learning opportunities for me personally, working with Vue and D3.js in particular, (and AWS, which has been less fun 😅) and it’s been a pleasure to work with the friendly and knowledgeable team. I’m looking forward to the company continuing to grow in 2023 as we hire new developers and begin projects spanning sustainable agriculture, wind energy, nuclear decommissioning, solar power an…</p>

          <p>Another year has come and gone. I can’t believe it. I think I’ll look back on 2022 as a year of milestones. It’s been a year of new jobs, new challenges, new products, and new hobbies. This is my second year piecing my year together from my monthly vibechecks. I think I’ve boiled those posts down to some major themes from the past year.
My new job at Luro

The biggest change this past year is my employment, I’m working full-time on Luro. What began as a side project app has grown into it’s own little stealth startup. And when I say startup, I mean startup. Over the course of the last year, we took a bit of pre-seed investment, made our first hires, re-architected the app, and onboarded our first round of private beta users.
There have been ups and downs starting a SaaS business in the head…</p>

          <p>let&#x27;s say I am using Tailwind CSS (licensed under MIT) in my website by using the npm package &quot;tailwindcss&quot; which on build creates a css file. According to MIT - &quot;The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.&quot;.
The css file that is created has a comment on top &quot;/* ! tailwindcss v3.0.23 | MIT License | https://tailwindcss.com */&quot;
Is that sufficient? or do I need to include the whole MIT text or do I need to make a /license page and write about it there &quot;tailwindcss is used in this website, licensed under MIT - full MIT license here&quot;? if not, how do I do it correctly?
I saw some sites like which seem to use tailwindcss but in the devtool sources only have the top line in the css &quot;tailwindcss v3.0.23 | MIT License | https://tailwindcss.com&quot; is that a violation of the MIT license?

          <p>Finally feeling like society around me has settled into it&#x27;s stride, even many normal things have happened, but as I write my last blog post of the year (as I&#x27;ve done for over a decade), I&#x27;m not entirely happy with how I feel like my blog has been neglected.
Work
Since the pandemic hit us back in early 2020, I&#x27;ve been working (mostly) flat out because we really didn&#x27;t know what would happen to the economy.
My typical work contract would be, at most, a few months, but instead I&#x27;ve been working very long term with clients. This is really good for our security but not something I&#x27;m used to and I can see the impact it&#x27;s had on my creativity around side projects that I&#x27;d normally work towards.
More obvious (to me) is my lack of blogging and really the motivation to write has gone utterly kaput.…</p>

          <p>Reacting to events with JavaScript is the foundation of a dynamic experiences on the web. Whether it’s a click event or another typical action, responding to that action is important. We started with assigning events to specific elements, then moved to event delegation for efficiency, but did you know you can identify elements by position […]

          <p>It’s one thing to know about what’s in the browser document, it’s another to have insight as to the user’s browser itself. We’ve gotten past detecting which browser the user is using, and we’re now into knowing what pieces of the browser UI users are seeing. Browsers provide window.personalbar, window.locationbar, and window.menubar properties, with the […]

That said, it’s also nice to have JavaScript events that also allow us to change behavior. Did you know you’re provided events both before and after printing? I’ve […]

          <a href=https://www.rssbrain.com/ target="_blank">Show HN: RSS Brain</a>
          <p>I wrote an RSS reader called RSS Brain recently. The motivate is the current RSS readers either don&#x27;t sort articles by priority, which makes it hard to read posts from HackerNews and Reddit, or sort it with some &quot;smart&quot; algorithm which I don&#x27;t trust. I also like the Google News feature that can show related story from different source, but the sources are not configurable and the algorithm is not transparent either. So with RSS Brain, I implemented these features:
* Recommend related articles from the feeds of your choice. It&#x27;s backed by ElasticSearch and the algorithm is described on RSS Brain&#x27;s website.
* Option to sort articles by upvotes and time. The algorithm is similar to the old Reddit and you can find it on the website as well.
* Save search terms into folders so you can filter the articles.
I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and found these features very helpful. So I want to share this on HackerNews. The frontend is written in Flutter so it has cross platform clients, even though the web version don&#x27;t feel very &quot;web native&quot; because the level of Flutter web support. I guess only time can improve that.
I don&#x27;t have enough hardware to scale it up so it&#x27;s currently in subscription mode to limit the users. I&#x27;m going to open source the code (maybe non-commercial license) once I think it&#x27;s ready so you can host it by yourself. It&#x27;s still in early stage and haven&#x27;t been tested by a lot of people. So any feedback is helpful. Thanks!
Update: Added a scroll down hint in the landing page. Thanks for the feedback.

          <p>Hi there, I built a chrome extension to grab new posts from social media.
Instagram, twitter, Pinterest, etc don&#x27;t really allow for RSS so I worked on this alternative to get new posts. Hope this might be useful for some of you.

          <p>I am making a feed reader that (i) would like to show you a significant amount of text in the feed and (ii) builds models to cluster and classify the text
In terms of length I like the abstracts of scientific papers on sites like arxiv.org.
I have more scientific papers now than I can stand, so I am looking for high volume RSS feeds of a huge paragraph or a few small paragraphs on any topics:  the subject could be sports or javascript programming, product reviews, any kind of journalism or other non-fiction.
Good length is the first qualification but to feed this beast I would love feeds that get 10, 20 or 50 articles a day.
Any suggestions?

          <p>Some software (e.g. a calendar) is used every day, and some software (e.g. a marketing website) is used once and then never again. Here are some ways interface design changes if the interface is used more often.</p>

          <p>When it comes to animations on the web, developers need to measure the animation’s requirements with the right technology — CSS or JavaScript. Many animations are manageable with CSS but JavaScript will always provide more control. With document.getAnimations, however, you can use JavaScript to manage CSS animations! The document.getAnimations method returns an array of CSSAnimation […]

          <p>I just downloaded my Google &quot;MyActivity&quot; takeout html file (it&#x27;s a file of all your activity on Google and Chrome that you can download for yourself. It&#x27;s an HTML file).
It was multiple hundreds of MB in size.
I opened it in Notepad++ and searched for &quot;etymology&quot;. I&#x27;m an etymology junkie. And was amazed at how many word/phrase origins I had searched for that I couldn&#x27;t even remember searching for.
The problem was that it was very very slow. I didn&#x27;t expect Notepad++ to choke on such a large file, but it did. (It wouldn&#x27;t open in Chrome, it froze Chrome.)
Any thoughts on what app I should open it in if all I want to do is text search?

          <p>Quite a lot of us tech writers don’t get everything 100% right all of the time. Sometimes a small typo might elude us, sometimes we make the odd factual error despite our best efforts and research. Sometimes we phrase something clumsily, giving the wrong impression, omit some piece of information (intentionally or unintentionally), or perhaps misinterpret something we’ve read elsewhere. I’m as guilty as anyone. Especially on this blog, where I don’t always have time to proofread as thoroughly as I should. I worry a lot about being “correct”, particularly as my readership has increased over the past few years, and always endeavour to ensure my articles are as accurate as possible. It’s part of the reason why writing for others takes me so much longer than writing for myself. I always want t…</p>

          <p>Knowing when resources are loaded is a key part of building functional, elegant websites. We’re used to using the DOMContentLoaded event (commonly referred to as “domready”) but did you know there’s an event that tells you when all fonts have loaded? Let’s learn how to use document.fonts! The document.fonts object features a ready property which […]

          <p>I&#x27;ve came to deep realization that CSS is the most important  thing for building a website. It holds the key to becoming full stack developer or just a backend developer. It&#x27;s everything in frontend.
Sooner or later, you&#x27;ll need vanilla css. You can&#x27;t depend on bootcrap or failwindcss. Your site looks like same if you do so. And many components aren&#x27;t available there.
There are components like carousel, cards hover etc etc..How to polish all these skills?
Is there a course for it?
I try to practice it like randomly, but there are no tutorials. I&#x27;m not at a phase where I can read complex long code and  decode it.

          <p>Firstly, I wish everyone a merry Christmas.
If you log onto Hacker News everyday, you&#x27;ll notice that a lot of changes have happened in the website.
For starters: the navigation bar&#x27;s color has changed to a slightly darker shade of red, rather than the orange background.
The top post numbers are now in alternating red and green colors (christmas colors).
I couldn&#x27;t have been the only one to notice, right? In the beginning I thought something was messed up - only to realize what day it was today.

          <p>I watched the documentary General Magic (mentioned in Tony Fadell’s book Build) about the 1990s Apple spin-off company General Magic that built the iPhone before the iPhone. Ultimately the product was a commercial failure, but the documentary is a wonderful look at product design and what happens when you let talented engineers roam free range. They invented USB, created capacitive touch screen GUIs, and imagined the portable “Post-PC” world before Windows 95 and the Internet were ever popular. Ultimately the product was a failure, too early for its time. How did they build this product? Well the answer is… prototypes.
My favorite part of the documentary is Megan Smith beaming over her cabinet full of hardware prototypes. Her focus on making something people love, an intimate device, is infectious. Her eagerness to blend everyone’s wishes with the harsh reality of available and affordable hardware shows. Starting with off-the-shelf components and inventing if necessary. When describing the product, she’s not talking about megabytes, protocols, and pixels, but talking about the sound, the feeling, the touch of the product and software in people’s hands.
I feel more vindicated than ever that prototypes, put in people’s hands, are the biggest opportunity to capture lightning in a bottle. These people are imagining and building the iPhone 17 years before the iPhone launched. Megan Smith talks like Steve Jobs, but Steve Jobs doesn’t work at Apple or General Magic. We often herald the invention of the iPhone or Android and these magic devices as invented out of thin air or our collective science fiction, but both of those products used by billions of people rose from the ashes of General Magic’s failure. That’s a lot to dwell on. The composting of failures produces rich and fertile soil.</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34116679 target="_blank">Tough time building components of a site using vanilla CSS. What to do?</a>
          <p>By now, I&#x27;m done with basics html,css,bootstrap coding. I can build navbar, build a hero section with image and h1 text and a footer. That&#x27;s all.
There are various components in a website though. I&#x27;d like to be able to build any of them whenever required if I&#x27;m in a job.
I wanted to build a timeline using html and css but it&#x27;s not entering my head at all. I&#x27;ve seen codes from multiple websites.
https://imgur.com/a/L7c1Bkj
This is the timeline that I want to build. Looks pretty simple but I&#x27;m unable to build it. How do I deal with stuffs like this? How do I learn these stuffs?
Is there a course that helps to deal with these stuffs? There&#x27;s no point of having learn CSS if I can&#x27;t build these stuffs with my visualization. Please guide me.
The scary thing here is that if I can&#x27;t build these stuffs then there is 0 point of me learning css. And I&#x27;m not going to get any full stack or frontend jobs like that way.

          <p>It’s a Christmas miracle—Bootstrap v5.3.0-alpha1 has arrived just in time for the holiday break! This release brings new color mode support, an expanded color palette with variables and utilities, and more.
We’re keeping things short and simple in this blog post with deeper dives into the new color modes and more coming in future posts. For now, we want you to enjoy the holiday break and come back next year feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. Keep reading for what’s new and we’ll see you next year!
Dark mode and color modes


Bootstrap now supports an explicit opt-in for creating multiple color modes via the data-bs-theme attribute on the root

          <p>MailChimp used to send out a client&#x27;s newsletters from RSS feed without issue. A few weeks ago, they started showing up a day later. After weeks of trying to get support to track down this bug, we finally got this response
&quot;Thank you for your patience while my team looks at this. We were able to confirm that the best time range currently to space the blog posts is 10-12 hours before Mailchimp&#x27;s sending time. There just isn&#x27;t enough time between your posts and the feed to pull the new content.
As a best practice, I would plan your content releases a day in advance with this functionality in mind.&quot;
It started with 4 hours, now they are telling us 10-12 hours in advance? My client runs a news site and sends our daily news. It&#x27;s not always possible to even publish content that far in advance. It&#x27;s insane to me that this functionality was working fine, for years. That they have managed to break and instead of fixing are saying just publish an insane amount of time ahead of the newsletter being sent?
I&#x27;m not sure what it takes to get someone&#x27;s attention at MailChimp to actually fix this. Read the RSS feed before sending the scheduled post. Like it used to. Otherwise, what newsletter providers would people recommend replacing MailChimp with?

To help raise your awareness of their possibilities, Nicolas Hoffmann shares his experience of how he and his team at Proton carried out a massive move from CSS logical props to production and how you can consider them from a different perspective in your very own projects.</p>

in my last newsletter this year, the 13th, I want to say thank you to all of you: Thanks for being my audience, for reading my emails, and articles, sharing them, and giving me feedback. I really appreciate every single email you write to me. Happy holidays and happy new year!

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/early-stable/ target="_blank">Change in release schedule from Chrome 110</a>
          <p>We are making a change to the release schedule for Chrome. From Chrome 110, the initial release date to stable will be one week earlier. This early stable version will be released to a small percentage of users, with the majority of people getting the release a week later at the normal scheduled date, this will also be the date the new version is available from the Chrome download page.
For Chrome 110 the key dates will be:
Beta: January 12, 2023
Early Stable: February 1, 2023
Stable: February 7, 2023
You can keep track of upcoming release dates and included features on the Chrome Status Roadmap, and on the Chromium Dashboard. The beta posts have more details of features, and any deprecations and removals for each release.
# Why are we making this change?
By releasing stable to a small percentage of users early, we get a chance to monitor the release before it rolls out to all of our users. If any showstopping issue is discovered, it can be addressed while the impact is relatively small.
For most developers this change will have little impact. Keep following this blog for up to date information on features and any upcoming deprecations and removals. We aim to bring you any relevant information in good time for you to act upon it, before any change in Chrome.

Does it exist?
Is it the right info?
Is it delivered clearly?
Is it reliably up to date?
Can people find it reliably?

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34037748 target="_blank">Ask HN: How can I design a generic library that provides its own endpoints?</a>
          <p>I like how ActivityPub can be implemented on any website and provide a good set of endpoints to enable rich, social-media-like content interactions. I&#x27;d love to enable my current website to respond to those requests, but I don&#x27;t want to either use &quot;activitypub-express&quot; or install a full Mastodon (or any other) server just for myself.
My idea was to implement the protocol myself, which would be a nice way to learn it and its problems. But I would also love to make it a library that can be applied by others on their own, already existing websites.
The problem that I am having is that the current methods to implement this kind of pluggable extension involve connecting to one specific back end framework, such as creating an Express middleware.
What I was thinking was:
- Use TypeScript (to leverage the large JS community)
- Make it as vanilla as possible
- Use fetch standards such as the Request and Response objects, which are available natively since Node 18
- Provide multiple adapters for common frameworks such as Express, Fastify, Next.js, Astro, etc
Is this solved elegantly on any other language or framework?

          <p>I’ve been working for the past month on some updates to this site designed to make it easier for me to post a bit more.  The key pieces you should know if you follow this blog:
I’ve pulled the name of the newsletter I ran last year (Herding Lions) into the blog – this is now Herding Lions and I’ll be putting all my eng leadership content here in addition to the other content I’ve historically covered here.
I’m adding a micro blog for shorter posts / to have a central controlled place for my short term content while Twitter meltdowns and everybody sorts out what’s coming next in that space.
If you subscribe to my existing RSS feed you’ll now receive both full articles and micro blog posts.  If you prefer to receive only the full articles (longer form stuff on engineering leadership and soft…</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34014642 target="_blank">Ask HN: What is the successor to HTML Applications (.hta)?</a>
          <p>Back in the day (late 90s), Microsoft had a format called &quot;HTML Application.&quot;
It was just an HTML page with a &quot;.hta&quot; file extension. Opening such a file would open it in a chrome-less browser, and give the scripting in the page access to the file system.
I used to love these things. I wrote a bunch of little apps in them.
Some examples:
https://medium.com/@anht_59851/html-application-hta-a-gui-for-your-scripting-on-windows-bfaacf2c3bdd
These still exist, but there are problems with them:
1. Coding is a bear. They run in the mshta.exe process, and that spawns an instance of... IE9, I think? There&#x27;s no &quot;inspect&quot; panel, for instance, and errors just pop a modal with no debugging information.
2. Near as I can tell, they use an older version of ECMAScript. &quot;let&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to work, not does &quot;addEventListener,&quot; etc. I kept getting weird &quot;Syntax Errors&quot; for things that appeared to be valid, contemporary JavaScript.
3. I&#x27;m quite sure some security software (like on my laptop, issued by employer), blocks these from executing.
What&#x27;s the current-day equivalent of these?  I want to write an HTML page complete with CSS and JS, double-click on it from my desktop, have it open in a browser instance of its own, and have access to the file system.
I essentially want a way to create little GUI apps, without having to use WinForms.
What am I looking for? Is it Electron?
(Note: I&#x27;m on Windows)

          <p>After we ran the previous survey to help choose the syntax for CSS Nesting, the CSS Working Group continued debate over the best way to define nesting in CSS. During the discussions new syntax ideas were suggested. To help the Working Group choose between any of these syntaxes, there is a new survey.
# The Options
Based on the results of the previous survey, options one and two are no longer being considered. Two new options (four and five) have been added.
# Option 5: Top-level nesting container
Introduces a top-level @nest rule that contains a &amp; { … } block with declarations and multiple nested style rules.
@nest selector {
  &amp; {
    property: value;
  }
  nested-selector {
    property: value;
  }
}
# Option 4: Postfix proposal
An extra code block containing the nested rules is inserted after main rule which contains the declarations.
selector {
  property: value;
} {
  nested-selector {
    property: value;
  }
}
# Option 3: Non-letter start proposal
Every nested rule to be unambiguous on its own, by requiring it to start with a non-symbol. You can write &amp; div or :is(div) if you need to start a selector with a type selector.
selector {
  property: value;
  &amp; nested-selector {
    property: value;
  }
}
While the snippets above are only used to demonstrate the basics of each proposal, there are many more examples included along with the new survey.

          <p>I made a chrome extension to extract styles from elements on a webpage. Its surprisingly hard to do without access to chrome debugger API in manifest V3. It doesn&#x27;t work for every site and I’m still improving it. A particular sore spot is with media queries but I&#x27;m working on a solution.
Any feedback is appreciated.

          <a href=https://css-irl.info/logical-border-radius/ target="_blank">Logical Border Radius</a>
          <p>Confession: I almost never write border-radius as shorthand, largely because I can never remember the order. My brain is wired to remember margin and padding shorthands (top, right, bottom, left), but when it comes to corners it’s a different story. Do I start from the top left corner, or the top right? So I usually resort to the longhand, which is admittedly verbose, but at least has the advantage of being explicit, for me and any future readers of my code. For the record, these are equivalent:
div {
  border-radius: 10% 20% 30% 75%;
}
div {
  border-top-left-radius: 10%;
  border-top-right-radius: 20%;
  border-bottom-right-radius: 30%;
  border-bottom-left-radius: 75%;
}
In the shorthand, we start from the top left corner, and go round clockwise, ending with the bottom left.

          <p>We started the Chrome Dev Insider series this year to bring you closer to the Chrome team, sharing what we are working on and how we approach our decisions. As we march towards the end of 2022, I thought it would be a good time to reflect on the past year.
I couldn&#x27;t think of a better person to talk about this than Parisa Tabriz, our VP of Engineering and Product. Parisa took the reins of our work on both the browser and the open web platform, earlier this year. I hope you enjoy this interview as much as I did.
Let&#x27;s start with your self-appointed &quot;Security Princess&quot; tag. What&#x27;s the story?
Parisa: I actually started my career in cybersecurity because a web application I built in college got hacked and defaced by spammers, and I was curious about what happened. (What happened was SQL inject…</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/cws-policy-revamp-jan23/ target="_blank">Chrome Web Store Policy Updates</a>
          <p>We are announcing a set of policy updates designed to encourage the development
of high quality products, prevent deceptive behavior, and ensure informed user
consent. These updates include:
Minimum Functionality Policy Update
—Expands our current Minimum Functionality Policy to include
click-baity template extensions, empty extensions, and extensions that do not
directly provide their stated functionality.
Misleading and Deceptive Behavior Policy Update
—Prohibits anti-virus, privacy, and security extensions that provide no
discernible protection or monitoring.
Affiliate Ads Policy
—Establishes new disclosure requirements for extensions that include
affiliate ad programs. Developers will now be required to disclose any
affiliate programs to users before installation. Additionally, related user
action is required before the inclusion of affiliate codes, links, or
cookies.
Developers can also learn more about today&#x27;s guidance in our Program Policies.
These policy clarifications will go into effect on January 15, 2023. After that
date, extensions in violation of these new policies may be removed from the
Chrome Web Store and be disabled.
If you have any questions, you can contact developer support.
Thank you for your cooperation, and for your participation in the Chrome
extension ecosystem!

          <p>As a designer, your brand is more than your awwward winning website and the final_final_v2 assets you deliver to your client.
It’s the entire client journey from start to finish.
Unfortunately, designers are forced to use tools that are dated, clunky, and give clients an experience far from “designer”.
The good news is that there are tools you might not know about that can fix this. See for example this free invoice generator that was created for creatives.
To build a brand that enables you to raise your rates, you have to connect every client touch-point in an experience that is beautiful and intuitive.
To do this, every designer must decide if they will use individual tools or an all-in-one platform like Bloom. While individual tools will give you more features, they are far more expensi…</p>

          <p>WebPageTest has supported Google&#x27;s Lighthouse as part of our test suite for a while now, and there are a number of great reasons to choose to run Lighthouse on WebPageTest (accurate packet-level throttling, clean test environment with careful configuration to ensure accuracy and repeatability, always the latest version, etc. etc.)
That said, we&#x27;ve long felt that there were opportunities to make better use of Lighthouse results alongside WebPageTest&#x27;s broader test analysis. Today, we took the first steps towards that goal with a new Lighthouse result page that has a number of unique features we think you&#x27;ll find very useful.
A New Lighthouse Result Page
As of today, WebPageTest&#x27;s Lighthouse results will now be displayed like other first-party test result pages on WebPageTest:

          <p>It was always “Oh, you’re only at risk of automation if your job has a high degree of repetition, creative jobs are less at risk” but it feels like over the course of the past year Copilot, Dall-e, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and ChatGPT have decided upend that assumption. Writing, code, art… all with computers nipping at the heels with competency and speed. Fascinating. Unexpected in my lifetime. A mild bit alarming, but fascinating nonetheless.
I don’t think it’s all bad, but my brain is still ramping up to the new reality that these handicrafts have (likely) been permanently altered. We should celebrate the lower bar for creative endeavors; you no longer need to be an expert at Photoshop to produce a creative image, just an expert at generating prompts. People are extracting beautiful artifacts from these machines. Incredible.
