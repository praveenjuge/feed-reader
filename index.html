          <p>Hi HN!
I am quite excited as this is my second product, launched today: Versionfeeds.
https://versionfeeds.com
What is Versionfeeds? I was quite annoyed by the fact that I had no central place where I could see all the software releases. I use software a lot, be it at my job, to build my side projects, or tools hosted on my NAS at home. It&#x27;s literally dozens, if not hundreds of tools, packages or even programming languages. And most of them receive updates regularly.
That is why I built Versionfeeds. It allows me to bundle all the releases for the software I need and love, into one dedicated feed. At the moment, all public repositories on Github and Gitlab are available. You can also search on npm (Javascript) and Packagist (PHP) for your software. More providers will come soon.
The feeds adhere to the Atom standard and can be consumed with any feed reader. If maintainers use markdown in their release notes, it will be converted to HTML.
Any feedback, wishes and ideas are welcome. Please share your thoughts with me. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;35069802

          <p>I&#x27;m planning on making a small web app using SSR rather than splitting the backend and client work. In researching options for the project (Go based), I&#x27;ve &quot;discovered&quot; that there&#x27;s a _lot_ more to templates than what I&#x27;ve used in the past (Jinja2 via Django, Flask, and Ansible).
So to the actual web developers here, what template engines do you use and why? I&#x27;ve never worked with compiled templates but they seem interesting, though I don&#x27;t know their cost/benefit tradeoffs very well yet.
Your choice of language, stack, syntax preference, what-have-you! I&#x27;m just genuinely curious about the broader templating ecosystem and workflows.

          <p>When it comes to web design and development, PHP frameworks are a popular choice for their reliability and efficiency. Laravel and Symfony are two of the most widely used PHP frameworks, and they both have their own strengths and weaknesses.
If you’re a web designer, developer, or team working with clients, it’s important to determine which framework is best suited for your project. Choosing the right framework will save you time, increase efficiency, and ultimately improve collaboration between designers and developers.
In this article, we’ll compare Laravel vs. Symfony, and provide guidance to help you choose the framework that’s most appropriate for your next project.

          <p>Writing code can be repetitive, and many developers (myself included) opt to make our lives easier by configuring our code editor of choice to auto-complete common statements in the given coding language.
My own preferred editor, VS Code, includes Intellisense out of the box, which provides common code snippets for auto-completion as you type. Pressing Enter or Tab inserts them into your code.
Perhaps you need something more custom? There are many extensions in the VS Code Marketplace that provide snippets in a variety of languages. Personally, I use Sarah Drasner’s Vue VS Code Snippets extension, which includes a whole bunch of snippets for Vue.
Writing our own snippets
But we can also create our own snippets! To try this out, let’s create a snippet for a min-width media query — something…</p>

          <p>Building UI used to be fun when there were limited choices. You would use bootstrap and sass/less  or css modules, and just get things done.
Now there are just so many options to choose from and such a feeling of FOMO.
Each new one that comes out and moves up the rankings (https://2022.stateofcss.com/en-US/css-in-js/) makes me feel a need to evaluate it. There is always a little benefit from each new framework but then it also can make other things harder.
I really just want nice pre-built components to use.
Tailwind has great components and templates, but its such a mess too look at when you want to deal with dynamic styles, and is slow to compile with webpack and tricky with monorepos, and then you have to use things like twind, twin.macro, windicss.
I miss the days of jquery + sass so badly. It was so straightforward. Nested css for everything and then when you need complex stuff: just use jquery to add/remove styles.
Every single new framework has so many edge cases that just wear you down. Styled Components and Emotion seemed so great, but just so many freaking edge cases, and perf issues.

          <p>I made a ChatGPT client that is contained in 1 HTML file. Would love to know what you guys think.
The idea is to have something very simple to use that people can just download and use. If they want, tweak as per their liking. (You will need an OpenAI API to use it).
- It doesn&#x27;t call or use any 3rd party services (except jQuery and Bootstrap loaded from a CDN). Use your own API key, call the OpenAI API directly in its normal functioning ( there is a chatbot feature to pull top HN headlines which calls the HN API ).
- Its just an HTML file, so you can run it from anywhere.

          <p>The cross-company Capabilities Project (code name Project Fugu) at Google has the objective of making it possible for web apps to do anything platform-specific apps can. Apart from Google, project partners include Microsoft, Intel, Samsung, and others. The project enables amazing web applications like Photoshop by exposing the capabilities of the underlying operating systems to the web platform, while maintaining user security, privacy, trust, and other core tenets of the web.
But what are examples of apps that make use of these capabilities? Our answer to this question is the Project Fugu API Showcase. It is sourced by community submissions, and contains a filterable list of apps that make use of one or more of the Fugu APIs.
Propose missing apps to the showcase by submitting them via an anonymous form. Submissions are reviewed regularly and the showcase will be updated accordingly.
After living in an embedded iframe that didn&#x27;t really allow the showcase to fully shine, we have now worked on migrating it to a new home, and have polished its look and feel a fair bit, too. Find the Project Fugu API Showcase at its new location developer.chrome.com/fugu-showcase!
Launch each app by clicking its name, screenshot, or the Launch app link. For many apps, you can also see the source code by clicking View source. On browsers that support the Web Share API, click Share app to do exactly that. As a special inception Easter egg, the Project Fugu API Showcase is of course contained in the Project Fugu API Showcase.
Be sure to subscribe to the RSS feed so you never miss a new Fugu app.</p>

          <p>This is just something I whipped up earlier today in a few hours for experimenting with the ChatGPT API in Rust.
Supply your own API key and chat away. You can also save sessions to a file and continue at a later time. Be forewarned that it is very much a proof-of-concept and unpolished.

          <p>I am experimenting with a smart RSS reader that filters my feeds.  One of my favorite sources is The Guardian, which is strong on world news and particularly the UK and Australia.
Although watching the decline and fall of the remnants of the British empire is quite entertaining and The Guardian has some US news I feel I am not getting enough US news in my mix.
There are numerous things I like about The Guardian such as:  (i) their outlook (but I like The Economist also which leans right of The Guardian),  (ii) quality of reporting, (iii) volume of output, (iv) substantial text (but not too much) in the feed, and (v) no paywall.
Are there good RSS feeds for US news that share some of these attributes?

          <p>I&#x27;ve been considering learning web design for some time now, but with the rise of no-code tools, templates, and AI-powered website builders, I&#x27;m starting to wonder if it&#x27;s still worth it.
I understand that having a strong understanding of design principles can give me more flexibility and customization when it comes to building websites. However, it seems like more and more people are using no-code tools and templates to quickly create websites without the need for any specialized knowledge.
So, is learning web design still worth it in 2023?

There’s nothing like reminiscing on your first job. For many, it may have been babysitting, working in food service, as a camp counselor or instructor, or even tutoring. A first job is memorable because it’s often your first taste of independence, earning your own money, or a moment of entrusted responsibility.
Landing your first design job is no different! You may even feel more sentimental about your first design job. While your first job may have been mainly motivated by financial gain (nothing beats those hard-earned babysitting bucks), your first design job was likely more intrinsically valuable.
And if you’re still working towards landing your first design job, this one’s for you! We asked our community how they landed their first desi…</p>

          <a href=https://www.inthezoneapp.com/ target="_blank">Show HN: In The Zone – An app to boost productivity and fight interruptions</a>
          <p>The Zone is the state where you are completely focused and fully productive. It takes time to get there, but the slightest distraction can knock you out of it and you have to start over.
So I built this app to track productivity and measure the impact of interruptions.
This is how it can help:
• Launching the app and starting to get in the Zone is a commitment to work. It can prevent you from procrastinating and is a good motivator to actually start working and to keep distractions away.
• The timer can help you decide if it’s a good time to take a pause because you’ve been in the Zone for a long period, or if it is better to continue working because you’ve just entered the Zone.
• Your colleagues will notice the color change from yellow to red. This is a great signal that helps them understand the impact of interruptions on your productivity.
• Statistics help you measure your daily productive time.
• Using your phone for other purposes is considered an interruption by the app, so that’s already one distraction taken care of.

          <a href=https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar target="_blank">Show HN: Mathesar – open-source collaborative UI for Postgres databases</a>
          <p>Hi HN! We just released the public alpha version of Mathesar (https://mathesar.org/, code: https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar).
Mathesar is an open source tool that provides a spreadsheet-like interface to a PostgreSQL database.
I was originally inspired by wanting to build something like Dabble DB. I was in awe of their user experience for working with relational data. There’s plenty of “relational spreadsheet” software out there, but I haven’t been able to find anything with a comparable UX since Twitter shut Dabble DB down.
We&#x27;re a non-profit project. The core team is based out of a US 501(c)(3).
Features:
* Built on Postgres: Connect to an existing Postgres database or set one up from scratch.
* Utilizes Postgres Features:  Mathesar’s UI uses Postgres features. e.g. &quot;Links&quot; in the UI are foreign keys in the database.
* Set up Data Models: Easily create and update Postgres schemas and tables.
* Data Entry: Use our spreadsheet-like interface to view, create, update, and delete table records.
* Data Explorer: Use our Data Explorer to build queries without knowing anything about SQL or joins.
* Schema Migrations: Transfer columns between tables in two clicks in the UI.
* Custom Data Types:: Custom data types for emails and URLs (more coming soon), validated at the database level.

          <p>A useful web page to show visually what the mobile assistive keyboard looks like given different input types.
Specifically, and TIL - the inputmode can be different, i.e. using a type&#x3D;&quot;text&quot; field but inputmode&#x3D;&quot;url&quot; to help with partials like &quot;.com&quot; (if the input field didn&#x27;t need URL validation for instance).

          <a href=https://css-irl.info/a-native-visually-hidden-class/ target="_blank">A Native “Visually Hidden” in CSS? Yes Please!</a>
          <p>If you’ve been writing CSS for any length of time, the chances are you’ll have come across situations where you need to hide some text visually, but still have that text available to assistive technologies (such as screenreaders). Icon buttons and skip links are just two examples. (There are plenty more.) Simply using display: none hides text from assistive technologies, which is not useful to us in this scenario. So developers over the years have come up with clever ways to hide text visually, which usually manifest as a utility class that gets copied and pasted into every project, often called .visually-hidden or .sr-only — something like:
.sr-only {
  border: 0 !important;
  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px) !important;
  -webkit-clip-path: inset(50%) !important;
  clip-path: inset(50%) !important;
  height: 1px !important;
  overflow: hidden !important;
  margin: -1px !important;
  padding: 0 !important;
  position: absolute !important;
  width: 1px !important;
  white-space: nowrap !important;
}
It’s so common that even popular CSS frameworks like Tailwind come with built-in .sr-only classes.
But as Ben Myers points out in this excellent article on why the web needs this as a native feature, there are problems with this. One issue is that there are many variations on this snippet, which have been found to cause problems as browsers and have evolved over time. Ben argues that it’s about time this became a native feature, and I absolutely agree. In the article, Ben outlines some of the advantages and drawbacks to the various forms this might take, such as a value of the display property, a property all of its own, or a HTML attribute. I recommend giving it a read, and hopefully something will come out of it 🙂

          <p>How do you currently tether one element to another? You might try tracking their positions, or use some form of wrapper element.


  I’m the anchor
  
I’m the anchored thing

/* styles.css */
.container {
  position: relative;
}
.anchored {
  position: absolute;
}
These solutions often aren&#x27;t ideal. They need JavaScript or introduce extra markup. The CSS anchor positioning API aims to solve this by providing a CSS API for tethering elements. It provides a means to position and size one element based on the position and size of other elements.
# Browser support
You can try out the CSS anchor positioning API in Chrome Canary behind the &quot;Experimental Web Platform Features&quot; flag. To en…</p>

          <p>I wrote a simple site that uses the HN API to save new submissions. Even if they&#x27;re deleted on Hacker News, they&#x27;ll be saved on hLog. It looks for new posts every 3 minutes.
It also has a basic search that looks at the title, url and submission text (if any).
It&#x27;s not optimised in terms of pagination of results (nor the actual page content). If you press &quot;Search&quot; without anything in the search box, you&#x27;ll get a list of all the records in the database. There are around 4,200 right now.
I wrote it in Python (Django) using SQLite3. It runs on a free VPS hosted on Oracle Cloud. I wrote this mainly to improve my understanding of Django. I&#x27;m mainly a backend guy but i want to build some frontend skills and i thought a project like this would allow me to learn that.
Any feedback would be much appreciated, even if it&#x27;s negative. I know there are hundreds (if not thousands) of HN mirrors/clones out there, but this is for my learning. If you could suggest any improvements, i may be able to learn new things i otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have.

Nick Babich, an Israel-based UX and product designer, has had an unlikely assistant in his workflow of late: ChatGPT, the viral AI chatbot.
Over the last few weeks, Babich has asked ChatGPT to write dummy copy for his app and website designs, sketch out layouts, and even generate font and color pairing ideas. Since its launch in November, Babich says he’s been able to integrate the chatbot “in almost all areas of product design that don’t require creating media content.”
ChatGPT’s primitive interface, developed by the Microsoft-backed research firm OpenAI, which counts Elon Musk as its co-founder among several others, has become a familiar…</p>

          <p>Here’s a breakthrough that’s about to happen somewhere: A GPT that reads every email that anyone in your organization has ever sent and makes it easy to ask it questions about what the entire organization knows. A person could probably not find the time, bandwidth or privacy constraints to do this. But this accessible but unembarrassed database tool could quickly become a huge asset for any organization that installed it–even a soloist. Tell me who I know or what I know about XYZ… Or consider the power of a network. If my colleagues opt in, I can simply ask the […]</p>

          <p>I recently dusted off a relatively old (~5 years) MacBook and replaced the battery with the plan that I could use it as a secondary machine, for my “non-work” stuff. The last couple of times I’ve got a new Mac I’ve gone for the option of cloning my old setup, so I don’t need to install everything again. This time, however, the whole point was to keep things simple, minimal and (hopefully) fast, so I decided to completely wipe it and start from scratch.
If you’re a developer, naturally there’s a bunch of stuff you need to install to get your environment perfectly right for coding. The following is the process I went through to install the things I need for my setup, written purely to remind me what I did, when I inevitably have to do it again sometime.

          <p>Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State (CHIPS) is a Privacy Sandbox technology that allows developers to opt a cookie into &quot;partitioned&quot; storage, with separate cookie jars per top-level site.
CHIPS is being developed with the goal to become an open web standard. It is under discussion in the PrivacyCG and has had an origin trial for 7 months during which the Chrome team has received helpful feedback. During development the team worked with key stakeholders to explore that feedback, resulting in an updated design that better serves the web ecosystem.
Let&#x27;s explore two challenges that the Chrome team faced in implementing CHIPS and how community feedback played a key role in evolving the proposal design.

          <p>There are things we avoid looking at too closely. If we looked, really saw what was happening, we’d have to change our minds, admit we were mistaken, refactor our priorities or take action. It’s so frightening that we even hesitate to make a list of the things we don’t want to look at. Because the list itself is frightening. If we don’t see it, it feels safer.</p>

          <p>Starting in Chrome 110 (February 2023) we are gradually introducing a fixed value for Android version and device model—the default value will always be Android 10 on a model K.
If you rely on the user-agent to detect a visitor&#x27;s operating system version, Android device model, or detailed browser version then you may need to take action—read on for the details.


The user-agent is a string that provides information about the user&#x27;s browser and their environment—like knowing that a visitor on your site is running Chrome version 110 on Android.
Your browser sends this in an HTTP header and makes it available via JavaScript.
The problem with full user-agent string is that it shares detailed information about the browser by default on every request which is a major factor in allowing cross-site…</p>

We&#x27;ve seen good technical discussions derailed when participants stop listening to each other; we&#x27;ve also seen dominant voices shut out interest from newcomers who don&#x27;t feel included.  Even among those of us who have been doing this for a long time, it is all too easy to answer bluntness with curt responses, and curt responses with rudeness; unfortunately, this escalates disagreements, and makes collaboration impossible. Several of us in the Chrome team set out to work with the community to develop some insights into how to improve.

          <p>Sites that load fonts with font-display: swap often suffer from a layout shift (CLS) when the web font loads and is swapped with the fallback font.
You can prevent CLS by adjusting the dimensions of the fallback font to match that of the primary font. Properties such as size-adjust, ascent-override, descent-override, and line-gap-override in the @font-face rule can help override the metrics of a fallback font allowing developers more control over how fonts are displayed. You can read more about font-fallbacks and the override properties in this post. You can also see a working implementation of this technique in this demo.
This article explores how font size adjustments are implemented in the Next.js and Nuxt.js frameworks to generate the fallback font CSS and reduce the CLS. It also demon…</p>

          <p>I&#x27;ve got many, many USB A to USB micro cables and I still have a good number of devices that make use of the micro connection.
The USB (2) port generally have four wires - ground, power and then D+ and D- (for data exchange). USB micro has a 5th line, though when it&#x27;s connected to USB A on the other side that 5th line isn&#x27;t connected.
My problem is that I also have a boat load of power only USB cables - and there&#x27;s no way to tell using a visual inspection. You can buy tools that tell you if there&#x27;s a data line, but I can make one fairly simply.

I should caveat this with the fact that I just happened to have the parts laying around.
In short
The device is an LED power a battery power source and the USB&#x27;s data wire is used to complete the circuit.
Parts

Protoboard
USB A port
USB micro port
LED
220ohm (ish) resistor
Battery (I used a game boy cartridge battery - again I had them laying around)

Wiring
In my version, I&#x27;ve included separate LEDs and checks for both the D+ and the D- but it&#x27;s not really necessary - if D+ isn&#x27;t there, neither is D-.
The pinout on the USB ports is the important detail, the outside pins (far left and far right) are VCC and ground (which we don&#x27;t care about). The centre pins are what we&#x27;re interested in. The centre pins will make up the circuit.

Result
Now I have a simple tool that can help me weed out those pesky power-only USB cables!</p>

          <p>Just wondering similar to STAFF tag (or blue tick from Twitter) it would be great if there was an icon added to mention that this account/organisation was using U2F security. This will strengthen the trust on the repo.
What do you all think?

If you do end up trying out bearclaw, you can use nginx or your favorite webserver. Earlier this week I made eclaire - a static site webserver with compression, caching, and automatic HTTPS through letsencrypt. https://github.com/donuts-are-good/eclaire

          <p>As we continue to face difficult choices and work to make things better, it’s quite likely that the alternatives being presented aren’t ideal or even appealing. Many organizations and communities are stuck because “none of the above” is the majority’s opinion, or perhaps the desire of those in power, or those with loud voices. But unless you’re willing to acknowledge that you’re simply being difficult, “none of the above” comes with the responsibility to describe a path that’s better. Because forward is the best option. Let’s go with one that makes the most sense–and if you don’t have a better […]</p>

          <p>Just going through the backlog of some old projects and found this Filament Group gem that went unpublished!
Flex Luthor is a small CSS wrapper library to help with responsive intrinsic-sized Flexbox layouts that wrap based on content and container width (avoiding viewport-based media queries).
Demo
Source Code
This library predated Flexbox support for the gap property but I updated it to use gap in the new v3.0.0 version. I think the coolest feature it provides is the addition of borders only when cells wrap to a new line (horizontal, vertical, or both).
Install #
Available on npm

          <p>Hey,
… And I’m back in town your inbox with quite a few new reading recommendations for you. It’s quite interesting how the web continues to bring new stuff each week, how developers explore these new things. A lot of the CSS features we currently get make using CSS easier, make a property’s purpose clearer and some reduce selector complexity (always a good goal). Other ones enable complete new product ideas, especially in the JavaScript API field, and others disrupt the current status quo of building web apps (Page Transitions API, SPAs and MPAs).
For a short time, I’ll be changing my usual monthly publishing routine. The current issue started with over seventy links that are worth including. So I’ll start with a smaller list and you will likely get the next edition next week already. Whe…</p>

          <p>Edge just showed me a (huge) ad within the browser UI (between the address bar and web view):
&gt; Take your AI-powered copilot for the web on the go! Download Microsoft Edge on your mobile device to sign-up and get ready for the new Bing experience!
This is especially irritating because there&#x27;s no reason to show me this ad--I already use Edge as my primary browser on mobile (because the latest iOS update made Safari start losing its scroll position when going back to a previous page).
Between this and the frequent repinning of an Edge icon to my Windows desktop (every single update), I&#x27;m fairly annoyed.
Does FireFox do this kind of annoying stuff? Is there another browser I should try?
Edit: I&#x27;ve seen small &quot;ads&quot; before in Edge (like &quot;try this new feature&quot; or &quot;oh no, please don&#x27;t install Chrome&quot;), but never just a literal huge banner ad.

However, the containment spec includes more than just size queries; it also enables querying a parent&#x27;s style values. From Chromium 111, you’ll be able to apply style containment for custom property values and query a parent element for the value of a custom property.
This means that we have even more logical control of styles in CSS, and enables  better separation of an application’s logic and data layer from its styles.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34912315 target="_blank">Ask HN: How do you research system design paradigms?</a>
          <p>I feel like I often find myself wondering &quot;How do other people do this?&quot; when I need to solve some larger system design question. This usually leads to Google, which usually leads to a bunch of ads. Sorting through this is not the best experience.
Stack Overflow is also sort of subpar for these sorts of questions - as its short form, and frankly just doesn&#x27;t contain much of the content I&#x27;m looking for.
I think I&#x27;d love a mostly-correct ChatGPT modeled as a system design expert. The current iteration seems kinda shallow, unless my prompts just suck.
How do other people go about doing this research?

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34914897 target="_blank">Ask HN: A fast, Rust HTML parser that works?</a>
          <p>So I&#x27;m doing some web scraping in Rust, and so I will need to parse HTML. [scraper](https://docs.rs/scraper/latest/scraper/) (which uses [html5ever](https://github.com/servo/html5ever)) is doing fine except that it&#x27;s the bottleneck of my application.
So I need a faster parser. I&#x27;ve tried [tl](https://docs.rs/tl/latest/tl/) which would&#x27;ve been perfect except that it doesn&#x27;t actually work on the HTML I have. When I try to &#x60;query_selector&#x60; the elements I need, it returns nothing.
[Kuchiki](https://docs.rs/kuchiki/latest/kuchiki/) is abandonded.
I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get [lol-html](https://github.com/cloudflare/lol-html) to work for me (it&#x27;s designed for re-writing HTML, whatever that means). It doesn&#x27;t seem to have an API to extract the inner text of an element.
[html5gum](https://github.com/untitaker/html5gum) seems to be just an HTML tokenizer, or otherwise just too low-level. I have not yet tried [quick-xml](https://github.com/tafia/quick-xml/) but judging from the README, it&#x27;s pretty low-level too. I mean, if these are the only options left then I will try them. Otherwise, I would love to use a parser that&#x27;s faster but as ergonomic as &#x60;scraper&#x60; or &#x60;tl&#x60;.
At this point, I would be happy with an Lxml bridge/port of some sort. I don&#x27;t need to mutate HTML, just parse and read data from it.

If YouTube or the Wayback Machine shows us that it happened after 2022, bring some doubt. AI and digital cools can produce a perfect voiceover, edit a video, forge a document… There have always been forces at work that prize disrupting our civic systems.

          <p>Have you ever applied CSS to an element but it just doesn&#x27;t work?
With Chrome DevTools, you can discover CSS issues at a glance, debug, and test them.


Watch the video to learn how the Elements &gt; Styles pane highlights various CSS issues:
 Property with invalid syntax
 Overridden property
 Inactive property 
Inherited from parent
 Inherited property
 Non-inherited property
 Expandable shorthand property 
 Overridden longhand property
 Active longhand property
user agent stylesheet
Non-editable property
Overridden non-editable property
More debugging tips:
Use the filter in the Styles pane to focus on the one property that interests you.
Use the Computed pane to see all the Cascade winners and their computed values.
In the Computed pane, expand a property and click a link to find its source in the Styles pane.
To learn more about all the ways DevTools highlights CSS issues, see Find invalid, overridden, inactive, and other CSS.

          <a href=https://github.com/btahir/nextail-companies target="_blank">Show HN: List of Companies That Use Next.js and Tailwind CSS</a>
          <p>I love the stack and am curating a list for myself in case I ever want to apply for jobs.
Companies using Tailwind in particular attract me because they tend to have the same build fast mindset I have so its also an indirect filter for culture. What do you think?
Also - If you can think of any cool companies using Next/Tailwind/Both please do comment/PR. :)
Note: I am trying to only add companies that are early stage/ startups and use it for their main product (one off web pages don&#x27;t count)

          <p>Hey, guys. I&#x27;ve just made a plugin which turns your pandas dataframe into a tableau-style component. It allows you to explore the dataframe with easy drag-and-drop UI.
You can use PyGWalker in Jupyter, Google Colab, or even Kaggle Notebook to easily explore your data and generate interactive visualizations.
PyGWalker (pronounced like &quot;Pig Walker&quot;, just for fun) is named as an abbreviation of &quot;Python binding of Graphic Walker&quot;.
Here are some links to check it out:
The Github Repo: https://github.com/Kanaries/pygwalker
Use PyGWalker in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/asmdef/pygwalker-test
Feedback and suggestions are appreciated! Please feel free to try it out and let me know what you think. Thanks for your support!

          <a href=https://daverupert.com/2023/02/internet-has-broken-gift-giving/ target="_blank">The internet has broken gift giving</a>
          <p>My wife and I did a poor job sharing Christmas wishlists with each other this year. It dawned on us how our hobbies (hers tennis, mine gunpla) are so specialized we either A) have the stuff we need or B) our needs are so specific or subjective that even gifting a ballpark guess of what the person wants doesn’t actually help and would probably create more work.
SungWon Cho (aka, ProZD) sums the situation up perfectly in his short bit “before and after you discover the subreddit for a hobby”…

The Reddit-ification of hobbies is real. Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok are waiting to rapture you and radicalize your innocent hobbies. And the more niche your needs become, the more expensive as well. The internet has obliterated the $20 casual gift. It’s $400+ or GTFO.
So we text each other links of an exact item, the stock counts of rare item across 20 sites, the exact time window the of the group buy, but ugchk, you’d need my login so that it’s tied to my account, so how about you just Venmo me $400 instead from our shared bank account?
We’ve cut the sails of gift giving. Online wishlists try to meet this need, but are always out of date, so you need to nudge the person to update their wishlist, spoiling the surprise, so that you can buy the first item at the top that meets your budget.
And the immediacy of Amazon Prime has ruined the suspense of gift giving. Why wait a month for something when I could have it in two days with free returns? The idea of a gift giving holiday reeks of an old world activity like reeling film through a projector to watch a movie with no sound. The immense effort for a demonstrative show of attention on a pre-planned day.
So that’s my take, the internet has ruined gift giving. The only safe gift going forward is homemade bread from your pandemic bread hobby. But be sure the yeast is single-sourced and stored at precisely 45ºF like its hometown in the mountains of Bavaria.</p>

          <p>It’s a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.
Read more about RSS Club.

I don’t talk about this much, but since February 24th, 2022 I’ve spent ~2hrs a day following the war in Ukraine. My heart breaks and sensitivities to injustice rise over this David vs. Goliath scenario where greedy authoritarians bomb peaceful civilians indiscriminately.
Ukraine has fought valiantly over the past year. Their cities and infrastructure decimated. Their homes and apartment complexes the targets of expensive cruise missiles. Mass devastation for what? The Russian government lies to its citizens and punishes them for seeking or speaking the truth. The government-sponsored media says its “necessary”, propaganda about “nazism”, manipulation over “satanism” and overt xenophobia, leaving yo…</p>

          <p>I had a free night on the calendar, so I tumbled out of my office with a stack of necessary supplies: a laptop in case I wanted to blog (or work more), my iPad in case I wanted to watch YouTubes, a gunpla set and all my tools in case I wanted to hobby, and a book or two in case I wanted to read. I got in the house and let out a sigh “What am I doing?!” I wish I could say this was an isolated event, but it happens often. The likelihood I do any of these activities beyond my iPad is miniscule.
Carrying that pile of distractions, my brain flashed back to college. Living in an enormous house with seven roommates and at least one freeloading vagrant, I was paying $200/mo in rent to sleep in a literal closet in South Austin. To focus, I’d leave the house and walk over to the coffee shop: Bouldin…</p>

          <p>Hi HN,
nudedisco is a simple album discovery tool I created to aggregate album reviews from a number of my favourite websites and blogs.
As someone who spends most of his professional life working with React and &quot;modern&quot; frontend stacks, it was a lot of fun to go back to basics and create a server-rendered website.
The site uses Elixir under the hood and is deployed to fly.io.
The code is available on my GitHub profile: https://github.com/soulprovidr/nudedisco
If you have any thoughts or suggestions, I&#x27;d love to hear them.
Thanks, and enjoy!

          <p>Hi HN. I&#x27;ve been working on a new browser-based design tool that&#x27;s ready for you to try.
The idea is you work on your design in low fidelity wireframes, while still getting a high fidelity output that you can share or use as a reference for your implementation. The way it works is by mapping low fidelity blocks you draw into high fidelity design system &amp; React components.
I spent several years working on design tools at companies like Airbnb, and I think the ideas behind many of the tools we built for designing at scale could really help startups and small teams as well. I would love any feedback you have!
PS: Most of Noya is open source at https://github.com/noya-app/noya

          <p>Perhaps these might make a great game more fun: Maximize total score: Exactly the same rules as regular Scrabble, but focus on increasing the total score of all players instead of defeating the others. It’s subtle, it can be challenging for a good player, and it creates more magic and opportunity for everyone. Keep it […]</p>

          <p>I am a big fan and user of Font Awesome icons. Although their search function is pretty neat, sometimes I find it difficult to search for icons related to a particular concept or topic.
As a solution, I have created an app where you can enter any concept or topic and receive the corresponding Font Awesome icon code. Here is an example for the word &quot;prediction&quot;:
When I searched for &quot;prediction&quot; using Font Awesome&#x27;s search, no icons were returned: https://fontawesome.com/search?q&#x3D;prediction&amp;o&#x3D;r
However, the app suggested that I should use the &quot;chart-line&quot; icon, which was accurate: https://cookup.ai/o/prediction-font-awesome-icon-picker-usin...
Please try it out and let me know your feedback.

          <p>In case you missed it, container queries landed in all stable browsers this week! It’s a pretty exciting time to be working with CSS, seeing this long-awaited feature finally become useable.
Una’s post on web.dev includes a rundown of how to use container queries, as well as some nifty demos. By coincidence, I’ve also been editing a soon-to-be-published article by Stephanie on container queries, which also includes some rather lovely demos. Something I’ve noticed about both sets of demos is that they make use of the resize CSS property to create a resizeable area within the document, rather than relying on the user having to resize their entire viewport to see the container queries in action.

          <a href=https://remysharp.com/til/javascript/use-effect-async-swallows target="_blank">React&#x27;s useEffect swallows async errors [til/javascript]</a>
          <p>I don&#x27;t particularly use this pattern, but I ran across it recently and it took me a while to work out what was happening (it does make sense if you think about it, but running through code it&#x27;s not easy to spot).
In the following example you won&#x27;t see any errors nor any logging.
useEffect(() &#x3D;&gt; {
  const test &#x3D; async &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {
    someFunctionThatThrows();
    console.log(&quot;sid&quot;);
  };

  try {
    test();
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(&quot;sam&quot;);
  }
}, []);

It needs to either change to to explicitly catches (which I tend to prefer because it feels explicit) or a try catch inside the async:
useEffect(() &#x3D;&gt; {
  const test &#x3D; async &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {
    try {
      someFunctionThatThrows();
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(e);
    }
    console.log(&quot;test has finished&quot;);
  };

  test();
}, []);

Or, which covers more cases:
useEffect(() &#x3D;&gt; {
  const test &#x3D; async &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {
    someFunctionThatThrows();
    console.log(&quot;test has finished&quot;);
  };

  test().catch(e &#x3D;&gt; console.error(e));
}, []);</p>

          <p>Hi HN, question in the subject really.
I am a former UI guy that moved out into a management role years ago, however I am hopping back in to manage the user experience with a fairly large and widely used application. I&#x27;ve kept my hand in with products like Adobe XD and Figma, however I&#x27;m curious to know what HN considers the go to tools are these days?
I have a fairly large job on my hands, the application has grown a little wild over the years, so need to bring it all into order.
Appreciate any advice you may have.

# Debugging HD color with the Styles pane
New CSS color types and spaces are coming to the web! It is equally exciting that DevTools introduced new tools to help developers create, convert and debug High Definition color.
The Styles pane now supports 12 new color spaces and 7 new gamuts as outlined in the CSS Color Level 4 specification. See High Definition CSS Color Guide for a comprehensive understanding of color options available on the web.
Here are examples of CSS color definitions with color(), lch(), oklab() and color-mix().

When using the color-mix() function, you can view the final color output in the Computed pane.

The color picker supports all the new color s…</p>

          <p>I frequently find myself in a cycle where I’m switching between phases of “Feature Work” and “Maintenance Work”. Sometimes the cycle is morning-to-afternoon, sometimes weekstart-to-weekend, sometimes week-to-week, sometimes month-to-month. I don’t think this is unique so much as I have noticed that these two different phases require different mindsets —an almost entirely different brain— and have different outcomes and rewards systems. I’ve tried to sum it up in this in a table.

Feature Work
Maintenance Work




Speed
Slower
Faster


Scope
Large-scale greenfield work
Isolated changes


Depth
Mostly deep work
Mostly shallow tasks


Quantity
Massive number of big changes and cascading issues
Many small changes


Autonomy
Low, many stakeholders
High, few stakeholders


Risk

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34800598 target="_blank">Ask HN: How do you maintain daily productivity in a non-structured setting?</a>
          <p>Suppose you are not in college or school with structured classes and exams or not in a typical job. Maybe you own your own business (whichever kind), or doing research in grad school, or some other thing where there is no external force to structure out your day.
How do you maintain productivity and get things done? How do you not wander off the internet rabbit hole? I am not talking about toxic patterns like studying 12 hrs a day and live streaming it. I am talking about getting real work done by working in a sane way.
Suppose you have taken a year break to prepare for some entrance exam and are self studying subjects on your own. Rather than sitting in front of your books all day and creating anxiety and bad habits (burning out), how do you manage to find time for all things in a healthy way and get things done in every aspect of life?

          <p>Picture it: you turn on your computer for the day and see your inbox flooded with requests. Your desk is littered with sticky notes, to-do lists, and random scribbled-down thoughts. Some of your clients have sent feedback, others have revision requests, you have new designs to start, and you can’t remember at all what’s happening with that huge ongoing design project you’re working on. Then, you realize there’s a big deadline today you completely forgot about. You’ve been ‘working’ for just a few minutes, and you’re already frazzled and stressed.
Now let’s set another scene — one that’s a bit less overwhelming.
You settle in at your desk with your favorite beverage (perhaps a chai latte?). When you open your computer to start your work day, you already have a plan. You check for updates on…</p>

There are many different ways of using colour informatively when it comes to data visualization. But we also need to ensure our use of colour conveys the right information, and that it is used accessibly. In this article we’ll walk through some examples of using colour in different types of visualizations with the data visualization library D3.js. Some familiarity with D3 will be assumed, but there will be some helpful pointers regardless of how you create your visualizations.
Is colour the best option?
Colour can be extremely useful in conveying meaning in our designs. It can also be difficult to get right, and in the worst case could have a negative impact on the user experience. Some colour comb…</p>

          <p>Hi! I&#x27;m currently writing UI test using selenium. 
Is there a product that can write UI test automatically just by &#x27;recording&#x27; what I&#x27;ve done in manual test? Like a macro recorder in excel.
I&#x27;m thinking like a browser extension then I can set a test scenario like this is for product checkout. Then I will click &#x27;record test&#x27; then I will proceed to do a manual test in checkout page until completion. Then I will stop &#x27;record test&#x27; and save it. 
Ofcourse it would be great If I can set predefined parameters for input.
I will add those recorded tests in our ci/cd pipeline and done.

          <p>In my RSS apps, the top HN feed has always shown a page with a link to view comments. Alas trying out Readwise Reader which is amazing but a bug where feeds like HN, DF etc go straight to the external url bypassing the commentary content which is why most of us subscribe to these wildly popular feeds. In meantime, is there a top HN rss feed that just includes the HN links and not the external links so will work in rss reader that can’t handle it normally yet?

          <p>Performance management processes have been different at every company I’ve worked in, ranging from “basically non-existent” at a 15 person startup to “months of work for managers each review period followed by clear expectations that growth feedback will be given throughout the year” in big tech world.  Some of these differences are good and bad, most are more about the context of the company.  I’ve found that regardless of process there are 4 things that it’s important for a team member to align with their manager on throughout the year.  Hopefully there’s process supporting this, but if not both the team member or the manager can take the initiative to make it happen.
Focus - Where should the teammate be putting their energy?  Depending on seniority and the level of change within the org…</p>

          <a href=https://www.zachleat.com/web/chromium-missing/ target="_blank">&#x27;Could not find Chromium&#x27; with Puppeteer 19</a>
          <p>Kept seeing this error on my Netlify builds of the Speedlify project after upgrading to Puppeteer 19:
/opt/build/repo/node_modules/puppeteer-core/lib/cjs/puppeteer/node/ProductLauncher.js:127
Error: Could not find Chromium (rev. 1095492). This can occur if either
 1. you did not perform an installation before running the script (e.g. &#x60;npm install&#x60;) or
 2. your cache path is incorrectly configured (which is: /opt/buildhome/.cache/puppeteer).
For (2), check out our guide on configuring puppeteer at https://pptr.dev/guides/configuration.
With Puppeteer 19, the Chromium download has been moved to a new folder: ~/.cache/puppeteer (on Netlify this is /opt/buildhome/.cache/puppeteer/).
The problem here is that Puppeteer only downloads Chromium when it is installed and the folder it downloads to is outside of the expected and previously working folders that Netlify persists across builds (like node_modules).
The solution here is to either move this Chromium download folder to a location that does get persisted (via PUPPETEER_CACHE_DIR environment variable or a puppeteer.config.cjs config file) or persist it yourself via a Netlify build plugin.
I chose the latter. The netlify-plugin-cache build plugin will probably do this for you, but its so few lines of code that I used my own:
Expand to see the keep-data-cache Netlify build plugin
// speedlify/plugins/keep-data-cache/index.js
module.exports &#x3D; {
  async onPreBuild({ utils }) {
    await utils.cache.restore(&#x27;/opt/buildhome/.cache/puppeteer/&#x27;);
  },
  async onPostBuild({ utils }) {
    await utils.cache.save(&#x27;/opt/buildhome/.cache/puppeteer/&#x27;);
  }
};
which is referenced in my netlify.toml:
# netlify.toml
[[plugins]]
package &#x3D; &quot;./plugins/keep-data-cache&quot;
You can see this in action on the speedlify project.
After applying this change, make sure you force Netlify to reinstall your node_modules by clearing the build cache or changing a dependency version in your package.json.</p>

          <p>One day my friend Bryan told me to come look at something on his computer. I respected Bryan, he was a bit older, and his opinions always weighed heavily on me. This seemed urgent, so I shuffled in his office as quick as I could.
On the screen was a grey’ish looking website. Bryan made websites. I made websites. We had that in common. And playing guitar. He looked me in the eyes and said “This is Flex. It’s the future of websites and you need to learn it.”  And from what he was showing me, I was impressed and astounded. A fully rich internet application. XML-powered tables and lists with sorting and animations that you’d spend months building in Flash. I had never seen anything this professional before.

Flex was the successor to Flash. Or a better way to put it, Flex was Flash but for app…</p>

          <p>Is there an (easy|simple|sane) [pick one from 3] way to automate animation tests that include User Interaction?
I ask because earlier this evening I deployed an update/NPM version bump of my Canvas library, after spending much of the day reviewing all the demo tests in various browsers on various devices. Only to watch as the new version broke the library&#x27;s associated website&#x27;s build tools. A stupid bug (2 chars) which meant having to fix it, test essential demos in various browsers etc before doing another release on GitHub and publishing the new version on NPM.
I know this process can be easier. But the thing that holds me back from automating the heck out of my test/release process is that I&#x27;m clueless about how to test the library&#x27;s functionality. It&#x27;s a library to make working with 2D Canvas elements &quot;more fun&quot;, so I test manually because I need to *see* that things - in particular animations - are working as I expect them to work.
The test suite is here: https://scrawl-v8.rikweb.org.uk/demo/index.html
Any advice is really welcome!

          <p>Like most people here, I&#x27;ve always worked with a computer in front of me. But I just had a dream that I was working while lying on my back, with my computer above me, screen looking down.
One could also imagine a setup where you&#x27;re lying on your side and facing a monitor, keyboard and mouse setup rotated 90 degrees, although how you would make the k+m stay in this position is the question.
Have you ever experimented with such unconventional work setups?

          <p>Performance management processes have been different at every company I’ve worked in, ranging from “basically non-existent” at a 15 person startup to “months of work for managers each review period followed by clear expectations that growth feedback will be given throughout the year” in big tech world.  Some of these differences are good and bad, most are more about the context of the company.  I’ve found that regardless of process there are 4 things that it’s important for a team member to align with their manager on throughout the year.  Hopefully there’s process supporting this, but if not both the team member or the manager can take the initiative to make it happen.
Focus - Where should the teammate be putting their energy?  Depending on seniority and the level of change within the org…</p>

          <p>I have used rudimentary scrapers for years but always found that the process of training them doesn’t scale as well as I expect. In a scenario where one needs hundreds of scrapers all grabbing the same five or 10 pieces of information (dates, names, addresses, and ID numbers) is it possible to just grab the raw HTML and train an NLP model to find the relevant data rather than selecting specific selectors/paths?
It seems to me that finding these items in an HTML doc would be a trivial task for NLP and this would allow us to forgo scraper maintenance in the event that websites change. Assuming that I already have hundreds of thousands or millions of records in structured data that could be used for training, would modern tools make this a more efficient way of ingesting data?

          <p>Earlier this month, I got the chance to join Kevin Powell on his livestream to talk Web Components. Kevin is one of my favorite web development content creators. His style is approachable and beginner friendly. If you’re getting started with web development or want to improve your HTML and CSS chops, I highly recommend you like and subscribe.
Kevin is like other talented web developers I know; knows about Web Components but hasn’t dug in and used them yet. We follow my course guidebook, starting with HTML → moving on to CSS → and then start to get into JavaScript towards the end but we ran out of time to go super deep on that topic. If you liked this livestream or want to know more about writing Web Components or building systems with Web Components, there’s more in my Frontend Masters course.</p>

          <p>An unusually warm Texas January; 70ºF days, cool nights, my son had baseball try-outs, then…
On the last day of January, a horrific ice storm hit Central Texas. My house lost power and internet on Wednesday morning as thick tree limbs snapped under the weight of ice, taking out power lines and transformers on their journey to the ground. Hurricane-like devastation. We took refuge at a friend’s house who had power, then lost power, but had a backup generator. I went back and forth to the house to saw branches and sleep with the animals in our cold, powerless house. In total, 125 hours without power, beating out the previous record of 75 hours set in 2021.
Last week brought up a lot of trauma from the 2021 Freeze. My wife and I wonder how much of the off-grid prepper lifestyle we need to ado…</p>

          <a href=https://feedgrid.io/ target="_blank">Show HN: Feedgrid.io- RSS reader with a grid UI for serious infotainment junkies</a>
          <p>What:
Feedgrid is a news aggregator for RSS and Atom feeds.
It lets you organize your feeds into related topics and view feed items in 2-dimensional grids, rather than a single infinite scroll column.
The goal is to have a highly configurable tool to organize diverse feeds in a visual way, and then easily check for new content with a bird&#x27;s eye view.
Why:
- there’s a lot of stuff on the web, but you want it in 1 place, organized by categories that make sense to you
- RSS is nice in principle but most readers feel like an overloaded email inbox (i.e. kinda stressful—you already have other inboxes to deal with..)
- you like breadth-first search rather than depth-first search when you’re on the john and looking for some infotainment, but TikTok is frenetic and unsettling to you because you still like reading
How:
- we’re running a Django app with some minimal js in the frontend, and serve grid pages as a modest-sized html blob with enough content for one sitting, and offer old-school pagination to get more content
- the backend web scraping is entirely separate from the server, and uses scrapy. Scrapers are deployed on VMs, launching scrapy crawler instances dynamically based on feed SLA data in the db; there is no “scheduler”, but rather long-running parent coordinators launching child subprocesses as needed, so SLAs (and other attributes) can be modified by site admins without touching spiders

          <p>Hey HN,
I’d like to introduce, our app, Mockup - the ideal design tool for sketching and creating blueprints for apps or web designs.
One of my end goals is to make the design process easy and intuitive and that&#x27;s exactly what Mockup does with its 45+ templates, flexible canvas, Library to save your elements, and a range of other attributes. With features like the Lasso tool, text and image insertion, 4000 symbols from Apple&#x27;s SF Symbols library, and a customizable grid, your design possibilities are endless.
And, the best part? I&#x27;ve just released a brand new update, packed with features suggested by our users to make the design experience even better like arrange objects, copy &amp; paste, and an enhanced toolbar. Not to mention, users can now publish their elements to the community and access elements created by others as well as create UI  for TV apps with the highly requested newly added TV template.
I can&#x27;t wait for you to try it out!

          <p>I&#x27;m a web developer who has been in the market for a new job for a while now.  As someone who has never enjoyed working with frontend JS frameworks (yes, I sucked it up and learned them and have worked with them professionally) I&#x27;m wondering who all the companies are who have embraced the semi-recent &quot;HTML over the wire&quot; movement (Can you imagine... using hyper text transfer protocol for transferring hyper text?  Seems nuts, I know).  It&#x27;s a massive slog shifting through endless React/Vue/etc-focused jobs out there.  Even if you use React in small areas where it pulls its weight but generally try and stick to simplicity of sending plain ol&#x27; HTML, I&#x27;d love to know who you are.  Even if you aren&#x27;t hiring, it&#x27;s nice knowing you&#x27;re out there fighting the good fight :)

          <p># Summary
This article is a deep dive into font fallbacks and the size-adjust, ascent-override, descent-override, and line-gap-override APIs. These APIs make it possible to use local fonts to create fallback font faces that closely or exactly match the dimensions of a web font. This reduces or eliminates layout shifts caused by font swapping.
If you’d prefer to skip reading this article, these are some of the tools that you can use to start using these APIs immediately:
Framework tools:
@next/font: Starting in Next 13, next/font automatically uses font metric overrides and size-adjust to provide matching font fallbacks.
@nuxtjs/fontaine: Starting in Nuxt 3, you can use nuxt/fontaine to automatically generate and insert matching font fallbacks into the stylesheets used by your Nuxt app.

Quite significantly as compared to the year prior.
It&#x27;s a crude metric and probably actually measures activity vs productivity. So... has productivity / activity increased at your company over the last few months?

          <p>Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve made a chrome extension that makes designing and building Tailwind websites much simpler and faster.
It let&#x27;s you quickly tweak your website right inside the browser and copy back classes or html to your editor afterwards. As a developer who designs with code, I personally find it very useful in iterating on design quickly without any context switching.
Please give it a try and let me know what you think!

          <p>We recently wrote about the guiding principles that we’ve been using to help us make decisions about what improvements we want to make to WebPageTest.
One example of a feature that was driven by these principles are the Simple Test Configurations that we rolled out last January.

I wanted to walk through that change, why we made it, and what the results are because it’s a good example of how those principles guide our work and what goes into what, on the surface, was a very simple addition.
The historical default
Prior to adding our simple test configurations, the default test settings for WebPageTest were to run a test on
Chrome
On a Desktop
Over a Cable connection
From Virginia
Defaults matter a lot. As a result of this default, this test configuration was our most popular setting, accou…</p>

Lighthouse 10 is available immediately on the command line through npm, in Chrome Canary, and in PageSpeed Insights. It will land in Chrome stable in Chrome 112.
# Scoring changes
The venerable Time To Interactive (TTI) metric is being removed in Lighthouse 10, with its 10% score weight shifted to Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), which will now account for 25% of the overall performance score. Ideally this change will increase focus on CLS for sites that still need fixes for unnecessary layout shifts.
We expect this to improve most pages&#x27; performance scores, since most pages tend to score better on CLS than TTI. In an analysis of 13 million page loads …</p>

The Bidding and Auction services integrate with existing FLEDGE designs and offload bid computation and scoring to a cloud-based trusted execution environment. This was proposed back in 2022 and, after careful consideration, both Chrome and Android plan to provide support for Bidding and Auction services.
We will continue to support on-device auctions, and the use of the Bidding and Auction Services is not required unless it fits your use cases.
Our goal is to minimize the effort to test and deploy Bidding and Auction services…</p>

          <p>Lately I have been learning Jetpack Compose (for Android). Its new and shiny, like its counterpart SwiftUI (Apple), but there are older frameworks that take this approach, like React.
The main problem being solved, according to the marketing materials, is that its easier to keep state in sync with UI by regenerating the UI as state changes. Lots of work goes into avoiding updating the tree of UI that hasn&#x27;t changed. This sounds good.
Is the declarative approach the way forward for all 2d UIs (even outside mobile)? Is there still merit with the older approach of stateful widget trees and mutating their state imperatively? Where will we see the traditional (imperative) way maintain its niche compared to declarative UIs?
