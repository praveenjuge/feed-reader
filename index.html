          <p>Hi HN,
Long story short - I&#x27;m looking around to see if there are any job boards that would be focused on finding UX people.
My friend has a degree in architecture, she was working for quite a few years in variety of building design shops. At some point in her life she moved to suburbs and had children, took a few years off to care for them. Now kids are in school and she is looking to go back to work life, she is craving for interaction with people. She decided to pivot her career and do UX since it is something she is familiar with from her previous jobs, the reason for doing this is that where she lives it would take her roughly 2 hours driving to get to the city and her previous industry is not very remote-friendly.
She is trying to get hired as junior UX, however with no success. It had been a couple of months now and she is reaching the point of being depressed for being rejected from every place shy is applying to. I have no experience with UX to give her advice on making her first steps.
I know it&#x27;s probably not the best time for juniors but life likes to write scenarios with no regard to economic situation... so any advice would be highly appreciated :)

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32687949 target="_blank">Ask HN: What do you use as the “internal admin UI”?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;ve been building products for many years and, most of the time, my &quot;admin UI&quot; would be some SQL GUI (currently Adminer with a custom plugin).
That&#x27;s what I&#x27;d use to resolve support cases, change some data for the customers when it&#x27;s absent from the real UI, etc.
Usually, there&#x27;s just no time to build internal admin apps when you&#x27;re a solo founder or a small team.
However, I&#x27;m not really happy with this way of doing things. There&#x27;s no &quot;global search&quot;, no place to attach notes, and often it&#x27;s hard to jump to related records (e.g. client -&gt; client&#x27;s transactions) quickly.
As I&#x27;d run the SQL GUI locally, it&#x27;s always hard to share links to some records with my team, other than in the form of screenshots.
The list of problems goes on and on.
-----
Hence it prompted this question. What do you use? How do you debug data issues? How do you help customers? How do you share links (whatever form they take) to data with your team and collaborate?

          <p>HtDP teaches mainly functional programming. But the real world still uses imperative programming majorly.
Those who used HtDP as a first resource to get into programming what did they use to learn imperative programming and then other subjects of CS like data structures and algorithms?
Or is it better to use HtDP after you have already programmed using bad style in an imperative language?

Often, we show up with our cheese and then become indignant when the mouse does what mice do. “Oh, you’re a mouse.” […]</p>

          <p>To improve privacy, Chrome is changing how storage and communication APIs will
behave in future releases. Read more about the upcoming change in
Storage Partitioning.
The initial implementation has been available behind a flag in Chrome 105,
since July 2022. Starting in Chrome Beta 106, from September 2022, the new
implementation (which includes Cache Storage partitioning) is available for
testing. The latest features and bug fixes will land in Chrome Canary first, so
consider using Canary for continued testing.
This change should not affect the most common use cases where your app only
uses storage in a first-party context, but we recommend testing to ensure that
your applications will continue to work as they do today. If you interact with,
or rely on storage in iframes, there&#x27;s a higher…</p>

          <p>Federated Credential Management API (FedCM)
is a web API for privacy-preserving identity federation. With identity
federation, an RP (relying party) relies on an IdP (identity provider) to
provide the user an account without requiring a new username and password.
FedCM is a purpose-built API that allows the browser to understand the context
in which the RP and IdP exchange information, inform the user as to the
information and privilege levels being shared and prevent unintended abuse.
FedCM origin trial began in Chrome 101 on Android and Chrome 103 on desktop. It
was initially scheduled to end in version 105. Based on feedback, the API has
undergone changes, so to give developers more time to test the new
implementation and syntax, the origin trial has been extended.
FedCM origin trial will now be available until the release of Chrome 108,
scheduled for November 23, 2022.

          <p>Chrome DevTools makes debugging CSS flexbox layouts intuitive. The Elements panel provides you with a context-aware Flexbox Editor and customizable overlay.


Watch the video to learn how to:
Use the Flexbox Editor to change flexbox properties with a click of a button instead of typing them.
Toggle the flexbox overlay in the viewport to see the changes you make right away.
Use the Elements &gt; Layout &gt; Flexbox section to see a list of all elements and locate them in the DOM tree. Additionally, you can customize the overlay colors here.
To learn more about CSS flexbox in general, see Learn CSS &gt; Flexbox.
For a more hands-on debugging experience in DevTools, follow the Inspect and debug CSS flexbox layouts tutorial.</p>

# Remove non-ASCII characters in cookie domain attributes
To align with the latest spec (RFC 6265bis), Chromium now rejects cookies with a Domain attribute that contains non-ASCII characters (for example, éxample.com).
Support for IDN domain attributes in cookies has been long unspecified, with Chromium, Safari, and Firefox all behaving differently. This change standardizes Firefox&#x27;s behavior of rejecting cookies with non-ASCII domain attributes.
Since Chromium has previously accepted non-ASCII characters and tried to convert them to normalized punycode for storage, we will now apply stricter …</p>

          <p># Why we need COEP
Some web APIs increase the risk of side-channel attacks such as
Spectre. To
mitigate that risk, browsers offer an opt-in-based isolated environment called
cross-origin isolation, which, among other things,
requires deploying COEP. This allows websites to use privileged features
including
SharedArrayBuffer,
performance.measureUserAgentSpecificMemory(),
and
high-precision timers with better resolution.
To enable cross-origin isolation, websites must send the following two HTTP
headers:
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
COEP:credentialless can also be used as an alternative to require-corp.
# Challenges with enabling COEP
While cross-origin isolation brings webpages better security and the ability to
enable powerful features,…</p>

          <p>The service I am building is usage-based, i.e.
  * I am charging per second the service was used, e.g. USD 0.01/second
  * I would like to give credits upon sign-up.
  * There is no monthly minimum.

  * &#x60;billing_account (id, billing_rate_id, running_balance)&#x60;
  * &#x60;billing_rate (id, rate)&#x60;
  * &#x60;account_credit (id, billing_account_id, timestamp, amount, function_execution_id)&#x60;
  * &#x60;account_debit (id, billing_account_id, timestamp, amount, source [platform_credit or stripe])&#x60;

Then whenever they run a function that costs them, I create &#x60;account_credit&#x60; account with an entry equal to the amount they spent and update &#x60;billing_account&#x60; &#x60;running_balance&#x60; value.
When they top-up their account, I would just add entry to &#x60;account_debit&#x60; and update the balance again.
This appears to cover all my use cases, but I wanted to check with anyone who&#x27;s designed such database schemas before.

I once thought of contacting one of those manufacturer of the Photo Frames and ask them if they can do the necessary tweaks. But I&#x27;m not sure what details to give them.
What is the prep work necessary for this? I&#x27;ve absolutely no idea where to start but it&#x27;s one of the project ideas that I come back to again and again and want to get it done no matter what.
Where do I even start at this? Any pointers would help tremendously.

There is class support but I am still working on it along with some other cool features. Feedback is appreciated.

          <p>Hey,
Let&#x27;s build websites for every one of us: »At the end of 2021, approximately 7.8 million severely disabled people were living in Germany. […] The percentage of severely disabled people in the total population in Germany stood at 9.4%.« – Statistisches Bundesamt
When I first stumbled upon these numbers, I could not believe them. It is one more reason to learn about digital accessibility now. We are all individuals with different strengths, weaknesses, backgrounds, needs, and possibilities. I think every human being should be able to interact with the websites we are building. If you only have time for one topic this week, please check out The A11Y Project.

          <p>Hi friends! Way back in June (which already feels like such a long time ago in CSS land!) I had the pleasure of speaking about CSS layout at CSS Day conference. I’m pleased to say the video has now been published! Take a look to learn about a whole bunch of modern CSS layout techniques, with a few little tricks thrown in.

I attempted to pack a lot into this talk, but what I tried to emphasise is that many of the new CSS features we have at our disposal help (and even encourage) us to embrace the flexible web of the present day. One where we can’t possibly predict what kind of devices our user is browsing our website on, but where we can ensure our layouts are robust across all devices, by eschewing pixel-perfection in favour of something more intri…</p>

          <p># Introduction
Today, authors can use many abstractions to build their Web applications. Instead of directly interfacing with the lower-level APIs that the Web Platform provides, many authors leverage frameworks, build tools and compilers to write their applications from a higher-level perspective.
For example, components built on top of the Angular framework are authored in TypeScript with HTML templates. Underneath the hood, the Angular CLI and webpack compile everything to JavaScript and into a so-called bundle, which is then shipped to the browser.
When debugging or profiling Web applications in DevTools, you currently get to see and debug this compiled version of your code instead of the code you actually wrote. As an author, this is not want you want, though:
You don’t want to debug …</p>

          <p># An improved debugging experience
Over the past few months the Chrome DevTools team collaborated with the Angular team to launch improvements to the debugging experience in Chrome DevTools. People from both teams worked together and took steps towards enabling developers to debug and profile web applications from the authoring perspective: in terms of their source language and project structure, with access to information that is familiar and relevant to them.
This post takes a look under the hood to see which changes in Angular and Chrome DevTools were required to achieve this. Even though some of these changes are demonstrated through Angular, they can be applied to other frameworks as well. The Chrome DevTools team encourages other frameworks to adopt the new console APIs and source ma…</p>

          <p>This is a living post that will be updated as the deprecation steps outlined below
happen. 


The Web SQL Database API, which allows you to store data in a
structured manner on the user&#x27;s computer (internally based on the SQLite database engine), was
introduced in April 2009 and
abandoned in November 2010. While it
was implemented in WebKit (which powers Safari and early versions of Chrome) and remained active in
the Blink engine (that powers Chrome after the switch from WebKit), Gecko (which powers Firefox)
never implemented this feature and
WebKit removed it in 2019.
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
encourages
those needing web databases to adopt
Web Storage API technologies like
localStorage and
sessionStorage, or
IndexedDB. These
technologies show their strengths when it comes to ke…</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32648471 target="_blank">Ask HN: Is there a simple web UI toolbox for back-end devs?</a>
          <p>Slack has, for example, the Bolt frameworks (https://api.slack.com/tools/bolt) where a back-end developer can leverage the Slack UI to build whole apps. It is possible to build quite complex workflows without leaving the back-end language of the framework, using Slack Block Kit (https://api.slack.com/block-kit) like lego pieces of a simple UI.
Is there something else similar, a framework/platform where one (mainly a back-end dev) can build an app using ready UI components?

          <p>I&#x27;m trying to find a app for Ubuntu that has exactly same features as Joplin but different colors,  and different UI. Because ik it&#x27;s stupid to tell, but I&#x27;m getting negative vibes and it&#x27;s not matching my energy when I use joplin but I love the joplin because it does everything that I want.
Important features for me are:
1) Paste image (embed it so that you can see it instantly, wysiwyg)
2) Have multiple tabs support (vertical bar or horizontal bar doesn&#x27;t matter).
3) Increase font by zooming with pinch touchpad movement. Or just have better font size choices.
4) Scrolling with mouse or touchpad should be smooth. (It&#x27;s not smooth in trilium notes).
That&#x27;s all I want, and I&#x27;m quite surprised it&#x27;s so tough to find an app that does both in laptop. 
I tried zim which is probably most close to…</p>

          <p>It’s a simple question that can open doors. But it also creates tension. The person you’re seeking to connect with might not want to believe that help is possible. There’s a solace that comes from being really and truly stuck, and hope might not be on their agenda. Or there might be resistance to thinking […]</p>

Having just graduated from Dribbble’s Certified Product Design Course, Brittney joins us today to share her story and offer advice to budding product designers.
Brittney Singleton
      Visual Designer


Tell us about your background. Do you have any previous design experience?
Hi, I’m Britt, and I’m a multidisciplinary designer specializing in visual, UI/UX, and brand design. I started out as a web and graphic designer back in 2010. My career took off, eventually landing me an Art Director position at a large bank. But then, life happened. I got sick. Extremely sick, leaving me bed bound for a few years after I was diagnosed with Ly…</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/compression-streams-api/ target="_blank">Compression and decompression in the browser with the Compression Streams API</a>
          <p>The Compression Streams API
is for compressing and decompressing streams of data using the gzip or
deflate (or deflate-raw) formats.
With built in compression JavaScript applications do not need to include a compression
library, making the download size of the application smaller. Stable Chrome and Safari Technology Preview now
support this useful API. Compressing data is shown below.
const readableStream &#x3D; await fetch(&#x27;lorem.txt&#x27;).then(
  (response) &#x3D;&gt; response.body
);
const compressedReadableStream &#x3D; readableStream.pipeThrough(
  new CompressionStream(&#x27;gzip&#x27;)
);
To decompress, pipe a compressed stream through the decompression stream.
const decompressedReadableStream &#x3D; compressedReadableStream.pipeThrough(
  new DecompressionStream(&#x27;gzip&#x27;)
);
# Demo
 

# Browser support
The Compression Streams API is supported from Chromium 80 and Safari Technology Preview 152.
For other browsers, check CanIUse.

          <p>Hello HN !
I&#x27;m the founder of https://symfoz.com which is basically a RSS aggregator that allows people to partition the content they want to see in dedicated spaces called &quot;Playlists&quot;, thus reducing the time needed to find the information they need.
Why Symfoz instead of other RSS aggregators ?
- Create playlists of content, avoid mixing too many feeds in the same place. You know where everything is.
- Follow people or playlists, people can create some playlists with AWESOME content, you may benefit from it.
- We handle classic RSS feeds, but also Youtube channels, Twitter feeds, Spotify Podcasts, sub-reddits.
- An easy UI interface (This is still WIP, UI is very hard haha)
- Promote retention of information by allowing people to take notes (not highlighting but really take notes), instead of just consuming content and forget it. You&#x27;ll be able to find your notes easily.
A bit more about the project (you can skip this!), this is a side project that I&#x27;ve been working on for almost a year.
I&#x27;m a back-end developer and the stack runs in Python. If you&#x27;d like more details, please feel free to ask, I&#x27;ll be glad to answer !
Thanks for taking the time to read this, feel free to give any feedback, I would be really grateful :) !

          <p>When I first heard Nicole Sullivan talk about OOCSS, I thought “Oooh, smart.” When I read Jonathan Snook’s riff on that idea in SMACSS I thought “Oooh, smart.” When I heard Harry Roberts say “never use IDs in your CSS files” I said “Oooh, smart.”
But when BEM and roboclasses came around… I didn’t have the same reaction. I never felt attracted to these tools even though thousands of developers had success with them. I’m not sure why I never jumped in, but I’m sure verbosity and/or tooling fatigue played a part. Ultimately, I ended up settling on my own SMACSS/BEM hybrid that’s more of a .block--variant .generic {}  pattern with some global utilities mixed in.
I’m not anti-BEM nor anti-roboclasses, but as we enter a new era for CSS I think we have an opportunity to rethink best practices aro…</p>

          <p>In May 2022, the Aurora and Angular teams announced that they would collaborate on an image directive for Angular. The directive was recently released for developer preview as part of Angular v14.2. This post talks about how the new image directive, NgOptimizedImage, supports image optimization in Angular.
# Background
Images are a common and crucial component of web user experience, with 99.9% of web pages generating requests for one or more images. Images are also the most significant contributors to page weight, constituting a median of 982 kilobytes per page.
Due to their growing number and size, images can hinder the performance of web pages and affect Core Web Vitals metrics. For 79.4% of desktop pages, an image was the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) element in 2021. The pursuit of o…</p>

          <p>I really hope that the collective intelligence of Hacker News has answers, because this is the type of question that you cannot ask on stackoverflow.
The question is exactly as the title says. The following text provides context, but if you already understand what I am after, you can skip it.
----------------------------
In 1992, when we saw Visio for the first time, we  hoped that one day we would be able to use it for creating software design documents visually, and then deploying them with the press of a button. Visio is a general-purpose diagram-drawing application, so it cannot do that, but it has always supported linking and embedding, so in theory it could be used for this purpose by a specialized software design tool. However, I have never head of any such tool.

          <p>In October Chrome will take the next step in reducing the information
available in the browser&#x27;s User-Agent (UA) string, to improve privacy for users. With
this change, websites and services that rely on the User-Agent string for
certain information may need to take action. Here&#x27;s some background on what&#x27;s
happening, why Chrome is making this change, and what you can do to prepare.
# Why is User-Agent string changing
The User-Agent string includes information about the browser and the type
of device a person is using. The UA string has played an instrumental
role for websites that
want to customize user experiences as well as for anti-fraud providers who rely
on this information to identify bots and malicious attacks. Chrome is committed
to maintaining those important use cases.
Neverthele…</p>

          <p>The Console Utilities API lets you speed up your debugging workflow by providing a variety of shortcuts.


With the Console Utilities API, you can:
Stop typing long commands like document.querySelector() and, instead, use jQuery-style $ shortcuts to specify elements.
Refer to the last five DOM elements you selected on the Elements panel.
Quickly refer to elements by their XPath, which you can copy in the Element panel.
Query objects by their constructors.
List just the keys or values of objects.
Copy string representations of objects to clipboard.
Get event listeners.
Monitor events and function calls.
For a comprehensive list of all the Console Utilities API shortcuts, see the Console Utilities API reference.</p>

          <p>Hey HN, 10 years after the project began we have updated the UI for the cloud server comparison site known as EC2Instances.info. This refresh brings a sticky filter bar so you can scroll and see what filters are applied, a more compact navbar, and improved UX for comparing instances.
I&#x27;ve also fixed numerous long standing UI bugs including: comparisons now load correctly on RDS and ElastiCache, sort by max ENI works, sort by RDS instance storage works, and all dropdowns have consistent behavior.
For maintainers and contributors, all the frontend libraries are upgraded to their latest versions, https://github.com/vantage-sh/ec2instances.info. Going forward, we are aware that the homepage size is quite large and have plans to address this.
We have tried to be good stewards of this project and evolve it carefully. Eager to hear what you think of the new UI!

          <p>Hey there..
I have started writing a book on software design/architecture that provides a different perspective than existing books out there. The thesis of the book is that &quot;code is for humans&quot;. The book explains how to write code that is optimal for our primitive monkey brains. The book describes how many of the best practices in software stem from deficiencies in our cognitive abilities. It expands on best practices such as (DRY, SSOT, etc) and brings new ideas on what is good code and how to write it.
I am looking for someone to partner with on this book as it&#x27;s a huge project and I would love to be able to split the work.
I have written a rough outline and filled in about 40 pages of notes, examples and text. The project is still very much in it&#x27;s infancy.
A bit about me: I worked as the software architect of a 100+ person team at Mobileye/Intel and have many, many years of experience working on a variety of software from self driving cars to web apps.

          <p>I&#x27;m a cs student who have been selling a very specific and niche bicycle part. I have already sell quite a few locally using facebook marketplace. I recently tried Amazon and sold a few but was shocked by the 15% cut.
I&#x27;m wondering if I can/should make an online shop using vanilla html and css with PayPal/Stripe API payment buttons. I only have 3 product models and don&#x27;t need shopping carts as most people would just buy one item. Shipping fee will also be fixed. No need for SEO or analytics. I have made a few websites before and enjoy making simple lightweight ultra-fast websites, so time spent on developing the website wouldn&#x27;t be a cost to me.
Any security / legal / business aspects that I should consider?

          <p>I was just preparing a demo for an upcoming talk and it suddenly occurred to me that cascade layers would be a perfect solution to a problem I was having.
For any element of live coding, I like to meticulously prepare my demos to prevent any moments of friction on the day. I wanted to apply a bunch of default styles to a grid of cards in this container queries demo, but I wanted those styles to appear at the bottom of the stylesheet, so that when it came to live coding the demo I could write all the relevant code at the top, and the audience could just focus on the layout styles I would be discussing.

# What is FLEDGE?
FLEDGE is a proposal to serve remarketing and custom audience use cases while protecting user’s privacy. When FLEDGE executes the ad auction between buyers (DSP) and sellers (SSP), the client receives real-time signals from the FLEDGE Key/Value services. Real-time signals are critical because they provide information, such as the budget for a buyer, when a bid is calculated. They can also provide information about an ad creative to a seller, to help decide which ad is shown to the user. Without these signals, buyers and sellers are not able to conduct basic operations that the ad industry relies on.

          <p>Suppose that HN user Foo wishes to DM user Bar. HN knows their real email addresses, so Foo emails Bar@hndm.com, and HNDM auto-forwards this to Bar&#x27;s real email address. If Foo wants a response from Bar, Foo needs to tell Bar their (Foo&#x27;s) real email address, and Bar can email them directly. The only accepted/understood direct reply to one of these forwards is &quot;block&quot;, which will forever block Foo from sending to Bar. If Foo gets three blocks, they&#x27;re disallowed from sending HNDMs until the they are under three blocks, which clear at one block/week.

          <p>One aspect of web development I’ve always loathed was working with forms. Form elements have been traditionally difficult to style due to OS and browser differences, and validation can be a nightmare. Luckily the native HTML APIs added methods for improving the form validation situation. With input[type&#x3D;number] elements, you can add min and max attributes. […]

          <p>The top layer sits above its related document in the browser viewport, and each document has one associated top layer. This means that elements promoted to the top layer needn&#x27;t worry about z-index or DOM hierarchy. They also get a neat ::backdrop pseudo-element to play with. The Fullscreen API spec goes into more details as Fullscreen was a great example of the top layer in use before dialog support came along.
The top layer helps solve the problem of rendering content above the rest of the document.
The important things to remember:
Top layer is outside of the document flow.
z-index has no effect in the top layer.
Each element in the top layer has a styleable ::backdrop pseudo-element.
Each element and ::backdrop generates a new stacking context.
Elements in the top layer are stacked in …</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32540102 target="_blank">Ask HN: Suggest rigorous ways to learn design of data structures and algorithms</a>
          <p>By seriously I mean both the theory and the practical. The theory of how to actually design and analyse algorithms. And also implement them in a language. The language shouldn&#x27;t matter while thinking about algorithms.
At the moment I am not opting for something like leetcode. I want something that teach me the principles of how to actually design from the fundamentals.
Also I want to be as much language agnostic as possible. By that I mean the ability to think about algorithmic solutions to problems in terms of mental models that I can then translate to a low level language like C, or a dynamic imperative language like Python, or a functional language like Racket, SML or OCaml. Of course, the assumption here is that I must know the language I want to implement the algorithm in. So basically I want to learn about algorithms in a paradigm agnostic way so that I can implement them in any paradigm I want.
How to go about this? Do you have any book or course suggestions in mind?

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32530595 target="_blank">Find Unused CSS Across Entire Web Project [Local]?</a>
          <p>Hoping the collective wisdom of HN can help me with this one:
I&#x27;m currently archiving a site for a client which was built in WordPress [I know! I know!] by creating a static version from it. So I&#x27;ve used &#x60;curl&#x60; to download the entire site and spent a few days stripping out the tangled mess of WordPress cruft.
Next in my sites is the CSS. I&#x27;ve consolidated the eleventy billion CSS files strewn throughout WP into one central CSS file, which is about 3000 lines long. And now need to strip out all the unused selectors... of which I suspect there are many, because the site is mostly just plain text articles with occasional illustrations. No fancy-schmancy stuff at all.
Plenty of advice on the web about using Chrome Dev tools to check for unused CSS against a single page. But this is a site of 500+ pages, so I need something that will crawl the entire project and compile a list of all the CSS used/unused across the entire site.
On the face of it this seems like one of those horribly repetitive tasks which would be a nightmare for a human to do, but trivial for a computer. A solution wouldn&#x27;t even need to automagically strip the CSS out. Even just marking the used elements would allow me to see what was required or not and manually delete the rest. Pseudo-code-ually:
  for HTML file in project 
  look for class&#x3D;XXX or id&#x3D;#YYY
  look through project CSS file for .XXX or #YYY
  insert comment /*this is used in file ZZZ.html*/

          <p>My wife and I recently submitted to a mobile game jam on Newgrounds (yes, it&#x27;s still around). What started as a question of whether we could do it somehow morphed into whether we could do without so many of the seemingly needless complications rampant in our respective industries. My wife thus did all the art as traditional frame-by-frame animation (no puppets or tweening) and I preceded without a game engine. I did use a pre-processor that gives JS a Lisp syntax (Parenscript), because C-syntax is gross. We hope the end result, while definitely of small scope, will serve to inspire some thought as to what is and isn&#x27;t needed in your next project.

          <p>While running a UI/UX design team for B2B startups, I do enjoy coaching developers from time to time. Helping them become better at recognizing why something feels ugly or off and how to find solutions quickly.
I wonder if people would be interested in a weekly UI/UX design challenge over email. And where I pick one or two submitted designs to provide deeper analysis and tips on how to make it better and why.

          <p>Last month, at Lazy Load, Paul Calvano gave a presentation where he dove deep into HTTP Archive to uncover some common performance mistakes. One of the issues he explored were sites that preloaded resources that never actually end up being used by the page.
The preload hint is a way of indicating to the browser that a particular resource will be needed for that page, and that the browser should request it now, when the preload hint is encountered, rather than waiting for later discovery. When used selectively and sparingly it can be a great way to help resources that the browser won’t discover in the HTML itself—a background image referenced in CSS, a JavaScript file injected by a script loader, etc—arrive much earlier.
Unfortunately, like anything, it can also be misused and the consequen…</p>

Every brilliant design starts with an amazing idea, as well as hundreds of not-so-amazing ones. To the user’s eye, these rejected concepts aren’t at all visible, however, their experience would be nowhere near as delightful if mistakes, iterations, and learnings didn’t happen during the design process.
In the Double Diamond, a familiar framework and close friend to the design community, the third stage is where the brainstorming and ideating really kick off.

          <p>Following on from the previous announcement, support of HTTP/2 Server Push will be disabled by default in Chrome 106 and other Chromium-based browsers in their next releases.
# Why is this being removed?
HTTP/2 Server Push allowed websites to proactively send resources needed by the page instead of waiting for them to be requested. However, it was problematic as Jake Archibald wrote about previously, and the performance benefits were often difficult to realize. As a result, it was not used much with only 1.25% of HTTP/2 sites making use of this feature.
Analysis of the use of HTTP/2 Server Push has mixed results (Chrome, Akamai), without a clear net performance gain and in many cases performance regressions.
Push was not implemented in many HTTP/3 servers and clients—even though it was inc…</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/devtools-tips-7/ target="_blank">DevTools Tips: How to inspect CSS grid</a>
          <p>Chrome DevTools makes debugging CSS grid layouts intuitive with a variety of visualization options.


Watch the video to learn how to toggle the grid overlay in the Elements panel and use it to:
Visualize and inspect grid layouts.
See row and column numbers to refer to when placing grid items.
Use line and area names and see them on the overlay if you have a lot of grid items and the numbers are confusing.
Check track sizes.
Additionally, with the Grid Editor in the Elements &gt; Styles pane, you can align items and their content in a grid layout with a click of a button instead of typing CSS rules.
For a more hands-on learning experience, follow the Inspect CSS Grid tutorial.</p>

          <p>Third-party resources (such as embeds and scripts) are heavily used across the web today. They provide out-of-the-box solutions for embedding social media, videos, analytics, live chat, advertising, A/B testing, personalization, and others. Third-party embeds are a necessary part of modern websites that allow site owners to focus on their core competencies, while offloading standard but critical functions to external providers.
When both first party and third parties on a web page work in harmony, it is possible for a page to deliver a great user-experience. However, this requires significant effort from both engineering and business teams and is often overlooked, resulting in less than performant web pages and a negative impact to user-centric metrics such as the Core Web Vitals.

          <p>In my team, I suggest that before starting coding/implementing any middle-size/big feature (e.g., an HTTP endpoint that, supposedly, needs a new db table) the engineers involved (which usually involves all the backend engineers) should have a &quot;design&quot; session where:
- potential high-level solutions are discussed
- potential implementations are discussed (not low-level details, but at least the important/risky ones)
- and once a &quot;final&quot; decision is made, whoever is in charge of pushing the feature live to production can start with the implementation. The rest of the team can review the implmentation later on knowing that it should follow the final decision the team agreed on
The team doesn&#x27;t like the approach that much because:

          <p>Hello HN!
I have been a hobbyist programmer for the last 3 years or so, and along the way, I have always wanted to be a game developer/designer.
While I got some small success for myself, most of my games are terrible and not really fun, in terms of concept and gameplay. I don&#x27;t consider myself a person that good at writing stories (or anything other than programming) and often find my games bland and boring pretty fast.
So, what I&#x27;m asking now is some advice. Any game devs here who has gained some success (whether veteran or not), what is your advice for starting game dev? What are your resources and books for learning about game dev and game design?

          <p>I’ve been using GitHub Copilot full time over the summer and have collected my thoughts on this new industry redefining tool. It’s a product that has the potential to impact my life greatly and a product that’s a mix of helpful, clumsy, and potentially dangerous. Let’s dive into some of the good and bad parts of Copilot.
The $10 price point is perfect because it makes me mad
The pricing model for Copilot is my favorite part. $10/month doubles my GitHub costs. That’s almost one Netflix… to have tab completion!? $10/month for copy-pasta from StackOverflow? No way, José.

Tell us about your background. Why did you decide to learn product design?
I’ve worked as a graphic designer for four years, primarily at my current company and on freelance projects.
Why learn product design? Funny story. Two years ago, I made a bet with my girlfriend that I was going to learn programming and get a job offer in one year. Keep in mind, I had never seen a line of code in my life and with my background in marketing, math and logic weren’t my stronges…</p>

          <p>I&#x27;m at the point where I am starting to write shaders to do custom effects in WebGL,  such as combining a left and a right image to make an anaglyph image.
What I&#x27;m thinking about next is about how to make &quot;game like&quot; UIs on the web for desktop and mobile.  Some things that I am inspired by are:
(1) The Playstation 3 interface https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XrossMediaBar
(2) Interfaces in video games for viewing a database or documentation about the game world.  I&#x27;d like to make something similar but for some part of the real world.
The Pokédex from Pokémon is a familiar example but it&#x27;s not such a good one because Pokémon games mostly run on low-spec handhelds,  so I am thinking more about what you&#x27;d see on a PC or TV console games...  But instead of using a game controller you&#x27;d be using the touchscreen,  mouse or keyboard.
(3) However I very much like how games for the Nintendo DS/3DS use the touchscreen such as peeling stickers in Paper Mario Sticker Star and how you can make Luigi fight in the boss battles in Mario and Luigi Dream Team.  So some advanced capability for touch gestures is wanted.
I&#x27;d prefer programming in Javascript,  could accept Typescript but it would be a hard sell if it (say) compiled something else to WebAssembly unless that came with awesome capabilities.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32440171 target="_blank">Show HN: Agency quality design and development for a very un-agency like price</a>
          <p>Howdy HN! Been working on a side project of mine for about a year called Gloutir. It&#x27;s essentially an &#x27;agency of one&#x27; design and development service using a subscription or retainer model for billing (Stripe + Memberstack).
I primarily focus on WordPress and Webflow design and development as I realized long ago that there&#x27;s a huge demand for these services  in the design / marketing agency space.
I&#x27;ve had a lot of success the past year with this work, and surprisingly (or unsurprisingly) every single client of mine has been a larger agency needing additional help. That kind of makes sense because an agency can immediately see the value in what I offer without really having to be convinced.
Recently I&#x27;ve introduced a weekly option for clients looking to launch fast and spend less ($1,000 a week, maybe not sustainable but we’ll see). I&#x27;d love to get more involved with startups needing landing page work / design services.
There are a number of people doing stuff like this, but I do want to clarify that this is never going to be an &quot;unlimited design&quot; style subscription service. I&#x27;ve intentionally set a hard cap on the number of clients because it&#x27;s simply impossible to accommodate more than a certain number of clients while keeping the quality of work where it needs to be.
Anywho, curious what you all think and if you have any suggestions on how to improve.

          <p>The Chrome DevTools Animations tab is a powerful tool that helps you slow down, replay, adjust CSS animation timings, and see the results right away.


The Animations tab, while open, records animations automatically, conveniently groups them, and lets you:
Replay and slow down animations to better inspect them.
Adjust durations, timings, and delays by dragging points in a timeline instead of guessing and setting CSS values manually.
Additionally, you can edit the easing timings and set custom cubic-bezier curve values with the Easing Editor in the Elements &gt; Styles pane. To learn more, see Edit animation and transition timings with the Easing Editor.
For a more hands-on learning experience, follow the Inspect and modify CSS animation effects guide.</p>

I have nothing against service providers and think the people providing these services can be invaluable, but am more curious to hear from people people who tried the sprint for their own firm.

I call it the &quot;publish directory&quot; but perhaps there&#x27;s a more popular term of art? ISPs tend to call it the www directory, or public_html, or htdocs, but I&#x27;m not convinced any of them is particularly well known to less technical peeps.

          <p>For those of you not familiar with the world of web extension development, a storm is brewing with Chrome. Google will stop support for manifest version 2, which is what the vast majority of web extensions use. Manifest version 3 sees many changes but the largest change is moving from persistent background scripts to service […]

          <p>Recently I was reading about fluid simulation and stumbled upon the Gauss Seidel method. I got interested in how it works and made a program that visualizes the method in action.
I had the idea of making an interactive book-like thing for a while, so took this as a chance to do just that.
Note that touch input doesn&#x27;t work and the layout is targeted towards bigger screens, so it doesn&#x27;t function properly on mobile.
It was fun to make and I wanted to share it. Maybe someone will find it useful. Corrections and feedback are welcome.
Technical Stuff
- A single 1.7MB HTML file with embedded JavaScript and WebAssembly. You can save this single file and double click it to run.
- A math typesetter from scratch in C that compiles/renders the equations in real-time (uses KaTex fonts and STB true type to rasterize the fonts).
- Platform code is done using Sokol (tested on windows and web).
- The UI is done using Dear ImGui (Most of the code is done in C++ to use ImGui without a wrapper except for the equations compiler).

          <a href=https://genieframework.com/blog/announcing-genie-builder.html target="_blank">Show HN: Genie Builder, no-code UI plugin for building data apps</a>
          <p>Hi! Genie Builder is a free VSCode plugin that makes it easy to build web GUIs for Julia applications (and in future, Python apps too). Users can simply drag &amp; drop UI elements to create interactive dashboards and data apps, without writing any frontend code.
The tool is designed for data scientists and researchers who need to expose their data models to business users with an interactive web application, but lack the software development skills to build one.
Genie Builder completely eliminates the need to learn frontend development to code the UI. And very soon, we’re also going to support one-click cloud deployments to make it easy to build AND deploy data apps - no frontend nor devops skills required.
I’m Adrian, the creator of the open-source Genie web framework (https://genieframework.com/). Genie offers low-code libraries for building data applications - just like Streamlit or Dash, but for JuliaLang. We developed Genie Builder because of feedback from our open source community who needs more productive data tooling.
