          <p>The cool thing is always a little out of reach. And for most of us, once we get it, it‚Äôs not seen as cool any more. This is not an accident. One definition of cool are things that are just out of reach.</p>

          <p>Hey all -
Invoke started as one of the earliest Stable Diffusion UIs (you may remember it as ‚Äúlstein‚Äù), and has evolved significantly into a full fledged react/typescript web app.
We‚Äôve been hard at work building a professional-grade backend to support our commercial move to serving businesses and enterprise with a hosted offering (invoke.ai), while keeping Invoke one of the best ways to self-host and create content as an open-core project.
As of 3.0, all of the developments we‚Äôve been working on and tweaking for our hosted environment are available to install and use locally, including an API and graph-based execution architecture - And, to demonstrate our commitment to free and open-source software, we‚Äôve updated our license to the most explicitly permissive license available - Apache 2.‚Ä¶</p>

          <a href=https://daverupert.com/2023/07/my-dad-recliner/ target="_blank">My dad recliner</a>
          <p>After five+ years of negotiation with my wife, I got the gift of a wonderful dad-ass recliner for my 43rd birthday. It‚Äôs petite and looks like a regular leather dad chair before it‚Äôs glorious transformation into a relaxation station. Per tradition, kids aren‚Äôt allowed to use dad‚Äôs recliner; it‚Äôs the one sacred space in our house.
The recliner has been a major boost to my calmness. Having my feet up after a long day of sitting at my desk produces a psychological effect that scientists refer to as ‚Äúmaxin‚Äô and relaxin‚Äô‚Äù. This is not a sports-dad chair for yelling at my fantasy employees, oh no. This, my lovelies, is a book nook for a grown man. A stack of devices (iPad, Kindle, Macbook) sits piled next to the chair so I can follow whatever whim the Muses enchant me with, as the forefathers intended. President Ben Franklin once wrote in his diary ‚ÄúThe secret to Man‚Äôs creativity is having a sweet ass recumbent chair.‚Äù
This recliner will launch a thousand blog posts. This recliner is where I‚Äôll write the next great American sci-fi novel. This recliner is where I‚Äôll create apps and games late at night after the family goes to sleep. This recliner is where I‚Äôll nod off on lazy Saturday afternoons like a dog in the sun. This recliner is where I‚Äôll store decades and decades of farts until I die and my children‚Äôs children judiciously and uncaringly throw it in a dumpster, divorced of sentimentality and awareness of the suitcases of emotional baggage from grandpa‚Äôs ancient computer job that I unpacked in this chair.</p>

          <a href=https://daverupert.com/2023/07/liquid-death/ target="_blank">Liquid Death</a>
          <p>I have a brief window of opportunity where my brain is allowing me to change my default drink of choice. It could be my taste buds evolving, some secret recipe update, or the news that the WHO is saying aspartame as ‚Äúpossibly carcinogenic‚Äù‚Ä¶ but for whatever reason Diet Coke doesn‚Äôt taste as good to me as it used to, so I‚Äôm making changes. There‚Äôs a new beverage in my fridge: Liquid Death.
Liquid Death? Isn‚Äôt that just water in a can? Yes, but specifically I‚Äôm enjoying the ‚ÄúGrim Leafer‚Äù, their agave iced tea. It‚Äôs a light flavor ‚Äì agave-sweet, but not too sweet ‚Äì an enjoyable step up from drinking boring ol‚Äô water from a can. Although, the water in the ice cold can is delicious, cool, and refreshing. I‚Äôve tried other drinks, but Liquid Death has been the one candidate with enough potential for a successful wholesale switch.
Liquid Death is an interesting product to me. It‚Äôs entire brand is: water, but hardcore. As if Monster energy drinks started doing yoga and got passionate about staying hydrated. A weird blend of dad jokes and toxic masculinity applied to water. Why does water have to have skulls? Why not fill up a water bottle?
I guess my answer for that is‚Ä¶ I have water bottles. Thousands. I can do that but let‚Äôs be honest, sipping on water bottles is boring. A water bottle or double walled tumbler can‚Äôt match the tactile thrill of snapping into a cold one‚Ä¶ mmm‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the user experience I crave. Me, a god, breaking open metal canisters with my bare hands. It‚Äôs not that sensational, but there‚Äôs a dopamine hit and selfish reward center activated in my brain.
One day I‚Äôll ditch the cans and move over to plain ol‚Äô sun tea or kombucha I brew in a window or closet (respectively). One habit substitution at a time though, starting with eliminating the ‚Äúpossibly carcinogenic‚Äù one.</p>

I built a podcast app before this, which 100,000 people use every month, https://podyssey.fm. No one tech company owns podcasts it is a medium that works through RSS feeds.
See this image for a visual on how podcasts work [https://ax0.taddy.org/blog/investment-pitch/podcast-ecosyste...]
See this image for a visual on how bam! works [https://ax0.taddy.org/blog/investment-pitch/taddy-ecosystem....] (its the same!)
If you are a webtoons creator and want to be on the bam! app, you can self-publish your Webtoon, you just have to output a file that conforms to this standard: https://3s-docs.org/comicseries (follow the instructions on how to notify us of your webtoons feed)
If you aren&#x27;t a developer and a webtoons creators, I also build taddy.org (where all you have to do is drag + drop your artwork and creates the feed for you)
Let me know what you think!

          <p>In Chrome 116, Chrome is shipping the following three new Federated Credential
Management (FedCM)
features:
Login Hint API: Specify a preferred user account to be
signed in.
User Info API: Fetch the information of the returning user
so that the identity provider (IdP) can render a personalized sign-in button
within an iframe.
RP Context API: Use a title different from &#x27;Sign in&#x27;  in
the FedCM dialog.
Additionally, Chrome is starting an origin
trial for the IdP Sign-In Status
API. The IdP Sign-in Status API is a requirement and will be a
breaking change when it&#x27;s shipped. If you have an existing implementation of
FedCM, make sure to participate in the origin trial.

          <p>We often romanticize the notion of programming, presenting it as an abstract form of art, a science, or even a form of magic. The truth, however, is much more practical and grounded. Code, in its essence, is communication. At the start of my book, Learning JavaScript Design Patterns, I say &quot;good code is like a love letter to the next developer who will maintain it&quot;. It is an intimate correspondence, from one developer to another, spanning time and space.</p>

          <p>For web developers, WebGPU is a web graphics API that provides a unified and fast access to GPUs by exposing modern hardware capabilities and allowing rendering and computation operations on a GPU, similar to Direct3D 12, Metal, and Vulkan.
While it‚Äôs true, that story is not complete. WebGPU is first and foremost the result of a collaborative effort including major companies such as Apple, Google, Intel, Mozilla, and Microsoft. Among them, some realized that WebGPU could be more than a Javascript API but a cross-platform graphics API that could be used by developers across ecosystems other than the web. To fulfill the primary goal, a JavaScript API was introduced in Chrome 113. However, another significant project has been developed alongside it: the webgpu.h C API. This C header file list‚Ä¶</p>

# Programmatically open a Sidepanel
Sidepanel has been one of the most requested features in Chrome extensions and has been available in Chrome since version 114. After launching the Side Panel API, one of the first pieces of feedback that we‚Äôve received was that developers want a way to programmatically open a side panel. And here it is: chrome.sidePanel.open is now in beta. You can use it to open the extension side panel programmatically in response to a user interaction, such as a context menu click:
chrome.contextMenus.onClicked.addListener((info, tab) &#x3D;&gt; {
  if (info.menuItemId &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;openSidePanel&#x27;) {
    // This will open the panel in all the pages on the current window.
    chrome.sidePanel.open({ windowId: tab.windowId });
  }
});

          <p>Hey HackerNews!
I&#x27;m Renat Abyasov, CEO of Wonderslide, and today I&#x27;m thrilled to share our creation with you.
Wonderslide is an AI-powered presentation design tool that saves you time and effort. Simply input your draft, and in seconds, it generates stunning, fully editable PowerPoint slides.
A few years ago, instead of reading a book to my daughter, I found myself creating slides for meetings and conferences. &quot;There must be a way to automate this routine,&quot; I thought. Then, I met a group of like-minded people who envisioned robots creating presentations instead of humans.
We had little more than a dream when we were just starting ‚Äî a dream to stop wasting precious time on presentations. And now, after many countless iterations, we&#x27;re finally ready to reveal our AI designer to the world.
Key Features:
 ‚Ä¢ Automated slide layout and redesign with one click
 ‚Ä¢ ML-based image and icon matching
 ‚Ä¢ AI-powered text editing
 ‚Ä¢ Native export to .pptx
The AI designer seamlessly applies your content to the layout, incorporating color schemes, images, and icons, all optimized with the golden ratio in mind.
Under the hood, our neural networks analyze and structure different types of content, while the ChatGPT API helps highlight key points and condense text. The result is a range of slide versions for you to choose from.
Try Wonderslide now and let us know your thoughts! Has it made creating presentations more efficient? Did it enhance the visual appeal? Is the user interface intuitive? Your feedback is invaluable as we strive to improve our service.

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/debugging-chrome-on-ios/ target="_blank">Debugging websites in Chrome on iOS 16.4+</a>
          <p>From Chrome 115 you can enable Safari Web Inspector debugging for Chrome on iOS. This post explains how to get started.
Prior to Chrome 115, debugging webpages required building Chrome for iOS from source, as the release version of WKWebView did not support remote Web Inspector debugging. In Chrome 73, we added the chrome://inspect page which locally displays JavaScript logs to assist in debugging webpages. Now that WKWebView allows Web Inspector debugging in release (as of iOS 16.4), we have added a setting in Chrome 115 to enable this feature and further improve the developer experience.
# Getting started
On your iOS device you need:
iOS 16.4 or greater.
Chrome 115 or greater.
On your Mac you need:
The Safari Develop menu enabled. Enable this from Safari application settings, Advanced Settings tab.
On your iOS device launch the Chrome app and navigate to Settings. In Content Settings, enable Web Inspector. Relaunch Chrome for iOS after changing this setting.
# Debugging your site
With the setting enabled, you can debug any page running in Chrome for iOS by following these steps.
Connect your iOS device to a Mac with a cable.
In Chrome for iOS, navigate to the website which you&#x27;d like to inspect.
On your Mac, launch Safari. From the Develop menu, hover over the name of your connected device and select the url of the website which you would like to inspect.
The displayed Web Inspector window will allow debugging of the current web view. For more details about using Safari Developer Tools, refer to Apple&#x27;s documentation.</p>

          <p>Following on from my hard and easy way of getting timezone from an IP address, having the timezone (as text) is one thing, now finding the actual offset is entirely a different problem.

TL:DR; jump to the spoiler if you can&#x27;t be bothered to read/listen to me ramble!
The problem isn&#x27;t timezones, it&#x27;s day light saving
It&#x27;s all very well knowing what timezone a particularly location is sitting on. We can show the user the UTC time, but when it doesn&#x27;t match the wall clock because they&#x27;re currently observing DST, then it&#x27;s just‚Ä¶weird.
So now we need to know if the location is observing DST, or not. Or if perhaps they never observe DST (like Hawaii).
The long hard way
There is the IANA timezone dataset which has custom data structures that describe the location and how time is observed in that‚Ä¶</p>

          <p>Hey,
David Cain has a lot of very good thoughts out there on his blog. When I read the current article ¬ªdon‚Äôt forget to swim now and then¬´, I wholeheartedly agreed to many aspects in it. We people strive for activities our bodies and brains adapted to over eons, while we struggle a lot with modern and/or activities we are not a adapted to: Politics (too abstract, unpredictable), telecommunication (unreal, missing sensoric information), and others. What I think is interesting about it is that it explains why we relax when going for a swim or run, hiking, sitting in nature around a fireplace, go camping (despite it is uncomfortable compare to our home). And it‚Äôs why we are stressed when being in meetings, watching TV, news all day. Leo Babauta has some helpful ideas on how to let go of sacre‚Ä¶</p>

          <p>Parsing of URLs on the client side has been a common practice for two decades. The early days included using illegible regular expressions but the JavaScript specification eventually evolved into a new URL method of parsing URLs. While URL is incredibly useful when a valid URL is provided, an invalid string will throw an error [‚Ä¶]

          <p>I just bought a house that has a really weird layout. Previous owner had it split for a rental unit and I&#x27;m taking over the whole house. It needs a lot of work and I&#x27;m pretty handy when it comes to the work but not when it comes to know how to layout rooms / spaces and even less when it comes to design. I&#x27;m already looking for a professional interior designer but I&#x27;d also like to play with some layouts myself as well.

          <p>Here&#x27;s what you need to know:
Use ScrollTimeline and ViewTimeline to create scroll-driven animations that enhance user experience.
Fenced frames work along other Privacy Sandbox APIs to embed relevant content while preventing unnecessary context sharing.
With the Topics API the browser can share information with third parties about a user&#x27;s interests while preserving privacy.
And there‚Äôs plenty more.
I‚Äôm Adriana Jara. Let‚Äôs dive in and see what‚Äôs new for developers in Chrome 115.
# Scroll driven animations
Scroll-driven animations are a common UX pattern on the web. A scroll-driven animation is linked to the scroll position of a scroll container.
This means that as you scroll up or down, the linked animation goes forward or backward in direct response.
The following examples demonstrate so‚Ä¶</p>

          <p>So far, 2023 has been a busy year in the world of Chrome extensions. Your valuable feedback has allowed us to improve the extension platform and our documentation. We also continue collaborating with other browser vendors in the WebExtensions Community Group so that extension APIs work more consistently across browsers.
In this post, we‚Äôll share with you a few changes that the Chrome extension team has worked on during the first half of this year and what upcoming features will be released later this quarter. Let&#x27;s get started!
If you‚Äôd like a TL;DR, feel free to jump to the Coming soon... section for new extension features you can start looking forward to üôÇ.

          <p>I wonder if I am the only one! I tried Fitness+ a few times (the meditation part for now, really), and it&#x27;s almost impossible to navigate. They focus on teachers, nothing is grouped or wrongly grouped.
The health app as well. It&#x27;s just a randomly generated dashboard and super hard to navigate. I can see that they mimiced the Health app design for Fitness+ to some degree.
Like is this a new trend, or is nobody from Apple themselves actually using these apps?

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;36691782 target="_blank">Ask HN: Thunderbird for RSS?</a>
          <p>Am I the only one using Thunderbird strictly as an RSS client? I&#x27;ve seen countless RSS clients recommended here over the years but none ever have the features to make me switch, mainly due to lacking extension support (for things like uBlock Origin and Bypass Paywalls) or privacy concerns from not running on a local Linux desktop. (I haven&#x27;t heavily used the e-mail functionality in Thunderbird in over two decades. I haven&#x27;t tried the Chat or any other functionality at all.)
Is there something I&#x27;m missing out on? Is there a client with all the same features and then some that I just haven&#x27;t found yet? I&#x27;ve looked at Feedly, Inoreader, and many others through the years but none have risen to the level of replacement. It&#x27;s not broken so I&#x27;m not looking to fix it but I&#x27;m open to hearing how others manage their feeds to see if there&#x27;s any possible improvements I&#x27;ve overlooked.
Full disclosure: I&#x27;ve donated in the past to Thunderbird/Mozilla, including company matches.

          <p># What‚Äôs new with scroll-driven animations?
Scroll-driven animations are a way to add interactivity and visual interest to your website or web application, triggered by the user&#x27;s scroll position. This can be a great way to keep users engaged and make your website more visually appealing.
          
In the past, the only way to create scroll-driven animations was to respond to the scroll event on the main thread. This caused two major problems:
Scrolling is performed on a separate process and therefore delivers scroll events asynchronously.
Main thread animations are subject to jank.
This makes creating performant scroll-driven animations that are in-sync with scrolling impossible or very difficult.
We are now introducing a new set of APIs to support scroll-driven animations, which you can‚Ä¶</p>

          <p>The Recorder panel lets you record, replay, share, and measure user flows on your website. Watch the video to see it in action.
  
  

For a more hands-on experience, see the Record, replay, and measure user flows tutorial.
The DevTools team is actively developing the Recorder panel and has added the following new capabilities since the video came out. Now you can:
Export and share your recordings in various formats, including custom ones.
Slow down the replay and debug during the recording:

Inspect the code of the recording.
Set breakpoints and execute step by step.
Edit steps both during the recording and after.
Install extensions to expand the Recorder capabilities.
Customize the Recorder by building an extension yourself.

          <p>I&#x27;ve been branching out from my usual Game Boy folly and have been tinkering with the Wonder Swan (an interesting little Japanese exclusive handheld). The original Wonder Swan can do eight shades of grey and has no backlight (very much like the original Game Boys for viewing).
Given my experience with Game Boys and recent (basic) electronics, I thought I&#x27;d try my hand at a backlight mod (where LEDs are used light up behind the display). I&#x27;m pretty happy with the final result and this is how I did it.

Build steps
For the backlight, I used a faulty DS Lite display - both bottom or top screen will work as we&#x27;re only interested in the LED and filters.

From the DS Lite display, remove the metal shielding from the back, remove the front polarizer (I&#x27;m guessing) and then separate the back (whit‚Ä¶</p>

I am looking for a single productivity tool that can do everything I want without having to use gdocs, Microsoft etc.
Can anyone refer such a tool?

          <p>Hi HN, I am in the market for a new monitor and would like to ask you guys for some recommendations.
My requirements are:
- Good for frontend work. High DPI, high resolution. Not excessively blurry, or retina-like. Good color representation.
- Single monitor setup.
- Be able to see 3 screens side by side comfortably, with my coding screen at minimum 16px font size
- Around 1-1.5k.
- Can be driven by a Macbook Pro
I am currently comparing a Dell 43&quot; 4K Ultrasharp screen (dell u4323qe)  vs a LG 40&quot; Ultrawide 5kx2k (lg 40wp95c-w). I don&#x27;t have any experience using an ultrawide vs a very large screen so feedback around that decision (or recommendations of other monitors) would be very useful.

          <p>Back in May I had the privilege of speaking at Beyond Tellerand, an incredible conference in D√ºsseldorf, Germany, with content extending way beyond web design into the realms of animation, mural painting, typography, digital art, Japanese calligraphy and more!
My own talk was on CSS layout, including some of the exciting new features we have at our disposal. If you want to get up to speed on what‚Äôs new in CSS layout, this is a good place to start.

Here‚Äôs a wrap up from the conference too. Enjoy!</p>

          <p>Since 2016 I‚Äôve used, created and contributed to multiple design systems.
I‚Äôve seen what works and what doesn‚Äôt. By ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt‚Äù I mean designers don‚Äôt trust it. And as a result they don‚Äôt use it.
When I‚Äôm feeling sassy, I call these people ‚Äòcowboy designers‚Äô.
Now there are some designers that will ignore your design system no matter how good it is.
These people are true cowboys and they wear the hats ü§†. But most designers would prefer to use tried and tested patterns. As long as they can trust them.
And I‚Äôve found that there are 5 key elements a design system needs to have in order to make it so good that designers choose it over doing their own thing.
Here they are:
Key element #1: research findings and rationale
Designers need to know they can trust a pattern.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;36629522 target="_blank">Ask HN: How do you do version control during hardware-software co-design?</a>
          <p>How do folks develop PCBs, firmware, host-software, maybe even ASICs and track versions of each? Can these various components be effectively tracked in a single repository? Specifically:
The timelines for design cycles vary greatly ‚Äì it can range from mere minutes for host software changes, builds, and tests, to hours for FPGA synthesis, and days to weeks for PCBs. ASIC development can span months to years.
Artifacts: in software we have mostly text (we can diff), we can build quickly or cache builds or run incremental builds; none of that works in the physical world. Is it advisable to check in a mechanical or electrical engineering design project into a git repository?
What do folks do, what is your experience, what works, what does not?

          <p>I&#x27;ve realized over time that one thing I prefer about a Twitter-like chronological feed compared to any RSS app I&#x27;ve ever used is that I don&#x27;t feel like I have to catch up or get to &quot;inbox zero&quot; or whatever; when the app loads, the most recent stuff is up top, and older stuff falls away without me having to do anything (i.e. &quot;mark as read&quot;).
Is there an RSS reader that provides this experience?

          <p>Hi,
I am working on a MVP iOS and Android app and would like to get early version out in about 10 days from now. This is to get it hands of potential users in 3 weeks from now.
I haven‚Äôt built UI stuff before so I am bit concerned of initial UX and how it will impact my early adopters..
Any suggestions / resources to follow some basic guidelines so that it‚Äôs not too shabby UX wise would be greatly helpful

          <p>‚ÄúElectronic products these days are based on chips with hundreds of connectors. Connecting them can involve hundreds of wires. A PC board is an inexpensive way to connect all the wires at once. When Steve Jobs and I started, with a blue box and then the Apple I and Apple II computers, I did the digital design, connecting hundreds of wires myself on the prototypes. Steve Jobs took the role of getting PC boards made so that we could manufacture sellable products.
After a short while we had outside companies create the PC boards according to my designs. I was extremely proud of one design that far exceeded what had been done before. That was a floppy disk interface card so you could attach a disk and type ‚ÄúRun Checkbook‚Äù to run the Checkbook program, rather than finding a cassette tape labele‚Ä¶</p>

          <p>With Twitter on it&#x27;s MySpace trajectory, I have started to see more and more Mastodon posts (whose ideology I support with much fan fare) but honestly I think that it won&#x27;t see much adoption outside of niche groups and techies just because of it&#x27;s ugly UI. The Achilles heel of open source projects...
Sample size is low, but everyone whom I ask outside of my tech circle says that they prefer Twitter&#x27;s UI because Mastodon looks kinda clunky or just ugly. And seems like some Mastodon users also agree[1]. As such, I wanted to see what the sentiment on HN is, that is, do you like Mastodon&#x27;s UI?

          <p>When it comes to finding relationships between elements, we traditionally think of a top-down approach. We can thank CSS and querySelector/querySelectorAll for that relationship in selectors. What if we want to find an element‚Äôs parent based on selector? To look up the element tree and find a parent by selector, you can use HTMLElement‚Äòs closest [‚Ä¶]

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;36593583 target="_blank">Ask HN: How do you display HTML tables on any screen size?</a>
          <p>For the longest time I hated how I could not easily make HTML tables that are showing nice excel like data (i.e. they are really correctly using table, tr, and td tags for data not layout) to look good on mobile.
I finally have a solution I love. I keep using it over and over.
headers :&#x3D; []string{&quot;name&quot;, &quot;age&quot;, &quot;species&quot;, &quot;home_planet&quot;, &quot;language&quot;, &quot;occupation&quot;}
I define the headers and call:
c.MakeCells(list, headers, &quot;_welcome&quot;)
The list is an array of key values pairs, and _welcome is just the name of the view.
{{ define &quot;_welcome_col1&quot; }}
{{ $row :&#x3D; index . &quot;row&quot; }}
{{ index $row &quot;name&quot; }}
{{ end }}
{{ define &quot;_welcome_col2&quot; }}
{{ $row :&#x3D; index . &quot;row&quot; }}
{{ index $row &quot;age&quot; }}
{{ end }}
etc.
Then with tailwindcss I have:

    {{ template &quot;_table_large&quot; . }}


    {{ template &quot;_table_small&quot; . }}

So I&#x27;m rendering both the tables on the page but only 1 will show depending on the size of the screen.
And the logic in _table_small is the secret to the whole thing. Instead of displaying each row horizontally, it repeats the headers vertically as col1 and then col2 is each row value.
You can see demo at https://many.pw/
Just make the window smaller if you are on desktop and it will jump to the small version.

          <p>Hey,
it‚Äôs been a while again since my last edition. Spring and summer here are always a busy season for me, splitting my available time into two jobs: Web work (or currently project management) and my garden. I‚Äôll try to catch up more regularly now again, so maybe another edition will follow soon.
I‚Äôm learning to value my market garden nursery more and more. It forces me to be in a passive, listening and watching mode, and only interfere if I have a proper plan to make an impact. When you do things improperly, you may end up having twice the work. Or even worse, your plants suffer and you get less crop.
With software development it‚Äôs often very similar. We can push forwards and run behind latest trends and technologies but without a proper plan, you end up having these endless projects. Be‚Ä¶</p>

          <p>After my wrangle with getting a timezone from an IP address by reducing large databases down from several hundred megabytes down to only a few, then discovering IPv6 didn&#x27;t work (so I then applied my same logic to get 700MB to 10MB), the ever lovely Phil Hawksworth pointed out that (of course) Netlify has this data available in their edge functions.
I totally overlooked the feature (maybe I didn&#x27;t even look!). So let&#x27;s implement that and then discover the glaring bug in all of the code so far.

Netlify edge function&#x27;s geo prop
Phil kindly sent me a direct message on Space Karen&#x27;s website pointing me to the geo property provided in edge function calls.
This (of course ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) means the code for the function is (for me) stupid simple:

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;36559258 target="_blank">Ask HN: Could an oxygen concentrator increase my productivity?</a>
          <p>Has anyone here tried using an oxygen concentrator to increase their productivity?  I can get the CO2 level in my room to around 580 with a comfortable temperature, but I never feel quite as clear-headed as when I&#x27;m working outside.  I&#x27;m wondering if getting an oxygen concentrator that gets my effective CO2 level to ~400 would carry any risks or downsides that I should know about. For example, one thing I&#x27;m learning is that these machines can be loud, so I&#x27;d need to consider whether the productivity gain from increased oxygen would be offset by increased ambient noise.
Update: Here are a list of things I think I&#x27;ll try based on comments: 1. oxygen cylinder, 2. CO2 scrubber, 3. oxygen concentrator, 4. air exchanger.

          <p>Picture this.
You‚Äôre designing a form but the questions are complicated. Users need a lot of guidance to understand each question. But this makes the page long and messy.
You run through various patterns.
‚ÄòTooltips!‚Äô, you say to yourself.
And that‚Äôs cool because tooltips keep things clean while allowing users to access extra information. You polish the designs, get them ready for dev and you go to bed happy.
At least until you do some usability testing.
Now picture this.

Seems like on mobile browser it doesnt keep to the viewport anymore so you have to horizontally scroll. I see it both on mobile Firefox and chrome. Increasing font size in the accessibility settings makes no difference either.

The standard API is more feature rich and has well-defined metrics publicly documented in the W3C specification Identifiers for WebRTC&#x27;s Statistics API. The specification includes descriptions of each metric listed in this guide and many more.

I&#x27;m sharing a project I&#x27;ve been working on: a browser-based code editor with a chat UI and autocompletion feature similar to GitHub Copilot. It&#x27;s entirely open-source and MIT licensed.
Feel free to give it a try at https://www.lmed.io/ and view the code repository at https://github.com/jongomez/lmed
Looking forward to your thoughts and feedback.

          <p>This week I decided it was time to try to revive some of the casualties from my recent Vercel incident, and though webmentions.app is the more useful, I though I&#x27;d start with the, so I thought, low hanging fruit - &quot;how many days to Christmas&quot;.
It turned into 3 days of complicated problem solving and working against systems that just didn&#x27;t want to work the way I needed.

The context
I have a little app that runs on a internet connected clock that shows the days to Christmas. A little while ago, during December and Jan, the traffic (along with traffic on webmentions.app) spiked hard enough to cause Vercel to block my entire account.
So for the short term, I disabled the countdown app. Christmas, at the time, was a full year away, so I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be missed.

          <p>Hey Hackers!
Since I first needed to style an HTML element with multiple borders, I wondered how great it would be if there were an online tool to help design CSS multiple borders without writing any code. I have recently searched for a tool like that, but haven‚Äôt found any. So, I decided to create Bordiple.
Bordiple is a CSS Multiple Borders generator tool. It allows coders and no-coders to create beautiful borders and share the result with any person using a custom link.
Every feedback will be very welcome. I hope you all enjoy it!

          <p>This is something I&#x27;ve been working on for a while. I&#x27;ve previously shared a video showing the designing and code exporting process of my web/mobile design tool[0]. I still felt at that point that there was a huge disconnect between development and design. I think I&#x27;ve solved that with these special components that allow:
- developers to build their logic using zero effort, placeholder UI
- designers to redesign these UI&#x27;s while testing their work in its final form, in the full context of the application
- developers to accept these ready-to-go designs in a way that doesn&#x27;t clutter the codebase
I oscillate between feeling ecstatic, because I feel like I&#x27;m on the edge of finally solving the back and forth handoff problem I&#x27;ve often dealt with, and some light despair, because I have a very small network (no decision makers) and would struggle to get something even perfect off the ground. I&#x27;m only saying this so someone reading is encouraged to either A) let me know that this is something they want or B) bring me back to reality, and explain why I&#x27;m wasting my time.
Cheers!

          <p>As a UX designer, your primary goal is to create seamless and user-friendly experiences. However, there‚Äôs one huge mistake that could cost you your job: listening only to your client.
No, wait, hear us out‚Ä¶
There is no denying that delivering what your client wants is important, as is client satisfaction. However, it‚Äôs crucial that you, as the UX designer, prioritize the needs and preferences of the end-users throughout the entire design process.
With an eye (and ear) only on your client‚Äôs direction, you can only be driven in one direction, the client‚Äôs vision. With a consistent eye on your user as well as an understanding of your client‚Äôs needs and purpose, you can act as a bridge between the client and end user.

          <p>Hey folks,
I&#x27;m super excited to announce the release of a new UI for Apache Kafka, Confluent, Redpanda and Kinesis that focuses on Teams and Data Mesh. (Note: the desktop version is also very popular with individual developers!)
Why is this important? Because providing a solution that can be used by both IT and business (non-technical) users is essential when building applications that process business data.
Of course, we are mainly developers working on Kadeck. So you won&#x27;t miss any of the features you need to troubleshoot and monitor Kafka and your applications. In fact, we have put a lot of effort into making Kadeck the best UI for Apache Kafka on the market. This includes enterprise features such as fine-grained rights management, topic organisation with data owners, labels and topic (API) documentation, teams and roles as well as LDAP/AD connectivity, data policies and masking, audit log and much more.
I hope you enjoy using Kadeck - either the free version or the Professional/Enterprise version - and please let me know your feedback. I always love to hear about your specific use case!
Have a great day,
Ben

Constantly toggling viewport sizes the other day finally tipped my personal annoyance/action threshold.
The result is WINDED - a simple tool to help you simultaneously view how your website appears on different screen sizes without needing to constantly adjust the size of your browser window.
With a 4K monitor, you can see every Tailwind breakpoint on a single screen! This is game-changing.
Please let me know what you think!

          <p>I‚Äôm not talking about a canvas tag with some WebXR/WebGPU/WebGL. I‚Äôm talking about VR having it‚Äôs ‚Äòworld-wide web‚Äô moment instead of headsets being expensive, digital walled gardens. Seems to me that VR headsets have eaten themselves already. For example, A common criticism of Apple Vision Pro is ‚ÄúWhat problem does this solve? What is the killer app?‚Äù. Before the world-wide web, I believe the home personal computer was primarily used for games, similar to VR right now.
Actual HTML is a poor fit for this solution. Our ‚Äòdocument‚Äô metaphor doesn‚Äôt really translate so well to virtual space unless we‚Äôre doing work designed for the space (like spreadsheets or code). In such a case, floating windows may be appropriate to replace modern desktops. Otherwise, I think we need a protocol and language of some kind to serve and describe virtual space, either from the headsets or larger infrastructure.
Is anyone working something like this?

          <p>A question that comes up from time to time from people learning how to make PDFs accessible concerns the tooltips that you sometimes see displaying the alt text for images ... sometimes you see such them and sometimes you don&#x27;t.

          <p>Manipulating data is core to any programming language. JavaScript is no exception, especially as JSON has token over as a prime data delivery format. One such data manipulation is reversing arrays. You may want to reverse an array to show most recent transactions, or simple alphabetic sorting. Reversing arrays with JavaScript originally was done via [‚Ä¶]

          <p>If you&#x27;ve ever played a full screen web game that popped up an in-game dialog
that you instinctively canceled with the Escape key, you probably found
yourself kicked out of full screen mode.
This frustrating experience is caused by the fact that dialog and full screen
mode &quot;fight&quot; for the Escape key. It&#x27;s an unequal battle because, by default,
full screen mode always wins. But how can you make the dialog the winner for the
Escape key? This is where the Keyboard Lock
API comes into play.

          <p>I&#x27;m currently a SWE working at FAANGMULA, feeling a bit burnt out and exploring other paths within tech. I&#x27;ve been paying much more attention to the design space in tech and have become enamored with the idea of learning how to create similarly beautiful experiences. I&#x27;ve been particularly inspired by Andrew Wilkinson/Metalab, Brian Chesky/AirBNB, Apple, Any Distance, Flighty, etc. As I pay more attention to high quality design and UX, I&#x27;m realizing that outstanding design in and of itself can be enough to launch successful and beautiful software.
I&#x27;ve been searching for high quality online education to study design in a more formal and rigorous manner, something equivalent to the MIT challenge, but all I&#x27;ve found are RISD&#x27;s online certificates which cost $10k, or youtuber/twitter influencer courses. I&#x27;m willing to pay the 10 grand for those courses, but if I&#x27;m going to spend that much I&#x27;d like some validation that its really worth it.
Primarily though, I&#x27;d love to hear from any designers here about how you learned and honed your craft.

I have 100 topics or so thus far. What topics do you suggest that UI/UX practitioners should learn a bit about in a primer?
