          <a href=https://github.com/peaBerberian/str-html target="_blank">Show HN: JavaScript UI Tool Making HTMLElements Based on Template Literals</a>
          <p>I frequently make quick and small JS projects which do not need a complete React + Redux + Webpack environment (too heavy, bothersome to setup, re-learn and debug when it goes wrong).
Until now, I was mainly writing in them simple utils on top of native HTML API like &#x60;document.createElement&#x60; and &#x60;Element.prototype.textContent&#x60;.
However, on a recent project, I just hit a spot where I began to have a lot of nodes, which made this call-based syntax hard to read.
After wondering if I should use React and its nice JSX (leading to a whole setup) or learn another generally-complex UI framework with a nice syntax, I wondered if I could not just implement a solution that would both be readable yet very simple to setup and understand.
So here we comes! It&#x27;s a very young and simple project (meant to be low maintenance), I may have missed some HTML peculiarities and I&#x27;m sure its share of performance gains.
The code is in the &#x60;main.mjs&#x60; file at the root of the repository.

          <p>I am joining a new company, one primarily focused on UI/UX. My role will be on the backend and around infrastructure but since this is a core thing for them, I want to know more.
In particular, what is the best book/resource you would recommend for learning about modern UI/UX: principles, design methodology, practical tips?
It&#x27;s important that it&#x27;s not some foundational text from Bell Labs written in the 60s, although obviously nice if it mentioned a bit of history, but rather something focused on modern stuff, especially mobile apps. How is it actually done today.
Which technologies should I have at least cursory knowledge of, which tools are widely used, which are hip, and which are on the COBOL path? What is the modern approach to measuring and improving user experience?

          <p># WebCodecs integration
WebGPU exposes an API to create opaque &quot;external texture&quot; objects from HTMLVideoElement through importExternalTexture(). You can use these objects to sample the video frames efficiently, potentially in a 0-copy way directly from the source YUV color model data.
However, the initial WebGPU specification did not allow creating GPUExternalTexture objects from WebCodecs VideoFrame objects. This capability is important for advanced video processing apps that already use WebCodecs and would like to integrate WebGPU in the video processing pipeline. WebCodecs integration adds support for using a VideoFrame as the source for a GPUExternalTexture and a copyExternalImageToTexture() call. See the following example, and the chromestatus entry.

          <p>Remote work is more productive. It’s great for the “leave me alone, I’m in the zone” type of work. That kind of work is not enough to make successful things.</p>

          <p>Friction often has a negative connotation in user experience design, but it actually has many benefits. Its best-known use case is mitigating unintended consequences in high-risk scenarios, yet it has a new place in the age of artificial intelligence. Adding strategic friction to interfaces can lead to profound efficiency gains in machine learning algorithms.</p>

          <p>Disabling paste is usually done in the name of security.
For example, let’s say the user has to type their email address twice. Using 2 separate inputs means a mismatch can be caught. But that doesn’t work if they paste an error from the first input into the second.
But disabling paste degrades UX and is a terrible way to stop users from making mistakes.
Here’s why:
Problem #1: It makes the interface feel broken
This is because users expect to be able to paste but instead it just gets ignored with no feedback.

				
			Trying to paste into the password field gets ignored as paste is disabled
	

Problem #2: It slows users down
This is because the user has to type everything again from scratch.

				
			User has to type the password manually because paste is disabled
	

Problem #3: It increases the chance of error
This is because typing manually increases the chance of a mistake.
Give control and let users check answers
To do this consider using:
an email verification step
a ‘check answers’ page
a password reveal</p>

          <p>The value of a prototype is in the insight it imparts, not the code being written. Prototyping lets us fail fast and cheap, or get the data to make a concrete decision on direction. It helps answer the question, &quot;What happens if we try this?&quot;. Most significantly, prototyping provides us with the guardrails to safely and productively fail. Failure is an integral part of the process of learning.</p>

In an era of generalization, where we expect to run x programming language on any OS and architecture, what are some contrarian voices?

          <a href=https://www.feedflow.dev/ target="_blank">Show HN: FeedFlow – a minimalistic and opinionated RSS Reader</a>
          <p>Hey there HN!
I&#x27;m Marco and some time ago I&#x27;ve started (again) to stay up to date with RSS. But I wasn’t completely satisfied with the readers already out there, so I decided to built my own.
What I want for an RSS reader is easily going through my feed and being able to open the article on the respective website. 
That&#x27;s because:
- the majority of websites with an RSS feed don’t share the article’s full content because they want you to go on their website;
- if an article is worth a long read and I want to save it, I’m using a read-it-later app.
- I want to use a “disposable” browser and not my main one for reading, where I can nuke navigation data or auto-handle cookie banners (DuckDuckGo or Firefox Focus).
With that in mind, I decided to start the development of FeedFlow and now it&#x27;s available for Android, iOS and macOS. On the tech side it&#x27;s built with Jetpack Compose for the Android app, Compose Multiplatform for the desktop app, and SwiftUI for the iOS app. And the parsing is done with a library that I&#x27;ve developed called RSSParser: https://github.com/prof18/RSS-Parser
FeedFlow offers a minimalistic feeds list and it opens the articles on their respective websites with the broswer of your choice (on mobile). FeedFlow also supports importing an existing RSS collection through OPML files.
Feel free to ask any questions or share any feedback. Looking forward to it!
- Marco

          <p>I&#x27;ve been reading more blogs and a lot of them have no RSS, just curious how to keep up to date aside from the ones that offer some sort of email update, which I generally try to avoid.

          <a href=https://totalwebtool.com/ target="_blank">Show HN: TotalWebTool – All-In-One Website Analysis (Security, UX and More)</a>
          <p>Hey HN,
My team and I recently released TotalWebTool as an all-in-one solution online to audit your website or web app. We&#x27;ll release more documentation soon on all of the checks performed but it&#x27;s currently over 150 covering technical SEO, security, performance, UX, code errors and accessibility issues. This includes everything from support for must haves like Core Web Vitals and goes all the way up to automated pen-tests (don&#x27;t worry pen-tests are only manually initiated). We expect to continue growing the list of audits.

          <p>With a gradual rollout from Chrome 116, we will be adding the Allow this time option to permission prompts. Our goal is to make it easier for people to use powerful web capabilities on their own terms. Allow this time will initially be available on desktop for some of the most common permissions: geolocation, camera, and microphone. Permission prompts for other capabilities and on the mobile web are unchanged for now, but may change in the future.
If you&#x27;re a site owner, review Impact and Recommendations, and try the demo.
# A new UX for permissions

Users are presented with three options:
Allow: Persistent allow.
Block: Persistent block.
Clicking the x button: Temporary block. The site can prompt the user again later, at most three times.

          <p>Hi All,
Introducing &#x60;bloc-them&#x60;,a tiny (but mighty) JS UI library. Its based on &#x60;Business Logic Components&#x60; design pattern  and hence the name &#x27;bloc-them&#x60;.
A moderate JS developer can learn it in very short span of time: I belive it should be in 15 Minutes up and running.
Ther are only two Classes in whole framework:
&#x60;Bloc&#x60; and &#x60;ListenerWidget&#x60;.
&#x60;Bloc&#x60; publishes new states and &#x60;ListenerWidget&#x60; react to such states.
The complete 15 Minute tutorial is on the GitHub readMe.

          <p>Hello everyone,
For the past several months, I have been building multiple React/TailwindCSS components for my projects.
I have decided to bundle and document them so that I can share them with the community.
The entire UI kit is written in Typescript on top of the class-variance-authority library.
Although I am already using these components in production, the project is still in beta since it lacks a full test suite and dark mode.
Please feel free to take a look and provide feedback if you have a moment to spare.
Thank you!

          <p>All the roads in Austin are awful. It destroys my faith in civil engineering a bit. There’s a couple spots (southbound Burnet near North Loop) where you can catch air on a storm drain if you’re going the speed limit. The extreme Texas heat determines a lot of the road conditions by  warping the asphalt. The giant live oak tree clusters lifting entire sections of concrete do their part as well. But that doesn’t explain all the shoddy patch work rattling your hubcaps off.
There’s a human element happening as well. Some years ago I learned almost anyone can dig up a road. My friend who owns a food trailer park in South Austin told me about this when he connected his sewer main. Get the permits, maybe prove you have the correct equipment, then jackhammer your way through the city road until yo…</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;36939871 target="_blank">Ask HN: How do you measure eng team productivity?</a>
          <p>I’m finding very little resource on this topic. However, it is paramount to follow it as a team grows or a company grows - I’ve known many companies whose developers effectively stopped developing anything of value, being burdened by bugs, bureaucracy, or poor relationships.
To be precise, productivity is the measure of outputs over inputs. In the engineering world, outputs are usually value increments (the definition of which varies according to each team’s mission and expertise. They could be user stories for devs, models for data scientists, terraform changes for ops), and input is time. I would note that I don’t know whether to count maintenance tasks in or out (such as keeping versions up to date) or the output definition. However, anything that does not bring obvious value (bug fixing, refactoring) should be counted out of output in terms of productivity - don’t get me wrong, refactoring is useful and important, because when done well it will improve future productivity. 
The term “team” deserves some definition too. A team in my question has two attributes:
- a common mission
- size between 2 and 7 people
I’m looking for testimonies and knowledge:
- how is productivity measured in your team if you’re an engineer? In different teams if you’re at a management level? Conversely, is it not measured and do you know why?
- how is productivity measured in companies you know, either through firsthand experience or well-documented sources? (Company articles, books)
- are you aware of research in this area?
On a last side note, I would count research displayed in Accelerate out of the productivity question. The DORA metrics don’t delve into the complex details of “what is value for my team” and focus on the release level. The books and research are great, but arguably not about engineering productivity.

          <p>My 11yo daughter has started to express interest in web app development. I run a web agency and my natural inclination would be to teach her a bit of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and then help her to “learn by doing”.
Part of me, however, feels like these technologies risk becoming increasingly irrelevant. Between improvements in low-code/no-code platforms and LLMs that write code for you, I’m not sure how useful these skills will be to her down the road.
What do people think? What are the right tools and technologies nowadays to put in front of a tween interested in software development?

          <p>Complex systems are inherently multifaceted and intricate. They are often not intentionally designed to be understood in an instant. This stands true for both naturally occurring systems like ecosystems and human-designed systems like advanced software or machinery. These systems are a mixture of several components, each having its unique properties and roles. To understand the system as a whole, it&#x27;s vital to comprehend each component and their interactions with each other. This process requires time and, thus, a considerable degree of patience.</p>

Web Components have a marketing problem. I have a lot of opinions about this, so many that I joined the Web Components Community Group.
Too low-level, designed for framework authors. Web Components were designed as a low-level primitive for framework authors, but framework authors were like “nah” because most of their problems were already solved in user-land. Switching to web components and Shadow DOM, despite any performance advantages, would fundamentally upset of some conventions established in these frameworks. Thankfully, support for importing and exporting web components has improved in a lot of frameworks and you can almost use custom elements every…</p>

It&#x27;s an interesting area considering it crosses the boundary of statistics, UX, and knowledge sharing. I often know what a good dashboard looks like when I see it, yet I often can&#x27;t pinpoint exactly what makes it good.

          <p>I have nearly 2,000 unreads in my RSS reader since the last time I zeroed it out.  That’s a lot and sometimes I get overwhelmed. On the positive side, nearly ~1,500 of those posts are from ~30 personal blogs I follow. That makes me happy that friends are posting on their sites and for the state of blogging in general.
While I love RSS, it’s hard for me to “power thru” these personal blogs because… well… they’re personal. They’re more powerful and often more thoughtful and more well-researched than a content mill, more precious. Knowing there’s hundreds of gems in this pile of 1,500 posts slows me down. I want to savor these contributions, but it’s overwhelming like having the next year’s worth of content meals planned out.
Rather than let myself be overwhelmed, I made a deal with myself: One friend a day. I’ll zero out one personal blog a day. Dig in and get to know someone. Some have a handful of unread posts, some have hundreds. In a month or so I’ll finish and I’m sure the hopper will have refilled itself. Hopefully it’s more manageable this time.</p>

          <a href=https://www.readyrunner.ai/ target="_blank">Show HN: ReadyRunner – AI chat tool for productivity, on your desktop</a>
          <p>Website / Download: https://www.readyrunner.ai
Overview Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;qgdlh_aL7P8
I built ReadyRunner with my friend Kaz. We’ve been hacking on software projects together for 15 years. We wanted an AI chat tool that runs on desktop and has a clean UI, so we built ReadyRunner.
ReadyRunner has 3 chat types:
- Assistant Chat: Standard AI chat with a customizable library of system message prompts
- ScratchPad: Collaborate on text/code with the AI in an editor alongside the chat (ScratchPad video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;vnbKLFR1TVs)
- Document Chat: Upload and ask questions about PDF/text documents
ReadyRunner Features:
- Powered by GPT-3 and GPT-4 (which you can switch mid-conversation)
- Quick access hotkey
- Runs on Mac, Windows or Web
- System prompt library (customize assistant behavior in different ways)
- Messages stream from top (so they are easier to read)
- Messages in the assistant&#x27;s memory are marked with a dot (and you can clear history mid-conversation)
Free users get 10 free GPT-3 messages per month. Subscribers get more messages and GPT-4 access. Bring your own key plan for unlimited messages is also available.
Please give ReadyRunner a try and share your feedback.

          <p>Breakpoints let you pause your code in the middle of its execution, on an optional condition, and examine all values at that moment in time. Logpoints let you log messages to the Console without pausing the execution. Breakpoints and logpoints are an efficient alternative to debugger; statements and console.log() calls in your code.
  
  

Watch the video to learn how to use breakpoints and logpoints to debug your code:
Set a breakpoint with a click.
View the Call Stack, inspect variables, and edit their values in Scope and the Console.
Right-click &gt; Ignore third-party scripts.
Disable pausing on debugger; statements.
Add a condition to pause on.
Log values to the Console without pausing.
Set the Debugger to pause on caught or uncaught exceptions.
To learn more about breakpoint types, see Pause your code with breakpoints.</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;36877334 target="_blank">Ask HN: Favorite book on game engine design?</a>
          <p>I love the idea of making games for canvas in-browser. It&#x27;s super fun and generally not very hard to get going with simple stuff. I&#x27;ve made a couple of very simple ( and ugly ) games on canvas already. They&#x27;re not great because I&#x27;m not a game dev, I&#x27;m just some backend dork. As an aside, this has been a great &quot;intro to javascript&quot; for me, haha.
Whether it&#x27;s a good idea to build games in canvas or not is besides the point -- what I really need is a good &quot;introduction to game engine development&quot; so that I can have a stronger base to build my browser games on, and so I can learn the real fundamentals of game design.
What do you recommend?

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;36874100 target="_blank">Ask HN: Is there a good icon font?</a>
          <p>Hello y&#x27;all!
I am currently building a WordPress Gutenberg theme. WordPress still does not support SVGs but it is possible to enqueue custom fonts (e.g. in *.woff2).
Do you know good resources for icon fonts? Basically what font-awesome used to be in its early versions. I could use font-awesome, but i&#x27;ve gotten a little tired of its design.
Thanks!

          <a href=https://www.snipcss.com/ target="_blank">Show HN: SnipCSS – Extract CSS from any website section, turn into components</a>
          <p>Hello HN!  SnipCSS is a Free Chrome extension (with pro version) that I think many web developers would find useful!
If you ever tried to copy styles from devtools to recreate a design you know it&#x27;s very tedious to select each element needed and copy styles. SnipCSS automates that better than anyone.  Nothing else merges/splices styles into a usable snippet that stays true to the original design.
After getting the extension working well enough to collect snippets, I took it a lot further.  I added features to scope the CSS, templatize repeating items, inject lorem ipsum data, and then convert snippets to React/Vue with ChatGPT.
I&#x27;m even building a template directory of snippets based on the designs I&#x27;ve collected from random websites.
Making a universal tool to componentize anything on a web is a big project so it took me a couple years to get here.
During that time I&#x27;ve gotten very little feedback.  I really suck at talking to users.  So please let me know your thoughts and leave a comment!

          <p>When checking PDFs for accessibility it is not OK to just run them through an automated accessibility checker and then publish if the checker finds no issues. And yet, so many organisations still fall into the trap of doing precisely this.

          <p>It’s been great to see digital sustainability become more of a mainstream topic in recent months. With most of Europe baking in a deadly heatwave with unprecedated temperature, the need for action on climate change is more pressing than ever. If you’re not sure what action you, as a developer, can take, my talk from All Day Hey conference provides some facts, figures and starting points for thinking about sustainability in the context of web development.
Although it may seem like a big, scary topic, there’s a lot we can do in terms of mitigating environmental harm in our own work, sharing knowledge and influencing the industry as a whole. I hope you’ll find some useful takeaways here, and be encouraged to join the fight against climate change.

What’s up everybody? I have some great news—in a few short weeks I will be joining CloudCannon as a developer advocate!
And for folks in the Eleventy community, I am delighted to reveal that this move will unlock sponsorship of official open source development time for Eleventy! Importantly, Eleventy will continue on as an independent open source project and I’m excited about the opportunities ahead.

          <a href=https://daverupert.com/2023/07/my-dad-recliner/ target="_blank">My dad recliner</a>
          <p>After five+ years of negotiation with my wife, I got the gift of a wonderful dad-ass recliner for my 43rd birthday. It’s petite and looks like a regular leather dad chair before it’s glorious transformation into a relaxation station. Per tradition, kids aren’t allowed to use dad’s recliner; it’s the one sacred space in our house.
The recliner has been a major boost to my calmness. Having my feet up after a long day of sitting at my desk produces a psychological effect that scientists refer to as “maxin’ and relaxin’”. This is not a sports-dad chair for yelling at my fantasy employees, oh no. This, my lovelies, is a book nook for a grown man. A stack of devices (iPad, Kindle, Macbook) sits piled next to the chair so I can follow whatever whim the Muses enchant me with, as the forefathers intended. President Ben Franklin once wrote in his diary “The secret to Man’s creativity is having a sweet ass recumbent chair.”
This recliner will launch a thousand blog posts. This recliner is where I’ll write the next great American sci-fi novel. This recliner is where I’ll create apps and games late at night after the family goes to sleep. This recliner is where I’ll nod off on lazy Saturday afternoons like a dog in the sun. This recliner is where I’ll store decades and decades of farts until I die and my children’s children judiciously and uncaringly throw it in a dumpster, divorced of sentimentality and awareness of the suitcases of emotional baggage from grandpa’s ancient computer job that I unpacked in this chair.</p>

          <a href=https://daverupert.com/2023/07/liquid-death/ target="_blank">Liquid Death</a>
          <p>I have a brief window of opportunity where my brain is allowing me to change my default drink of choice. It could be my taste buds evolving, some secret recipe update, or the news that the WHO is saying aspartame as “possibly carcinogenic”… but for whatever reason Diet Coke doesn’t taste as good to me as it used to, so I’m making changes. There’s a new beverage in my fridge: Liquid Death.
Liquid Death? Isn’t that just water in a can? Yes, but specifically I’m enjoying the “Grim Leafer”, their agave iced tea. It’s a light flavor – agave-sweet, but not too sweet – an enjoyable step up from drinking boring ol’ water from a can. Although, the water in the ice cold can is delicious, cool, and refreshing. I’ve tried other drinks, but Liquid Death has been the one candidate with enough potential for a successful wholesale switch.
Liquid Death is an interesting product to me. It’s entire brand is: water, but hardcore. As if Monster energy drinks started doing yoga and got passionate about staying hydrated. A weird blend of dad jokes and toxic masculinity applied to water. Why does water have to have skulls? Why not fill up a water bottle?
I guess my answer for that is… I have water bottles. Thousands. I can do that but let’s be honest, sipping on water bottles is boring. A water bottle or double walled tumbler can’t match the tactile thrill of snapping into a cold one… mmm… that’s the user experience I crave. Me, a god, breaking open metal canisters with my bare hands. It’s not that sensational, but there’s a dopamine hit and selfish reward center activated in my brain.
One day I’ll ditch the cans and move over to plain ol’ sun tea or kombucha I brew in a window or closet (respectively). One habit substitution at a time though, starting with eliminating the “possibly carcinogenic” one.</p>

          <p>Hey, this is bam! its a comics app, specifically for Webtoons. Webtoons are vertically scrolling comics (built for mobile phones and popular with younger millennials and Gen Z)
I built a podcast app before this, which 100,000 people use every month, https://podyssey.fm. No one tech company owns podcasts it is a medium that works through RSS feeds.
See this image for a visual on how podcasts work [https://ax0.taddy.org/blog/investment-pitch/podcast-ecosyste...]
See this image for a visual on how bam! works [https://ax0.taddy.org/blog/investment-pitch/taddy-ecosystem....] (its the same!)
If you are a webtoons creator and want to be on the bam! app, you can self-publish your Webtoon, you just have to output a file that conforms to this standard: https://3s-docs.org/comicseries (follow the instructions on how to notify us of your webtoons feed)
If you aren&#x27;t a developer and a webtoons creators, I also build taddy.org (where all you have to do is drag + drop your artwork and creates the feed for you)
Let me know what you think!

Management (FedCM)
features:
Login Hint API: Specify a preferred user account to be
signed in.
User Info API: Fetch the information of the returning user

within an iframe.
RP Context API: Use a title different from &#x27;Sign in&#x27;  in
the FedCM dialog.
Additionally, Chrome is starting an origin
trial for the IdP Sign-In Status
API. The IdP Sign-in Status API is a requirement and will be a
breaking change when it&#x27;s shipped. If you have an existing implementation of
FedCM, make sure to participate in the origin trial.

But since 1950, some marketers have worked in a different direction. To sow confusion and doubt, and most of all, to seek delay. In 1954, facing the real […]</p>

          <p>We often romanticize the notion of programming, presenting it as an abstract form of art, a science, or even a form of magic. The truth, however, is much more practical and grounded. Code, in its essence, is communication. At the start of my book, Learning JavaScript Design Patterns, I say &quot;good code is like a love letter to the next developer who will maintain it&quot;. It is an intimate correspondence, from one developer to another, spanning time and space.</p>

          <p>The comfort zone is a delightful and alluring place - it&#x27;s predictable, familiar, and secure. It&#x27;s the warm and cozy bed we don&#x27;t want to leave on a chilly morning, the worn-in pair of shoes that fit just right, the well-trodden path we instinctively follow. It&#x27;s a sanctuary that offers refuge from the unpredictable, the unfamiliar, the challenging. But as much as the comfort zone appeals to our desire for security, it&#x27;s also a space where progress and growth stagnate.</p>

          <p>For web developers, WebGPU is a web graphics API that provides a unified and fast access to GPUs by exposing modern hardware capabilities and allowing rendering and computation operations on a GPU, similar to Direct3D 12, Metal, and Vulkan.
While it’s true, that story is not complete. WebGPU is first and foremost the result of a collaborative effort including major companies such as Apple, Google, Intel, Mozilla, and Microsoft. Among them, some realized that WebGPU could be more than a Javascript API but a cross-platform graphics API that could be used by developers across ecosystems other than the web. To fulfill the primary goal, a JavaScript API was introduced in Chrome 113. However, another significant project has been developed alongside it: the webgpu.h C API. This C header file list…</p>

In this post, we&#x27;ll cover the multiple components of this launch, including:
What&#x27;s shipping:  The launch process for the relevance and measurement APIs: Topics, Protected Audience, Attribution Reporting, Private Aggregation, Shared Storage, and Fenced Frames.
Gradually enabling the APIs: APIs will be gradually enabled over the course of the 115 milestone while monitoring for issues, aiming for 99% availability by mid-August.

# Programmatically open a Sidepanel
Sidepanel has been one of the most requested features in Chrome extensions and has been available in Chrome since version 114. After launching the Side Panel API, one of the first pieces of feedback that we’ve received was that developers want a way to programmatically open a side panel. And here it is: chrome.sidePanel.open is now in beta. You can use it to open the extension side panel programmatically in response to a user interaction, such as a context menu click:
chrome.contextMenus.onClicked.addListener((info, tab) &#x3D;&gt; {
  if (info.menuItemId &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;openSidePanel&#x27;) {
    // This will open the panel in all the pages on the current window.
    chrome.sidePanel.open({ windowId: tab.windowId });
  }
});

          <p>Hey HackerNews!
I&#x27;m Renat Abyasov, CEO of Wonderslide, and today I&#x27;m thrilled to share our creation with you.
Wonderslide is an AI-powered presentation design tool that saves you time and effort. Simply input your draft, and in seconds, it generates stunning, fully editable PowerPoint slides.
A few years ago, instead of reading a book to my daughter, I found myself creating slides for meetings and conferences. &quot;There must be a way to automate this routine,&quot; I thought. Then, I met a group of like-minded people who envisioned robots creating presentations instead of humans.
We had little more than a dream when we were just starting — a dream to stop wasting precious time on presentations. And now, after many countless iterations, we&#x27;re finally ready to reveal our AI designer to the world.
Key Features:
 • Automated slide layout and redesign with one click
 • ML-based image and icon matching
 • AI-powered text editing
 • Native export to .pptx
The AI designer seamlessly applies your content to the layout, incorporating color schemes, images, and icons, all optimized with the golden ratio in mind.
Under the hood, our neural networks analyze and structure different types of content, while the ChatGPT API helps highlight key points and condense text. The result is a range of slide versions for you to choose from.
Try Wonderslide now and let us know your thoughts! Has it made creating presentations more efficient? Did it enhance the visual appeal? Is the user interface intuitive? Your feedback is invaluable as we strive to improve our service.

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/debugging-chrome-on-ios/ target="_blank">Debugging websites in Chrome on iOS 16.4+</a>
          <p>From Chrome 115 you can enable Safari Web Inspector debugging for Chrome on iOS. This post explains how to get started.
Prior to Chrome 115, debugging webpages required building Chrome for iOS from source, as the release version of WKWebView did not support remote Web Inspector debugging. In Chrome 73, we added the chrome://inspect page which locally displays JavaScript logs to assist in debugging webpages. Now that WKWebView allows Web Inspector debugging in release (as of iOS 16.4), we have added a setting in Chrome 115 to enable this feature and further improve the developer experience.
# Getting started
On your iOS device you need:
iOS 16.4 or greater.
Chrome 115 or greater.
On your Mac you need:
The Safari Develop menu enabled. Enable this from Safari application settings, Advanced Settings tab.
On your iOS device launch the Chrome app and navigate to Settings. In Content Settings, enable Web Inspector. Relaunch Chrome for iOS after changing this setting.
# Debugging your site
With the setting enabled, you can debug any page running in Chrome for iOS by following these steps.

          <p>Following on from my hard and easy way of getting timezone from an IP address, having the timezone (as text) is one thing, now finding the actual offset is entirely a different problem.

TL:DR; jump to the spoiler if you can&#x27;t be bothered to read/listen to me ramble!
The problem isn&#x27;t timezones, it&#x27;s day light saving
It&#x27;s all very well knowing what timezone a particularly location is sitting on. We can show the user the UTC time, but when it doesn&#x27;t match the wall clock because they&#x27;re currently observing DST, then it&#x27;s just…weird.
So now we need to know if the location is observing DST, or not. Or if perhaps they never observe DST (like Hawaii).
The long hard way
There is the IANA timezone dataset which has custom data structures that describe the location and how time is observed in that…</p>

          <p>Hey,
David Cain has a lot of very good thoughts out there on his blog. When I read the current article »don’t forget to swim now and then«, I wholeheartedly agreed to many aspects in it. We people strive for activities our bodies and brains adapted to over eons, while we struggle a lot with modern and/or activities we are not a adapted to: Politics (too abstract, unpredictable), telecommunication (unreal, missing sensoric information), and others. What I think is interesting about it is that it explains why we relax when going for a swim or run, hiking, sitting in nature around a fireplace, go camping (despite it is uncomfortable compare to our home). And it’s why we are stressed when being in meetings, watching TV, news all day. Leo Babauta has some helpful ideas on how to let go of sacre…</p>

          <p>I just bought a house that has a really weird layout. Previous owner had it split for a rental unit and I&#x27;m taking over the whole house. It needs a lot of work and I&#x27;m pretty handy when it comes to the work but not when it comes to know how to layout rooms / spaces and even less when it comes to design. I&#x27;m already looking for a professional interior designer but I&#x27;d also like to play with some layouts myself as well.

          <p>Here&#x27;s what you need to know:
Use ScrollTimeline and ViewTimeline to create scroll-driven animations that enhance user experience.
Fenced frames work along other Privacy Sandbox APIs to embed relevant content while preventing unnecessary context sharing.
With the Topics API the browser can share information with third parties about a user&#x27;s interests while preserving privacy.
And there’s plenty more.
I’m Adriana Jara. Let’s dive in and see what’s new for developers in Chrome 115.
# Scroll driven animations
Scroll-driven animations are a common UX pattern on the web. A scroll-driven animation is linked to the scroll position of a scroll container.
This means that as you scroll up or down, the linked animation goes forward or backward in direct response.
The following examples demonstrate so…</p>

          <p>So far, 2023 has been a busy year in the world of Chrome extensions. Your valuable feedback has allowed us to improve the extension platform and our documentation. We also continue collaborating with other browser vendors in the WebExtensions Community Group so that extension APIs work more consistently across browsers.
In this post, we’ll share with you a few changes that the Chrome extension team has worked on during the first half of this year and what upcoming features will be released later this quarter. Let&#x27;s get started!

          <p>I wonder if I am the only one! I tried Fitness+ a few times (the meditation part for now, really), and it&#x27;s almost impossible to navigate. They focus on teachers, nothing is grouped or wrongly grouped.
The health app as well. It&#x27;s just a randomly generated dashboard and super hard to navigate. I can see that they mimiced the Health app design for Fitness+ to some degree.
Like is this a new trend, or is nobody from Apple themselves actually using these apps?

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;36691782 target="_blank">Ask HN: Thunderbird for RSS?</a>
          <p>Am I the only one using Thunderbird strictly as an RSS client? I&#x27;ve seen countless RSS clients recommended here over the years but none ever have the features to make me switch, mainly due to lacking extension support (for things like uBlock Origin and Bypass Paywalls) or privacy concerns from not running on a local Linux desktop. (I haven&#x27;t heavily used the e-mail functionality in Thunderbird in over two decades. I haven&#x27;t tried the Chat or any other functionality at all.)
Is there something I&#x27;m missing out on? Is there a client with all the same features and then some that I just haven&#x27;t found yet? I&#x27;ve looked at Feedly, Inoreader, and many others through the years but none have risen to the level of replacement. It&#x27;s not broken so I&#x27;m not looking to fix it but I&#x27;m open to hearing how others manage their feeds to see if there&#x27;s any possible improvements I&#x27;ve overlooked.
Full disclosure: I&#x27;ve donated in the past to Thunderbird/Mozilla, including company matches.

          <p># What’s new with scroll-driven animations?
Scroll-driven animations are a way to add interactivity and visual interest to your website or web application, triggered by the user&#x27;s scroll position. This can be a great way to keep users engaged and make your website more visually appealing.
          
In the past, the only way to create scroll-driven animations was to respond to the scroll event on the main thread. This caused two major problems:
Scrolling is performed on a separate process and therefore delivers scroll events asynchronously.
Main thread animations are subject to jank.
This makes creating performant scroll-driven animations that are in-sync with scrolling impossible or very difficult.
We are now introducing a new set of APIs to support scroll-driven animations, which you can…</p>

For a more hands-on experience, see the Record, replay, and measure user flows tutorial.
The DevTools team is actively developing the Recorder panel and has added the following new capabilities since the video came out. Now you can:
Export and share your recordings in various formats, including custom ones.
Slow down the replay and debug during the recording:

Inspect the code of the recording.
Set breakpoints and execute step by step.
Edit steps both during the recording and after.
Install extensions to expand the Recorder capabilities.
Customize the Recorder by building an extension yourself.

          <p>I&#x27;ve been branching out from my usual Game Boy folly and have been tinkering with the Wonder Swan (an interesting little Japanese exclusive handheld). The original Wonder Swan can do eight shades of grey and has no backlight (very much like the original Game Boys for viewing).
Given my experience with Game Boys and recent (basic) electronics, I thought I&#x27;d try my hand at a backlight mod (where LEDs are used light up behind the display). I&#x27;m pretty happy with the final result and this is how I did it.

Build steps
For the backlight, I used a faulty DS Lite display - both bottom or top screen will work as we&#x27;re only interested in the LED and filters.

From the DS Lite display, remove the metal shielding from the back, remove the front polarizer (I&#x27;m guessing) and then separate the back (whit…</p>

          <p>Hi HN, I am in the market for a new monitor and would like to ask you guys for some recommendations.
My requirements are:
- Good for frontend work. High DPI, high resolution. Not excessively blurry, or retina-like. Good color representation.
- Single monitor setup.
- Be able to see 3 screens side by side comfortably, with my coding screen at minimum 16px font size
- Around 1-1.5k.
- Can be driven by a Macbook Pro
I am currently comparing a Dell 43&quot; 4K Ultrasharp screen (dell u4323qe)  vs a LG 40&quot; Ultrawide 5kx2k (lg 40wp95c-w). I don&#x27;t have any experience using an ultrawide vs a very large screen so feedback around that decision (or recommendations of other monitors) would be very useful.
