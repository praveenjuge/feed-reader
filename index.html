          <p>Recently I was reading about fluid simulation and stumbled upon the Gauss Seidel method. I got interested in how it works and made a program that visualizes the method in action.
I had the idea of making an interactive book-like thing for a while, so took this as a chance to do just that.
Note that touch input doesn&#x27;t work and the layout is targeted towards bigger screens, so it doesn&#x27;t function properly on mobile.
It was fun to make and I wanted to share it. Maybe someone will find it useful. Corrections and feedback are welcome.
Technical Stuff
- A single 1.7MB HTML file with embedded JavaScript and WebAssembly. You can save this single file and double click it to run.
- A math typesetter from scratch in C that compiles/renders the equations in real-time (uses KaTex fonts and STB true type to rasterize the fonts).
- Platform code is done using Sokol (tested on windows and web).
- The UI is done using Dear ImGui (Most of the code is done in C++ to use ImGui without a wrapper except for the equations compiler).

          <p>Hi! Genie Builder is a free VSCode plugin that makes it easy to build web GUIs for Julia applications (and in future, Python apps too). Users can simply drag &amp; drop UI elements to create interactive dashboards and data apps, without writing any frontend code.
The tool is designed for data scientists and researchers who need to expose their data models to business users with an interactive web application, but lack the software development skills to build one.
Genie Builder completely eliminates the need to learn frontend development to code the UI. And very soon, we’re also going to support one-click cloud deployments to make it easy to build AND deploy data apps - no frontend nor devops skills required.
I’m Adrian, the creator of the open-source Genie web framework (https://genieframework.com/). Genie offers low-code libraries for building data applications - just like Streamlit or Dash, but for JuliaLang. We developed Genie Builder because of feedback from our open source community who needs more productive data tooling.

          <p>So, recently i started giving out interviews. I have 7+ years of experience so one or two design rounds are expected. 
Keeping that in mind i revised my concepts on distributed system and read few famous papers on distributed system. it was fun visiting those concepts again.
Also, as advised i watched few scaling videos on youtube (i.e Design Uber etc.)
I have experience building system from scratch and depending upon the requirement i have scaled few services in my organization.
So, my expectations from the design round was to have open-ended discussion with interviewer on certain component and discussing drill-down component architecture, scaling issues, drawbacks etc.
But For me at least, reality is quite different. I was asked to design BookMyShow ( Movie booking system ) in full. I mean the interviewers expectation was to just draw the components, write the api and design schema. He will understand my work by looking into it.
I have given 5+ interviews as of now ( got offer from some of them). But i feel like design round wasn&#x27;t justified.

          <p>July 2022 was a bit of a country music song. A friend’s brother passed away while she was visiting, nearly everyone we know got COVID, took my broken guitar to get fixed by the guy that fixes Willie’s guitar, got a flat tire on the family car, the oil change on my pickup truck turned into thousands of dollars worth of repairs, and I lost my AirPods. Somehow, despite all that, July was a good month.
Escape to California

In mid-July we escaped the Texas heat and headed to gloomy sunny San Diego, California for my wife’s birthday. My wife grew up going to Mission Beach every summer, so upon marriage I inherited a family vacation to San Diego. We went every year until our son was three and then we were juggling small babies and the entire extended family couldn’t fit under one roof, so it fel…</p>

          <p>Productivity timers needed to be triggered manually before each task, Making it a chore by itself, Often leading to us not using them after a while and They don&#x27;t take health into consideration.
Health timers are intrusive, Even then they are not always accurate and They don&#x27;t take productivity into consideration.
Butt Mover addresses those problems by using a butt trigger for automatically starting the productivity timer when we sit on the chair before our workstation and a break timer which reminds us to take a walk automatically when we get up.
Butt Mover also incentivizes its usage through a Game. When the health(tasks/breaks) reaches zero its game over.
I&#x27;ve been iterating different forms of Butt Mover over past two years and released the web application earlier this year(After feedback from several HN users). Today I&#x27;m making the core application open-source as I&#x27;ve committed myself to make the Health &amp; Education applications I build open-source.
I hope you&#x27;d use Butt Mover for yourself and build Butt Trigger for others to improve productivity and health. Feedback and contributions to improve the project is appreciated.

          <a href=https://daveceddia.com/clean-up-merged-git-branches/ target="_blank">Delete Git Branches That Have Been Merged</a>
          <p>Got a lot of old git branches hanging around? Here’s a little script
that will delete the branches that have been marged.
It’ll print out the branches to be deleted, and then prompt for whether
you want to delete them.
If your top-level branch isn’t called “main”, customize the MAIN
variable to match.
Script: Delete old git branches
#!/bin/bash

# Change this to match the name of your top level branch
MAIN&#x3D;main

echo &quot;These branches have been merged into $MAIN and will be deleted:&quot;
echo
git branch --merged $MAIN | grep -v &quot;^\* $MAIN&quot;
echo

read -p &quot;Continue? [y/N] &quot; -n 1 -r
echo
if [[ ! $REPLY &#x3D;~ ^[Yy]$ ]]
then
  exit 1
fi

git branch --merged $MAIN | grep -v &quot;^\* $MAIN&quot; | xargs -n 1 -r git branch -d
Copy/paste this into a file in your repo or elsewhere (like
git-cleanup.sh) and make it executable with chmod +x git-cleanup.sh
Bonus: if you want this file to be ignored, but you don’t want to
clutter up the shared .gitignore file with your own local scripts, you
can edit .git/info/exclude and list this file there. That file works
as a local gitignore.

          <p>The new Performance insights panel in DevTools is an experiment that addresses your pain points when analysing the performance of your website.
This is a preview feature from Chrome 102. Our team is actively working on this feature and we are looking for your feedback for further enhancements.
The new Performance insights panel does the following:
Streamlines performance data and focuses on three key metrics: Core Web Vitals.
Supports use-case-driven analysis.
Identifies issues and suggests actionable insights.
Doesn&#x27;t require deep browser expertise to use.
With the Performance insights panel, boost the performance of your website in three steps:
Record the performance.
Get a straightforward overview.
Identify performance issues at a glance and get a list of actionable insights on how to fix them.
Watch the video above to learn how to record the performance, navigate the overview, and get insights.
To understand the three key metrics, see Core Web Vitals.

Chrome 105 beta was released on August 4, 2022 and is expected to become the stable version in late August, 2022.
# Remove WebSQL in non-secure contexts
WebSQL in non-secure contexts is deprecated. The Web SQL Database standard was first proposed in April 2009 and abandoned in November 2010. Gecko never implemented this feature and WebKit deprecated it in 2019. The W3C encourages Web Storage and IndexedDb for those needing alternatives.
Developers should expect that WebSQL itself will be deprecated and removed when usage is low enough. For more information, see Deprecating Web SQL.

I&#x27;ve seen Google&#x27;s UX certificate course going around [0], and was wondering if people had any experience with it or any other similar course teaching people UX design. Any recommendations for course to take, or what might be helpful for getting into this area?

          <p>Who do you talk to when you have architectural questions? Where do you get feedback on design options? When you want to discuss tradeoffs of those options who do you talk that over with?
I am one of two technical cofounders for a small software company. We have really good discussions about the design of our product. I am pretty good at searching. We are comfortable weighing alternatives and making a decision and living with the consequences. All that said, sometimes I want to discuss with other people some of the design challenges we face, or seek input on how people have approached the problem.
Are there fora that you enjoy for such discussion? It seems that it does not fit with the theme of most Q&amp;A sites. Most IRC channels I know of are pretty focused on their own specific topic.

          <p>Research and testing make designs better. You might have seen this play out first hand, by running your own tests before iterating on concepts or working with user researchers to design a new feature.
You may have relied on user research to improve ease of use, reduce friction, and identify changes to include in your next design sprint. And that’s because user research leads to more efficient, informed design initiatives.
But we have a secret. Sometimes…research isn’t always necessary.
That doesn’t mean you should start going into every UX design project blindly, but there are times when you don’t need to dot every “i” and cross every “t”.
As always, prioritization is critical. You know you don’t have endless time to test your designs. You need to assess what needs to be tested right now, …</p>

          <p>Chrome 105 introduces two new methods on the NavigateEvent of the Navigation API (introduced in 102) to improve on methods that have proved problematic in practice. intercept(), which let&#x27;s developers control the state following the navigation, replaces transitionWhile(), which proved difficult to use. The scroll() method, which scrolls to an anchor specified in the URL, replaces restoreScroll() which does not work for all types of navigation.
In this article, I&#x27;ll explain the problems with both and how the new methods fix those problems.

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/has-with-cq-m105/ target="_blank">@container and :has(): two powerful new responsive APIs landing in Chromium 105</a>
          <p>Container queries and :has() are a match made in responsive heaven. Luckily, both of these features are landing together in Chromium 105. This is a huge release with two highly-requested features for responsive interfaces!
# Container Queries: a quick summary
Container queries enable developers to query a parent selector for its size and styling information, making it possible for a child element to own its responsive styling logic, no matter where it lives on a web page.
Instead of relying on the viewport for styling input such as available space, developers now have the ability to query the size of in-page elements too. This capability means that a component owns its responsive styling logic. This makes the component much more resilient, as the styling logic is attached to it, no matter …</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/has-m105/ target="_blank">:has(): the family selector</a>
          <p>Since time began (In CSS terms), we&#x27;ve worked with a cascade in various senses. Our styles compose a &quot;Cascading Style Sheet&quot;. And our selectors cascade too. They can go sideways. In most cases they go downwards. But never upwards. For years, we&#x27;ve fantasized about a &quot;Parent selector&quot;. And now it&#x27;s finally coming! In the shape of a :has() pseudo selector.
The :has() CSS pseudo-class represents an element if any of the selectors passed as parameters match at least one element.
But, it&#x27;s more than a &quot;parent&quot; selector. That&#x27;s a nice way to market it. The not so appealing way might be the &quot;conditional environment&quot; selector. But that doesn&#x27;t have quite the same ring to it. How about the &quot;family&quot; selector?
# Browser Support
Before we go any further, it&#x27;s worth mentioning browser support. It&#x27;s not…</p>

          <p>I am looking for anything you do that helps you get stuff done, even stuff you are not passionate about. Although I&#x27;ve come across many useful tips here on HN, listed later, I still struggle. Some days I just can&#x27;t code at all. probably got sleep apnea.
Some stuff that has helped me on good days
- light cardio first thing or in noon
- good sleep
- not being stuck at some code
- deadlines not created by me (but leads to burn out)
- working closely with other people (PM, fellow dev)
- being in flow, hitting trifecta of skills match + interest match + support match
- air circulation and quiet environment, coldish temperature, multiple places to sit/lay
- informal culture and small team
- no ambiguity
- no bad blood between me and mgmt/boss/company/teammates
- create 3 todo item list daily
What else? what&#x27;s your morning routine?
I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s even about passion, I had all intentions and passion when I was working on my own project, but I worked 10 hours a day for a week and then never could work on it again, ended up selling it for few grand mostly to not see it rot.
TLDR: Extremely low stamina/energy and procrastination

A well-coded, feature-filled WYSIWYG HTML editor can distinguish between a CMS users love and one they can’t stand.  While all WYSIWYG editors have a set of basic functionality, the power of plugins enhances the editing experience.

You can now specify a crop area using region capture
when using getDisplayMedia() to capture the current tab.
Media query syntax can be written using
mathematical comparison operators.
Shared Element Transitions starts an
origin trial.
And there&#x27;s plenty more.
I&#x27;m Pete LePage. Let&#x27;s dive in and
see what&#x27;s new for developers in Chrome 104.
# Specify a crop area with region capture
getDisplayMedia() makes it possible to create a video stream from the current
tab. But, there are times when you don’t want the entire tab, only a small
portion of it. Until now, the only way to do that was to manually crop each
video frame.
With Region Capture, a web app can define the specific area of the screen it
wants to share. For example, Google Slides could allow you to stay i…</p>

          <p>We&#x27;re building an app that helps people manage their schedule, tasks and notes all in one place.
The goal is to create a workspace, where people can manage their various priorities, both personal and professional, see a single schedule combined of all their calendars and manage their days without switching between multiple apps.
At the moment we&#x27;ve implemented Google calendar synchronisation, basic tasks and notes. Also Emery has some things we really wanted to see in other apps – private notes for meetings, categories that can be used to group tasks/notes/meetings together, weekly productivity reports.
Happy to hear any feedback and answer any questions!

          <p>It seems obvious to me that something like RSS would make a great events publication format, and I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has already thought of this.
Say I would like to follow the events of my local art gallery and the local gigs of a certain musician. The gallery and musician could put out a feed which I could follow, with values including date-time, address, info-url, ticket-url, details. My event-feed reader would pull in the gallery&#x27;s and musician&#x27;s events from their website, and populate a calendar with them. Moreover, I could set the reader to only display events in the region I care about, so the only gigs of the musician that would appear would be the ones when they come to my town.
They seems a simple, decentralised way of following events, but I&#x27;m surprised nothing like this already exists?

          <p>If you like math and CSS, you’ll love this one. We don’t need to use media queries to change the values of some CSS properties — *font-size*, *padding*, *margin* etc. — depending on the viewport width, with the CSS &#x60;clamp&#x60; function. But: we still need to use media queries for changing colors, borders, shadows and other CSS styles.</p>

          <p>Until now, the Async Clipboard API supported a limited set of
MIME types to be copied to and pasted from the system clipboard, specifically: text/plain,
text/html, and image/png. The browser typically sanitizes this to, for example, remove embedded
script elements or javascript: links from an HTML string, or to prevent PNG
decompression bomb attacks.
In some cases, though, it can be desirable to support unsanitized content on the clipboard:
Situations where the application deals with the sanitization itself.
Situations where it&#x27;s crucial for the copied data to be identical with the pasted data.
For such cases, the Async Clipboard API now supports web custom formats that let developers write
arbitrary data to the clipboard.

          <p>Hi I can find easily courses books with technicalities of spark and technologies .
What I cannot find are good courses for designing meaning for choosing partition keys, folder structure, pipeline stages (do you want a cleanup phase and when not etc).
Here is a good random post I found https://www.google.com/amp/s/hub.packtpub.com/common-big-data-design-patterns/amp/
https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Typical-four-layered-big-data-architecture-ingestion-processing-storage-and_fig1_329368513
Is there something better than such random posts like books courses? All I find is courses that are either too low level with technicalities or top high levels.
Yeah I know there is the data intensive applications I read it and it&#x27;s not dealing with these specific design decisions its more of 40 k feel look.

          <a href=https://github.com/geoffsdavis/tape-measure target="_blank">Show HN: TapeMeasure – Swift class for creating segmented, labeled lines in UI</a>
          <p>TapeMeasure is a utility class, written in Swift, for generating a visual tape measure, or any other graphical elements that need layout in a measured sequence.
I created this class to help with a pet project I&#x27;m working on, where I needed to generate segmented, labeled lines to use as axes on charts and graphs. It occurred to me that this seems to be a pretty common task, involving a lot of boilerplate code and tedious calculations. Why not decouple the code and move it into a dedicated class? It&#x27;s self-contained, nice and simple, and easy to unit test.
It can also handle a lot of tweaks to the &quot;tape measure&quot;, such as boundary clipping and shifting offsets. It&#x27;s especially good for animation, where you can just change a parameter or two during animation, and call for the re-calculated data to re-render your measured line. That makes it great for animated sliding and scaling effects.
Anyway, enjoy!

          <p>So here we go, our rebranding is done. New logo, new domain, what could go wrong.
We provide a tool to convert design files between Figma, XD, Sketch, Figma, PDF and more and have recently rebranded it from &quot;XD2Sketch&quot; to &quot;Magicul&quot;. We started out as a simple tool to allow users to import XD files in Sketch hence the name XD2Sketch but soon added more features. The name just didn&#x27;t make sense anymore. Magicul initially seemed to be a great name, but turned out to be a bit of an interesting pick when translated to French.
We&#x27;ve sent out a newsletter to our customers to let them know about the changes and here&#x27;s what one of our users replied:
Hey folks,
While I understand that you guys probably hope to operate primarily in English, I think it needs to be mentioned that your brand name &quot;Magicul&quot; in french, literally means &quot;Magical ass&quot;... but the real kicker is the .io of the domain, which literally means input &amp; output...
So here goes the bad news... The entire french community is reading your brand name - literally - as: Magical ass (dot) in &amp; out.
And then there&#x27;s the logo itself... which is a hole with a hat.
Christ. You can&#x27;t make this stuff up. This is ugh, umm, a brutally unfortunate brand?...lol
I&#x27;m in Quebec, Canada, where french is dominant and so I&#x27;m keenly aware of this - and so are my partners, colleagues and friends. We all had a good laugh.
Don&#x27;t know what else to say...?
Bonne chance mes amis!
Have a good one,
- A fan of your work in Montreal.

I just thought this was too hilarious to not share.

          <p>I’m not dying, but before I do I want to share with you — future generations of rockers — what I know about putting on a live music rock show.
The audience’s energy will match your energy. If you stand like a turd on the stage, they audience will stand like a bunch of turds. If you bob your head, they’ll bob their heads. If you move around, they’ll move around. If you show low confidence, they’ll have low confidence in you and start checking out.
Don’t let your band drama show on stage. Every band has drama, but don’t let it show on stage. The audience isn’t there for that.
Practice setting up and tearing down efficiently. Don’t make the audience wait and don’t be “that guy” who drags out setup extra long as some weirdo passive-aggressive attention seeking move. See previous rule.
No matter how big the stage, setup as close to each other as possible. Look and feel like a combined unit of people making music. Trust me, it will be more impressive.
The bassist and the drummer should stand next to each other. It’s all about the bass guitar and the kick drum locking in together.
Never leave the van unattended during load-in or load-out. If you haven’t had your gear stolen at this point, it’s a miracle.
Lead guitar gets the attention, but the bass guitar brings the sex. Flashy medleys get attention, but people feel the bass, no matter how boring.
Don’t riff stage banter. It’s hard to be witty on the fly unless you are very, very witty. Have some prepared goofs or smalltalk.
Make friends with the soundboard operator. This person ultimately controls how good you sound and can make or break you.
“Come forward to the stage” is at best a one-time suggestion. You can’t control people, never ask more than once.</p>

          <p>Blogging. The quintessential starter project for most—if not all—site generators. Here’s a few samples:
Next.js guides new developers to Learn Next.js “by creating a very simple blog app.”
Gatsby’s tutorial guides folks to create their “first Gatsby site: a blog site…”
Remix’s home page has a prominent Get Started call to action button that links to their Blog Tutorial.
Given that Markdown is a very popular document format for blogging, this gives us the opportunity to compare the performance of different site generators for this pervasive use case (highlighted on each generator’s documentation, as noted above).
Let’s see how each generator stacks up when consuming markdown files from the local project’s file system and building into a production-ready project.

          <p>At the beginning of the pandemic, Joe McCann wrote a speculative future piece called The New, New World Order (use a private tab if Medium paywalls you). Predicting the future or forecasting trends is never exact work, but Joe made some thought-provoking claims even if everything doesn’t pan out as predicted.
My favorite claim —and the one I still think about today— was the one about Cloud-work vs. Land-work. Dividing the labor force based on whether you work on the cloud or you work on the land is some sci-fi shit. A new dichotomy for a new era. I can already imagine cloud workers wearing silver jumpsuits and land workers wearing beige jumpsuits.

Jokes aside, I find Cloud-work vs. Land-work an innovative way to frame job types. It breaks away from the tired “blue collar” and “white colla…</p>

          <p>Olivia Hoskin
      Writer &amp; Design Enthusiast 

Muted colors in design can help your audiences enjoy a new peace of mind that emanates from low saturation or chroma — just like the color palettes in this collection.
Quite literally the “opposite of saturated” these designs are subtly elegant. As vivid colors of our past are slowly replaced with harmonious combinations of green, orange, beige, and other shades of “calm” we can enjoy feelings of safety, familiarity, and nurture.
Muted color palettes bring a modern and genuine look and feel to any design project. Perfect for a conscious product or brand, muted colors can be added to anything from packaging to illustrations, to logo color schemes.

          <p>Here’s a tiny CSS tip for making staggered animations feel waaaay more natural: Negative animation delay. I’ve seen this idea shared by master CSS animators Jhey and Amit on separate occasions, and it’s such a neat little trick that it’s worth recording here!
Let’s say we have a group of elements, and we want them to animate in turn on a loop — such as this wavy text example. We’re calculating the animation-delay value them using a custom property corresponding to the element’s index.

With the Console API, you can:
Log, filter, and group the messages.
Interact with the current page.
Log variables.
Log and display object in various formats: tables, HTML elements, JSON objects.
Count function calls.
Display stack traces.
Measure the time elapsed between two points in code.
For a more hands-on learning experience, follow the Log messages in the Console interactive tutorial.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32250823 target="_blank">Ask HN: What are some good resources for micro service design?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;m still quite early in my career, only at my second SW Dev job. My previous position was a monolith app with arguably poor design resulting in large parts of the app being very tightly coupled when they shouldn&#x27;t be. Obviously this make testing some parts of the app very difficult  and of course those were the critical parts of them app (our integration test suite took over 24 hours to run at one point).
When I joined my current company they were in the process of breaking down their monolith into micro services which based on my work at my previous position seemed like a much better alternative. After some time here I feel like I&#x27;m unsure whether or not micro services are as amazing as they need to be but I&#x27;m currently chalking it up to my inexperience with them. It seems like there needs to be a balance of making sure that each service has a limited responsibility while also not having services too interdependent.
So basically I would like to learn more about good design practices and pitfalls to avoid. What resources have you guys used to learn more about micro services?

          <p>I discovered RSS a few days back and have been searching around for good blogs to fill my feed. 
I found a few great blogs here on HN:
[1] https://alien.slackbook.org/blog/
[2] https://acoup.blog/
[3] https://scholars-stage.org/
Are there any other active blogs that fill this template of long and deep discussions on a particular topic by an individual?
I&#x27;m particularly interested in books, philosophy and electronics blogs though any topic will do as long as it&#x27;s not deep level programming.
It doesn&#x27;t necessarily need to have an RSS feed because I&#x27;ll try some workarounds if it is interesting enough.
Though not particularly related, old-style one-man informative sites (and not blogs) are also welcome.

          <p>This summer marks the summer my kids got online. I gave them “the talk” and set down some ground rules.
Never send a photo of yourself to a stranger.
What you say online is the same as saying it in person. If you’re a mean person online, it’s the same as being mean in person.
No spamming. Conversations are a back and forth.
It’s okay to leave the chatroom if you’re uncomfortable.
Hopefully this sets a good foundation for “being online”. It’s earlier than we planned, but with friends’ travel schedules, COVID quarantines, and Texas heat advisories; parent-initiated Zooms and FaceTimes weren’t scaling. We’re now letting the kids self-govern their online hangouts through FaceTime and Messenger Kids. We’ve been conservative about what our kids can do with their devices (time limits, age/content restrictions, parent approval to download/buy, no open chat, etc) and some of those levers will stay in place, but it’s the beginning of a new era.
There’s already been some timezone-related 5:00 AM calls made, but hopefully with a bit more nudging around social norms this goes well.</p>

If you’ve worked with events, you know that preventDefault() and stopPropagation() are frequently used to handle events. One thing you probably didn’t know: there’s a defaultPrevented proptery on events! Consider the following block of code: […]

          <p>Hello HN, my name is Chris. My team and I are excited to announce the launch of our new open source UI component library called Skeleton.
We&#x27;ve been hard at work for several months and am thrilled to finally pull back the curtain. The goal is to put it out there, let folks go hands on, and gather any feedback we can. If there&#x27;s bug, a component you would like to see added etc., then we want to know so we can continue to grow and make this better for everyone.
Being open source, we welcome any contributions from the community. If you&#x27;re interested in joining, you can find us on Github:
https://github.com/Brain-Bones/skeleton
And yes, we realize that the combination of Svelte and Tailwind may place us in a niche. Personally speaking, we&#x27;ve had a lot of success with these technologies in the real world. We love what Rich Harris and his team are bringing to the frontend space with Svelte and SvelteKit, and have found Tailwind to be a great boon when creating design systems for web-based apps We&#x27;re really hoping Skeleton can bridge the gap and provide the best of both worlds, while saving you the time of recreating these components yourself.
That&#x27;s really the biggest benefit of Skeleton - the tight integration between Svelte and Tailwind CSS. It utilizes Tailwind’s utility classes to customize and extend the look and feel of each component. Then pairs this with Svelte’s awesome component architecture. This allows you to create customized, responsive, and reactive interfaces with surprisingly minimal effort.
Of course, feel free to try it out for yourself. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out. I&#x27;m excited to see what everyone can produce with Skeleton!
Thanks!

          <p>Hello HN, my name is Chris. My team and I are excited to announce the launch of our new open source UI component library called Skeleton.
We&#x27;ve been hard at work for several months and am thrilled to finally pull back the curtain. The goal is to put it out there, let folks go hands on, and gather any feedback we can. If there&#x27;s bug, a component you would like to see added etc., then we want to know so we can continue to grow and make this better for everyone.
Being open source, we welcome any contributions from the community. If you&#x27;re interested in joining, you can find us on Github:
https://github.com/Brain-Bones/skeleton
And yes, we realize that the combination of Svelte and Tailwind may place us in a niche. Personally speaking, we&#x27;ve had a lot of success with these technologies in the real world. We love what Rich Harris and his team are bringing to the frontend space with Svelte and SvelteKit, and have found Tailwind to be a great boon when creating design systems for web-based apps We&#x27;re really hoping Skeleton can bridge the gap and provide the best of both worlds, while saving you the time of recreating these components yourself.
That&#x27;s really the biggest benefit of Skeleton - the tight integration between Svelte and Tailwind CSS. It utilizes Tailwind’s utility classes to customize and extend the look and feel of each component. Then pairs this with Svelte’s awesome component architecture. This allows you to create customized, responsive, and reactive interfaces with surprisingly minimal effort.
Of course, feel free to try it out for yourself. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out. I&#x27;m excited to see what everyone can produce with Skeleton!
Thanks!

          <p>My friend and I love the Notion UI, so we open-source a version we have been building.
- Block-based editor
- Drag to reorder blocks
- Basic Markdown-parsing including bold, italic, headings and divider
- Type &#x27;/&#x27; for command menu and shortcuts
Tiny fun detail: When you move between blocks with your arrow keys, your cursor will remain at roughly the same horizontal position (vs jumping to the start or end of a block).
Lotion is quite limited for now, and we would love any contributions (e.g. image blocks, video blocks, code blocks, etc.)

          <p>This month we launched a waitlist for Luro. For simplicity’s sake on our Eleventy-powered site, we felt like Netlify Forms was a slam dunk for getting the waitlist up and running in a couple minutes by adding a netlify attribute to our waitlist form.


	... form goes here ...



Netlify now intercepts these form requests, stores the results in a waitlist table, and lets us download them as a CSV. Huzzah.
CSVs are great and all, they power the business world, but we wanted to take it one step further and update a Notion database whenever someone uses the form. This gives us a lil’ impromptu CRM for adding metadata and tracking invite statuses internally when those start going out.
Sounds like a job for Zapier?
Yes! You can tota…</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/help-css-nesting/ target="_blank">Help pick a syntax for CSS nesting</a>
          <p>CSS nesting is a convenience syntax addition that allows CSS to be added inside
of a ruleset. If you&#x27;ve used
SCSS,
Less or
Stylus, then
you&#x27;ve most certainly seen a few flavors of this:
.nesting {
  color: hotpink;
  &gt; .is {
    color: rebeccapurple;
    &gt; .awesome {
      color: deeppink;
    }
  }
}
Which after being compiled to regular CSS by the preprocessor, turns into
regular CSS like this:
.nesting {
  color: hotpink;
}
.nesting &gt; .is {
  color: rebeccapurple;
}
.nesting &gt; .is &gt; .awesome {
  color: deeppink;
}
An official CSS version of this syntax is being strongly considered and we have
a split in preference that we&#x27;d like to employ the help of the community to
break the tie. The rest of this post will be introducing the syntax options so
you can feel informed to take a survey at …</p>

          <p>Y’know that situation where you tell the client, “Here’s your website and you can edit those four (4) little homepage features in the CMS” and the client says “Okay okay okay” and you check the site a week later and it looks bad because the client —despite your incredible documentation— put an odd number of items in the feature grid? It’s a major minor problem that’s tough to explain to the client, but it all comes down to…
The dangler.
Odd number grids are a sore point in Responsive Design. Even numbered grids collapse easily from 4 columns → 2 columns → 1 column, but odd numbered grids leave you with one extra column to figure out. You have two choices: drop the odd column to its own row or take the coward’s route and convert 3 columns → 1 column prematurely at ~800px. If you take that r…</p>

          <p>As a java backend developer decided to practice some front end work (Each backend developer dreams to become FrontEnd developer :-D )
I сhoosed Svelte+TailwindCSS to get more familiar with frameworks as I planning to use it on my next project(probably SvelteKit+TailwindCSS and SSR on Firebase function).
But to get started, decided to begin with something simple, pure Svelte+TailwindCSS and Firebase hosting.
And as my morning routine starts with some workout, decided to implement CrossFit timers.
This simple project allow me to understand more deeply:
  - work with components and cross-component communication 
  - work with local storage (custom store), so you can save yours timers to local storage
  - PWA capabilities, you can install it on your device and it can work in offline mode.
  - get familiar with utility classes and configuration of Tailwind
  - deploy it to Firebase hosting
Few words about product&#x27;s features: Four different timers available (Tabata, EMOM, AMRAP, RFT); possibility to save your timer; you can share your timers e.g. between your devices or with your friends or audience(for this purpose, custom URL parser/generator was implemented as Svelte doesn&#x27;t support routing unlike SvelteKit/Sapper); PWA and Offline mode.
Conclusion/Impression: 
It&#x27;s pleasure to work with Svelte, it allows you write well structured code, all concepts are understandable and easy to apply, pre built animations and transition, flexibility
With TailwindCSS you can quickly prototype UI components with any complexity with 99% of cases, otherwise extensions are available.
Firebase allowed me to deploy the app in few clicks and, as it just hosting, free quotes are available.

          <p>Dave Rupert recently published a post expressing his frustration with the urgent case for action on climate change, and lack of co-ordinated policy action by the people in power. While much of the world suffers from extreme high temperures this summer, climate change has become a visible, tangible issue for many of us.
Dave rightly points out that the environmental responsibility has been unfairly hoisted onto the consumer, when in reality this is by the design of governments and large corporations, who have vested interests in maintaining the status quo. Individual lifestyle changes, such as reusable shopping bags, sorting our recycling, or going vegan are never going to make much of a difference when faced with the unstoppable juggernaut of capitalism.

          <p>This is a distinct skill. Something can be dependable without being extraordinary, rare or even a good value. It’s also one of the easiest skills to acquire, and often quite valuable if you stick with it. While sticking with dependable is sort of redundant, it’s also required.</p>

          <p>This summer has been hot. Not the hottest summer I’ve had in Texas but hot enough. More worryingly, it’s another summer in what looks like a trend of increasingly hot summers due to unstoppable climate change. It’s hot enough that the grass is dying in places that don’t have shade. The heat is so exhausting we’re making trips to cooler states in the summer to escape, ironically those trips are on planes, which exacerbates the climate problem.
I’m desperate to figure out a way I can help. I keep researching what ascetic life changes I could make to have the biggest impact. I could go vegan tomorrow if it made a big difference… but… and I hate to be a cynic… but one dude in Texas changing his diet isn’t going to save the Earth. It wouldn’t even move the needle.
My biggest point of frustratio…</p>

          <p>Hey HN,
First time submitter here.
After a FOSS related interaction required me to use Google Forms 9 months, I wondered on why no such FOSS tool existed and decided to build it myself. I aimed the site to be for people like me, so no telemetry and minimal JS was the goal. I know this is rather small and incomplete compared to other projects but I&#x27;ve thought you folk might be interested.
Not sure if it breaks the pure part, but the site also uses Flask.
If you&#x27;re lucky, you might find the app alive at: https://formie.div72.xyz.

Move aside, Pacman; there’s a new pixel in town. The pixel art in this collection is nothing short of masterful. Who knew such beauty could come from these “picture elements” of programmable color. What was once reserved for 8-bit video games like Zelda and Mario Bros has evolved into NFTs worth millions of dollars.
Crypto Punks, beware. These pixels are out of this world! ■

This week is full of awesome CSS stuff that people have dreamt of only some years ago. And we have other articles that I’ve been long waiting for: Great custom maps, a modern end-to-end testing framework and a fast Electron alternative. But first of all, the topic of the week:
People always talk about quality time for work, family, fitness, self-care, or sports… but what about having leisure time that allows you to think about nothing and let your mind pause for a bit?
UI/UX
When we talk about User Experience design we often think about design, a clean UI or similar things. But a lot of the experience has to do with the words and texts chosen for the project and here’s a guide that helps understanding the importance of UX Writing.

          <p>I started as a side project, and after 6 months of development, I feel my baby is ready for some beta users. Coming from an engineering background, I had no experience in marketing. I am not looking for a large number of users, only maybe 100 for testing and feedback purposes.
I started with the idea of managing all contents and tools better (into a single contextual workspace).

          <p>It looks like Google has rolled out a very anti-user update to Analytics.
We have a report on traffic by URL broken out by query string that we use weekly. Right now that report is unusable, and if I try and query I can only query by page title, not URL and definitely not query string.
Is there a way to revert this update, or tell Google &quot;I know what a URL is, please stop this.&quot;

          <p>✏️ This article was written by Nate Holmes and sponsored by our friends at Widen, an Acquia company
A lot goes into creative work. Sure, there’s the actual time a designer spends designing. But there’s also time spent concepting, aligning with business goals, gaining approval, and so much more. If the output ends up being a single-use design, it means you’re likely not getting as much out of your efforts as you could be.
Using creative work in multiple ways accelerates workflows by giving teams access to approved, high-quality content. 
Finding ways to make your design work available for other teams to use, reuse, and repurpose creates endless opportunities to get more value from your creative investment. Using creative work in multiple ways reduces time spent on overlapping efforts, frees…</p>

          <p>Chrome DevTools is adding support for top layer elements, making it easier for developers to debug their code that makes use of top layer elements.
Note: This is a preview feature available in Chrome Canary from version 105.
This article describes what top layer elements are, how DevTools help to visualize the top layer content to understand and debug DOM structure that contains top layer elements, and how DevTools top layer support is implemented.
# What are the top layer and top layer elements?
What exactly happens internally when you open a  as a modal? 🤔
It is put into a top layer. Top layer content renders on top of all other content. For example, a modal dialog needs to appear on top of all other DOM content, so the browser automatically renders this element in a &#x27;top layer&#x27;…</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;32153868 target="_blank">Ask HN: How to “compile” HTML+CSS for minimal page size?</a>
          <p>From the perspective of static site generation, is there a tool to compile HTML+CSS in order to minimize download size?
I&#x27;m imagining something which takes the following HTML+CSS:
    
    h1{color:red;}
    h2{color:blue;}
    .custom{display:none;}
    .custom2{display:inline;}
    
    ...
    
Hello
lorem ipsum
dolor sit amet

And transforms it into this:
    
Hello
lorem ipsum
dolor sit amet

However, it should not always inline the css styles, because sometimes that would cause the result to be larger than the original, like this:
    
    h1{color:red;}
    h2{color:blue;}
    .custom{display:none;}
    .custom2{display:inline;background-color:yellow;}
    
    ...
    
Hello
lorem ipsum
dolor sit amet

Here, 
 is shorter than 
, so it should remain unchanged.
I&#x27;m not talking about tools like https://htmlcompressor.com/compressor/ which only remove whitespace, or gzip compression. What I want is something that understands the semantics of HTML+CSS and can intelligently inline iff that reduces the size of the resulting HTML file.

          <a href=https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2022/07/19/bootstrap-5-2-0/ target="_blank">Bootstrap 5.2.0</a>
          <p>Bootstrap v5.2.0 is finally stable! We’ve ironed out more bugs, improved more documentation, written new guides and built out new functional environment examples, and so much more!
Keep reading for highlights from both beta and stable releases.
Docs redesign
As previewed in our beta release, the docs have been redesigned! It starts with our new homepage  where we have a more complete representation of Bootstrap’s features and an updated design.


The docs sidebar navigation has been overhauled to have always expanded groups for easier browsing, a brand new DocSearch experience with search history, and new responsive offcanvas drawers for both sidebar and navbar on mobile.




We even updated our version picker in the navbar to cross-link between minor releases!


Updated buttons and inputs…</p>

          <a href=https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2022/07/19/bootstrap-4-6-2/ target="_blank">Bootstrap v4.6.2</a>
          <p>After several months, we’ve finally shipped Bootstrap v4.6.2, one of our last releases for the v4. It’s a bit of a maintenance patch featuring bug fixes, dependency updates, and some docs updates.
Read on for the highlights or head to the v4.6.x docs to see the latest in action.
What’s changed
There are two big highlights in v4.6.2:
First, we’ve added an example to our Collapse plugin docs to show how to use horizontal collapsing. This has long been possible via our JS, but we never had an official class to utilize it.
Second, we’ve replaced the deprecated color-adjust with print-color-adjust in our Sass files as part of the Autoprefixer v10.4.6 issues. This should quiet the issues folks have seen from that dependency change. If you’re using our distribution CSS files, like bootstrap.min.css, you may still see the warning.
Beyond that, we’ve addressed a few other things:
Tweaked the size of small and .small to compute to a whole pixel value (was 12.8px and now is 14px).
Improved accessibility around our dropdowns, color contrast, and role attributes.
Fixed some broken links to supporting documentation.
Updated dependencies across the board.
Review the GitHub v4.6.2 release changelog for more details.
From here, we don’t expect to ship any meaningful updates to v4.6.x other than major security or dependency updates. Everything will focus on v5 and beyond after this release, starting with the stable release of v5.2.0. Bootstrap 4 will officially end of life January 1, 2023, though you’re obviously welcome to continue using it longer than that. Follow our release repo to stay in the loop on release maintenance status.

      <p>CSS In Real Life</p>

          <a href=https://css-irl.info/logical-properties-for-useful-shorthands/ target="_blank">Logical Properties for Useful Shorthands</a>
          <p>Something I like about logical properties is the ability to set margins or padding on just a single axis on an element, while leaving the other alone. Say we have an element on which we’ve set some padding using the padding shorthand:
/* This gives us 1rem padding all the way around */
.box {
  padding: 1rem;
}
If, later on, we want to adjust the padding only on the x-axis (while preserving our original value on the y-axis), we have a couple of choices:
We could use padding-left and padding-right. Fine, but longer than our original shorthand.
.box--some-variant {
  padding-right: 2rem;
  padding-left: 2rem;
}
We could use the shorthand, but remembering to include our original values.
.box--some-variant {
  padding: 1rem 2rem;
}
I’m not a huge fan of having to repeat the original value for the y-axis padding. We could abstract those values out into custom properties — something like this:
.box {
  padding: var(--py, 1rem) var(--px, 1rem);
}
.box--some-variant {
  --px: 2rem;
}
On the other hand, there is a logical property that enables us to adjust the padding on a single axis: padding-inline refers to the padding on the x-axis when the document is in the left-to-right (default) or right-to-left writing mode. padding-block refers to the y-axis. (Those directions are reversed for a vertical writing mode.)
So instead we could write:
.box {
  padding: 1rem;
}
.box--some-variant {
  padding-inline: 2rem;
}
Codepen demo →
The same applies to margins, borders and a bunch of others. And check out the inset property for a great positioning shorthand!
Logical properties are very well supported in browsers now, so it’s a good time to start using them.</p>

          <p>Open source software plays an integral part of how developers build for the web. Over the last few years, the Chrome Web Frameworks and Tools Performance fund has tried to help support this effort through the sponsorship of popular JavaScript frameworks and developer tools. This is in addition to our engineering collaborations on projects like React, Next.js and Angular through Project Aurora.
Today we are happy to share that we will be distributing another $500K through Open Collective to projects focused on improving the performance, user-experience and developer-experience building for the web over the next year. These projects include:

          <p>Hey there, I am Honey - Co-founder at Locofy.
We, along with other makers, have been building Locofy.ai to help massively accelerate the builders - the designers, developers, product managers &amp; founders, and we&#x27;re excited to share it today with the HN Community.
Locofy.ai simply converts designs into production-ready frontend code for web and mobile apps. It adapts to your preferred design tools, tech stack, and workflows with ease and lets you launch upto 4x faster, while letting designers design the way they want and giving high-quality responsive code that developers love.
With this launch, you can convert your Figma designs into React, React Native, Next.js, Gatsby, and HTML-CSS code. You get a live-responsive prototype that runs on code (we call these ‘real-fidelity prototypes’) and when good to go, you can either export the code to build on top of it or directly deploy to Netlify, Vercel, or Github.
Today, we have also launched on Product Hunt. Let us know your thoughts and suggestions: https://www.producthunt.com/posts/locofy-ai.
Our team will be answering all your questions!

      My name is Serina Murphy and I’m currently a UI/UX Designer at Fear Free.



Tell us about your background and experience with design.
After spending a decade of proven success driving revenue in tech advertising (Yahoo!, Miniclip, Disney), I sought out a new career that leverages my creativity and experience in tech. I married two distinct areas of my educational background in occupational therapy (earning a Master’s degree) and UX design (completing a design bootcamp at Avocademy).

          <p>For those working in tech/software development teams - do you also find that there&#x27;s a lot of tension between developers and designers?
They need to work together but it always seems like a challenge. From the tools they prefer (Figma vs. Github) to the pace/workflow to the language and communication.
What are the biggest pain points you&#x27;ve seen?
What are some great tips for bridging the gaps during a typical workflow?
Thanks!

          <p>Hypothetically, consider a social photo platform - each pic gets its own url, this page contains the image, text about the image, buttons for the user to click, related pics, and some user-specific elements (maybe notifications, etc.).
There are different ways of going about the frontend. In each case, elements specific to the logged-in-user and the related images get fetched via api calls and are rendered client side.
For rendering the rest of the page -
1. Everything is rendered client side - one can use a single page application to handle the routing. The page structure stays the same, and new image uri&#x27;s and the associated content are fetched via api calls.
SEO is a priority, so pure client side rendering is suboptimal.

          <p>I tried to run the old standalone version of SketchUp Make 2017 on my modern M1 Mac running macOS Monterey 12.4 recently. At first it went pretty badly, crashing on startup with the error “SketchUp quit unexpectedly.”

But I got it working!
Here’s how to get it running by removing the code signature.
The main clue came when I tried running it from the Terminal, to see if it
would show a more useful error. I got the same popup error, but also this:
rosetta error: /var/db/blahblah/SketchUp.aot: attachment of code signature supplement failed: 1
zsh: trace trap  /Applications/SketchUp\ 2017/SketchUp.app/Contents/MacOS/SketchUp

“attachment of code signature supplement failed”, eh?
We’ll just remove that code signature, then… from absolutely everything inside the app.
To do this, launch the Ter…</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/devtools-tips-10/ target="_blank">DevTools Tips: How to emulate CSS user preference media features with DevTools</a>
          <p>User preference media features give you the ability to style web experiences that align with the user&#x27;s own specific preferences and needs. In other words, preference media features allow you to adapt your user experiences to your user&#x27;s expectations.


You can enhance the user experience of your website by taking the following three steps:
Discover the possibilities. Learn all the user preference media features.
Style your web experiences. Implement, for example, color, layout, and element size changes based on the preferences.
Test the UI. In DevTools, emulate the preferences and test how your website behaves.
DevTools supports a variety of emulation options. To help you avoid searching for and adjusting system and browser settings, all the emulation options reside in one place—under the Rendering tab in DevTools.
The emulation options of the user&#x27;s preferences include but are not limited to:
prefers-color scheme—light or dark color scheme
prefers-contrast—lower or higher contrast
prefers-reduced-motion—minimize motion or not
prefers-reduced-data—consume less traffic or not
For a comprehensive list of all emulation options, see Emulate CSS media features.
To discover more effects you can apply using the Rendering tab, see the Rendering tab overview.
Additionally, with DevTools, your testing capabilities aren&#x27;t limited to the single device you&#x27;re working on. You can Simulate mobile devices with Device Mode.</p>

          <p>Bootstrap Icons v1.9.0 is here with over 140 new and updated icons, including some longstanding requests for new brands, transportation options, numbers and letters, and so much more. With this release, we’re now at over 1,800 icons!
140+ new icons
Here’s a quick look at all the new icons in v1.9.0:



Tons of new brand icons including popular browsers, Ubuntu, Google Play, Android, Dropbox, and many more.
New transportation icons including cars, trains, planes, fuel, and common road signs.
New number and letter icons for 1-9, R, C, CC, H, and P (for use cases like registered trademark, copyright, Creative Commons, hospital or helicopter, and parking).
New medical icons for prescriptions, pills, and viruses.
New keyboard icons for tab and escape.
New Universal Access cions.
Redrawn cup icon, now with a steam variant for hot beverages.
Fire, finally!
There are a handful more in there as well, so have a look and put them to use in your next update! In addition, we’ve updated our docs to include mention of Composer installs.
Looking for more new icons? Head to the issue tracker to check for open requests or submit a new one.
Install
To get started, install or update via npm:
npm i bootstrap-icons


Or Composer:
composer require twbs/bootstrap-icons


You can also download the release from GitHub, or download just the SVGs and fonts (without the rest of the repository files).
Figma
The Figma file is now published to the Figma Community! It’s the same Bootstrap Icons Figma file you’ve seen from previous releases, just a little more accessible to those using the app.</p>

# Restart frame during debugging
The Restart frame feature is back! You can re-run the preceding code when paused somewhere in a function. Previously, this feature was deprecated and removed in Chrome 92 due to stability issues.
In this example, the debugger initially paused at the breakpoint (line 343) near the end of the toggleColorScheme function. To restart the debugging from the beginning of the toggleColorScheme function, expand the Call stack section in the Debugger pane, right click on toggleColorScheme and select Restart frame.
