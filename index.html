We’re used to using the DOMContentLoaded event (commonly referred to as “domready”) but did you know there’s an event that tells you when all fonts have loaded? Let’s learn how to use document.fonts! The document.fonts object features a ready property which […]

          <p>I&#x27;ve came to deep realization that CSS is the most important  thing for building a website. It holds the key to becoming full stack developer or just a backend developer. It&#x27;s everything in frontend.
Sooner or later, you&#x27;ll need vanilla css. You can&#x27;t depend on bootcrap or failwindcss. Your site looks like same if you do so. And many components aren&#x27;t available there.
There are components like carousel, cards hover etc etc..How to polish all these skills?
Is there a course for it?
I try to practice it like randomly, but there are no tutorials. I&#x27;m not at a phase where I can read complex long code and  decode it.

          <p>Firstly, I wish everyone a merry Christmas.
If you log onto Hacker News everyday, you&#x27;ll notice that a lot of changes have happened in the website.
For starters: the navigation bar&#x27;s color has changed to a slightly darker shade of red, rather than the orange background.
The top post numbers are now in alternating red and green colors (christmas colors).
I couldn&#x27;t have been the only one to notice, right? In the beginning I thought something was messed up - only to realize what day it was today.

          <a href=https://daverupert.com/2022/12/megan-smith-general-magic-prototypes/ target="_blank">Megan Smith explaining the General Magic prototyping process</a>
          <p>I watched the documentary General Magic (mentioned in Tony Fadell’s book Build) about the 1990s Apple spin-off company General Magic that built the iPhone before the iPhone. Ultimately the product was a commercial failure, but the documentary is a wonderful look at product design and what happens when you let talented engineers roam free range. They invented USB, created capacitive touch screen GUIs, and imagined the portable “Post-PC” world before Windows 95 and the Internet were ever popular. Ultimately the product was a failure, too early for its time. How did they build this product? Well the answer is… prototypes.
My favorite part of the documentary is Megan Smith beaming over her cabinet full of hardware prototypes. Her focus on making something people love, an intimate device, is infectious. Her eagerness to blend everyone’s wishes with the harsh reality of available and affordable hardware shows. Starting with off-the-shelf components and inventing if necessary. When describing the product, she’s not talking about megabytes, protocols, and pixels, but talking about the sound, the feeling, the touch of the product and software in people’s hands.
I feel more vindicated than ever that prototypes, put in people’s hands, are the biggest opportunity to capture lightning in a bottle. These people are imagining and building the iPhone 17 years before the iPhone launched. Megan Smith talks like Steve Jobs, but Steve Jobs doesn’t work at Apple or General Magic. We often herald the invention of the iPhone or Android and these magic devices as invented out of thin air or our collective science fiction, but both of those products used by billions of people rose from the ashes of General Magic’s failure. That’s a lot to dwell on. The composting of failures produces rich and fertile soil.</p>

          <p>School and work push us to avoid real dreams. Dreamers are dangerous, impatient and unwilling to tolerate the status quo. Existing systems would prefer we simply fit in. The dreams we need to teach are the dreams of self-reliance and generosity. The only way for us to move forward is to encourage and amplify the […]</p>

          <p>By now, I&#x27;m done with basics html,css,bootstrap coding. I can build navbar, build a hero section with image and h1 text and a footer. That&#x27;s all.
There are various components in a website though. I&#x27;d like to be able to build any of them whenever required if I&#x27;m in a job.
I wanted to build a timeline using html and css but it&#x27;s not entering my head at all. I&#x27;ve seen codes from multiple websites.
https://imgur.com/a/L7c1Bkj
This is the timeline that I want to build. Looks pretty simple but I&#x27;m unable to build it. How do I deal with stuffs like this? How do I learn these stuffs?
Is there a course that helps to deal with these stuffs? There&#x27;s no point of having learn CSS if I can&#x27;t build these stuffs with my visualization. Please guide me.
The scary thing here is that if I can&#x27;t build these stuffs then there is 0 point of me learning css. And I&#x27;m not going to get any full stack or frontend jobs like that way.

          <p>It’s a Christmas miracle—Bootstrap v5.3.0-alpha1 has arrived just in time for the holiday break! This release brings new color mode support, an expanded color palette with variables and utilities, and more.
We’re keeping things short and simple in this blog post with deeper dives into the new color modes and more coming in future posts. For now, we want you to enjoy the holiday break and come back next year feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. Keep reading for what’s new and we’ll see you next year!
Dark mode and color modes


Bootstrap now supports an explicit opt-in for creating multiple color modes via the data-bs-theme attribute on the root

          <p>MailChimp used to send out a client&#x27;s newsletters from RSS feed without issue. A few weeks ago, they started showing up a day later. After weeks of trying to get support to track down this bug, we finally got this response
&quot;Thank you for your patience while my team looks at this. We were able to confirm that the best time range currently to space the blog posts is 10-12 hours before Mailchimp&#x27;s sending time. There just isn&#x27;t enough time between your posts and the feed to pull the new content.
As a best practice, I would plan your content releases a day in advance with this functionality in mind.&quot;
It started with 4 hours, now they are telling us 10-12 hours in advance? My client runs a news site and sends our daily news. It&#x27;s not always possible to even publish content that far in advance. It&#x27;s insane to me that this functionality was working fine, for years. That they have managed to break and instead of fixing are saying just publish an insane amount of time ahead of the newsletter being sent?
I&#x27;m not sure what it takes to get someone&#x27;s attention at MailChimp to actually fix this. Read the RSS feed before sending the scheduled post. Like it used to. Otherwise, what newsletter providers would people recommend replacing MailChimp with?

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/early-stable/ target="_blank">Change in release schedule from Chrome 110</a>
          <p>We are making a change to the release schedule for Chrome. From Chrome 110, the initial release date to stable will be one week earlier. This early stable version will be released to a small percentage of users, with the majority of people getting the release a week later at the normal scheduled date, this will also be the date the new version is available from the Chrome download page.
For Chrome 110 the key dates will be:
Beta: January 12, 2023
Early Stable: February 1, 2023
Stable: February 7, 2023
You can keep track of upcoming release dates and included features on the Chrome Status Roadmap, and on the Chromium Dashboard. The beta posts have more details of features, and any deprecations and removals for each release.
# Why are we making this change?
By releasing stable to a small percentage of users early, we get a chance to monitor the release before it rolls out to all of our users. If any showstopping issue is discovered, it can be addressed while the impact is relatively small.
For most developers this change will have little impact. Keep following this blog for up to date information on features and any upcoming deprecations and removals. We aim to bring you any relevant information in good time for you to act upon it, before any change in Chrome.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34037748 target="_blank">Ask HN: How can I design a generic library that provides its own endpoints?</a>
          <p>I like how ActivityPub can be implemented on any website and provide a good set of endpoints to enable rich, social-media-like content interactions. I&#x27;d love to enable my current website to respond to those requests, but I don&#x27;t want to either use &quot;activitypub-express&quot; or install a full Mastodon (or any other) server just for myself.
My idea was to implement the protocol myself, which would be a nice way to learn it and its problems. But I would also love to make it a library that can be applied by others on their own, already existing websites.
The problem that I am having is that the current methods to implement this kind of pluggable extension involve connecting to one specific back end framework, such as creating an Express middleware.
What I was thinking was:
- Use TypeScript (to leverage the large JS community)
- Make it as vanilla as possible
- Use fetch standards such as the Request and Response objects, which are available natively since Node 18
- Provide multiple adapters for common frameworks such as Express, Fastify, Next.js, Astro, etc
Is this solved elegantly on any other language or framework?

I’m adding a micro blog for shorter posts / to have a central controlled place for my short term content while Twitter meltdowns and everybody sorts out what’s coming next in that space.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;34014642 target="_blank">Ask HN: What is the successor to HTML Applications (.hta)?</a>
          <p>Back in the day (late 90s), Microsoft had a format called &quot;HTML Application.&quot;
It was just an HTML page with a &quot;.hta&quot; file extension. Opening such a file would open it in a chrome-less browser, and give the scripting in the page access to the file system.
I used to love these things. I wrote a bunch of little apps in them.
Some examples:
https://medium.com/@anht_59851/html-application-hta-a-gui-for-your-scripting-on-windows-bfaacf2c3bdd
These still exist, but there are problems with them:
1. Coding is a bear. They run in the mshta.exe process, and that spawns an instance of... IE9, I think? There&#x27;s no &quot;inspect&quot; panel, for instance, and errors just pop a modal with no debugging information.
2. Near as I can tell, they use an older version of ECMAScript. &quot;let&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to work, not does &quot;addEventListener,&quot; etc. I kept getting weird &quot;Syntax Errors&quot; for things that appeared to be valid, contemporary JavaScript.
3. I&#x27;m quite sure some security software (like on my laptop, issued by employer), blocks these from executing.
What&#x27;s the current-day equivalent of these?  I want to write an HTML page complete with CSS and JS, double-click on it from my desktop, have it open in a browser instance of its own, and have access to the file system.
I essentially want a way to create little GUI apps, without having to use WinForms.
What am I looking for? Is it Electron?
(Note: I&#x27;m on Windows)

          <p>After we ran the previous survey to help choose the syntax for CSS Nesting, the CSS Working Group continued debate over the best way to define nesting in CSS. During the discussions new syntax ideas were suggested. To help the Working Group choose between any of these syntaxes, there is a new survey.
# The Options
Based on the results of the previous survey, options one and two are no longer being considered. Two new options (four and five) have been added.
# Option 5: Top-level nesting container
Introduces a top-level @nest rule that contains a &amp; { … } block with declarations and multiple nested style rules.
@nest selector {
  &amp; {
    property: value;
  }
  nested-selector {
    property: value;
  }
}
# Option 4: Postfix proposal
An extra code block containing the nested rules is inserted after main rule which contains the declarations.
selector {
  property: value;
} {
  nested-selector {
    property: value;
  }
}
# Option 3: Non-letter start proposal
Every nested rule to be unambiguous on its own, by requiring it to start with a non-symbol. You can write &amp; div or :is(div) if you need to start a selector with a type selector.
selector {
  property: value;
  &amp; nested-selector {
    property: value;
  }
}
While the snippets above are only used to demonstrate the basics of each proposal, there are many more examples included along with the new survey.

          <p>I made a chrome extension to extract styles from elements on a webpage. Its surprisingly hard to do without access to chrome debugger API in manifest V3. It doesn&#x27;t work for every site and I’m still improving it. A particular sore spot is with media queries but I&#x27;m working on a solution.
Any feedback is appreciated.

          <p>Confession: I almost never write border-radius as shorthand, largely because I can never remember the order. My brain is wired to remember margin and padding shorthands (top, right, bottom, left), but when it comes to corners it’s a different story. Do I start from the top left corner, or the top right? So I usually resort to the longhand, which is admittedly verbose, but at least has the advantage of being explicit, for me and any future readers of my code. For the record, these are equivalent:
div {
  border-radius: 10% 20% 30% 75%;
}
div {
  border-top-left-radius: 10%;
  border-top-right-radius: 20%;
  border-bottom-right-radius: 30%;
  border-bottom-left-radius: 75%;
}
In the shorthand, we start from the top left corner, and go round clockwise, ending with the bottom left.

          <p>We are announcing a set of policy updates designed to encourage the development
of high quality products, prevent deceptive behavior, and ensure informed user
consent. These updates include:
Minimum Functionality Policy Update
—Expands our current Minimum Functionality Policy to include
click-baity template extensions, empty extensions, and extensions that do not
directly provide their stated functionality.
Misleading and Deceptive Behavior Policy Update
—Prohibits anti-virus, privacy, and security extensions that provide no
discernible protection or monitoring.
Affiliate Ads Policy
—Establishes new disclosure requirements for extensions that include
affiliate ad programs. Developers will now be required to disclose any
affiliate programs to users before installation. Additionally, related user
action is required before the inclusion of affiliate codes, links, or
cookies.
Developers can also learn more about today&#x27;s guidance in our Program Policies.
These policy clarifications will go into effect on January 15, 2023. After that
date, extensions in violation of these new policies may be removed from the
Chrome Web Store and be disabled.
If you have any questions, you can contact developer support.
Thank you for your cooperation, and for your participation in the Chrome
extension ecosystem!

          <p>As a designer, your brand is more than your awwward winning website and the final_final_v2 assets you deliver to your client.
It’s the entire client journey from start to finish.
Unfortunately, designers are forced to use tools that are dated, clunky, and give clients an experience far from “designer”.
The good news is that there are tools you might not know about that can fix this. See for example this free invoice generator that was created for creatives.
To build a brand that enables you to raise your rates, you have to connect every client touch-point in an experience that is beautiful and intuitive.
To do this, every designer must decide if they will use individual tools or an all-in-one platform like Bloom. While individual tools will give you more features, they are far more expensi…</p>

          <p>WebPageTest has supported Google&#x27;s Lighthouse as part of our test suite for a while now, and there are a number of great reasons to choose to run Lighthouse on WebPageTest (accurate packet-level throttling, clean test environment with careful configuration to ensure accuracy and repeatability, always the latest version, etc. etc.)
That said, we&#x27;ve long felt that there were opportunities to make better use of Lighthouse results alongside WebPageTest&#x27;s broader test analysis. Today, we took the first steps towards that goal with a new Lighthouse result page that has a number of unique features we think you&#x27;ll find very useful.
A New Lighthouse Result Page
As of today, WebPageTest&#x27;s Lighthouse results will now be displayed like other first-party test result pages on WebPageTest:

          <p>It was always “Oh, you’re only at risk of automation if your job has a high degree of repetition, creative jobs are less at risk” but it feels like over the course of the past year Copilot, Dall-e, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and ChatGPT have decided upend that assumption. Writing, code, art… all with computers nipping at the heels with competency and speed. Fascinating. Unexpected in my lifetime. A mild bit alarming, but fascinating nonetheless.
I don’t think it’s all bad, but my brain is still ramping up to the new reality that these handicrafts have (likely) been permanently altered. We should celebrate the lower bar for creative endeavors; you no longer need to be an expert at Photoshop to produce a creative image, just an expert at generating prompts. People are extracting beautiful artifacts from these machines. Incredible.
As interesting a future this creates, I’m a member of an old caste of people that still believes massive gains don’t come without realized costs; or more explicitly, electricity isn’t the only cost. What if the cost we’re paying is our perception of reality itself? It’s increasingly likely that the next thing you read or watch is the product of a content extruder. Your favorite author, artist, creator, influencer, job applicant, or manager; the curtain pulled back to reveal a series of six word prompts. Rather than be left behind, I should start the augmentation process now…

          <p>Wanted to check out Golang so built a simple local RSS Digest reader, using any markdown reader as its GUI. I&#x27;ve been using it for the last 4 months and I am quite content with it, especially since my markdown files are synced on all devices, I can consume my daily brew from anywhere and anytime without any FOMO.
Features:
- RSS Digest: show only previously un-generated articles
- Interested Topics/Keywords (through Google News)
- Daily Weather
- Bookmark to Instapaper
- Show hot articles / comments link for Hacker News posts
Upcoming Features:
- Terminal mode
- Quote of the day (from r/quotes)
- Perhaps a daily calendar, to show today&#x27;s meeting 
- Accessing non-rss feeds (Twitter)
- Configurable for Weekly digest instead of Daily
Any feedback/idea is welcome :)

          <p>When AI is smart enough to write an essay, then what happens? GPT3 is back in the news, because, as expected, it’s getting better and better.

Something like this:
    Comment by Blah:
    The best is to use a template literal.
    
        Reply by Foo:
        I disagree, you should use str.replace and ignore
        template literals.
    
            Reply by Blah:
            Respectfully, you are an idiot. Ignoring template literals
            for a horrible regex has no place in JavaScript.
    
        Reply by wattle:
        I agree, and here&#x27;s a tangent that doesn&#x27;t have
        much to do with the topic.

Is it possible to style HN like that?

          <p>I&#x27;ve tried searching for this but the confluence of search terms required results in a lot of off-topic results.
Basically let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m using Tailwind with React, and I frequently use the pattern:

Is there any tool out there that will analyze a project&#x27;s source and look for these patterns, and suggestions for creation of components out of them? I could have sworn I saw this as a VSCode Extension or something at one point.

          <p>I just want to focus on content. I want a minimal, fast, legible page that is built from Markdown.
I’ve tried four or five times now. Dozens of hours wasted learning frameworks and testing out themes and designs.
I don’t have thousands of dollars for a designer to come save me. So I’m feeling frustrated and lost at how to get something that’s serviceable so I can move on to the content.
Every blog I see linked on this website seems so nice in comparison!
For reference, my current attempt. I hate it. https://todays.pointless.click/

          <p>Chrome 108 introduced two new modes, Memory Saver and Energy Saver, to give users more control over how Chrome utilizes their system resources.
While these new modes are primarily user-facing, they do have some implications that are important for web developers to be aware of, as they can potentially impact the user experience of your site.
This post will cover the potential effects of these new modes and what web developers can do to ensure they&#x27;re delivering the best experience possible.
# Memory Saver mode
When Memory Saver mode is enabled, Chrome will proactively discard tabs that have been unused in the background for some time. This frees up memory for active tabs as well as other applications that may be running. Users can instruct Chrome not to discard tabs for specific sites; howe…</p>

          <p>Hi HN,
During this year we have been building Depoxy, a tool for managing and optimizing data pipelines on AWS.
The main reasons for building Depoxy are:
the current UIs for managing data pipelines are inefficient
optimizing data pipelines has a lot of potential both in CO2 and financial terms
Where is this inefficiency coming from and how much better we can get?
The UI and the tooling around data services are not integrated at the level it is optimal. This is the reason why having an integrated UI improves the workflows by 50% (22s vs 54s). You can check out the video we have about a simple workflow.
How much optimization?
We have 10 years experience with various clients in this space and based on the previous experiences the optimization potential is between 10 - 30% year over year infrastructure cost. This is a lot for many companies, especially nowadays.
Where are we with this product?
This is the first iteration of the product and we just got started. The next iteration is going to be metadata analytics engine for data that is stored on AWS S3. Based on the metadata we can get insight into the efficiency of the data set and provide guidance for optimizing it.
The second next iteration we are planning to implement a SQL parsing engine that provides automatic data lineage so that people can track how data flows through their system.
Detailed blog post with a lot more:

Let us know what you think. If you find any problems, issues (even security bugs) please let us know. Thank you in advance.

          <p>I am so impressed with how far we have come with HTML and CSS over the years.  But printing still leaves orphaned headers at the bottom of pages and splits paragraphs so that 1% of my paragraph is on a page by itself.
 and 
 are the bread and butter of semantic text on the web.  Is there still no way of heuristically placing them on the printed page, in a way that looks typographically reasonable?

          <p>Hey,
Will you recognize what the icons in the following link want to explain? I thought it’s a good quiz to ask my international friends here to find out how well these icons work. Now think about using only icons for an interface again. The idea of building these icons is to reduce friction in the user interface and to clean up endless text options but what is it worth if no one knows what the symbol really means?

As the world increasingly becomes more connected, companies look for ways to tap into new markets and expand their customer base. One way they’re doing this is by becoming more diverse in their workforce. There are many benefits to having a workforce representing different cultures and backgrounds. It can also lead to more creativity and innovative thinking, as employees with different perspectives can bring new ideas to the table.
Remote work has become more prevalent in recent years, allowing employees to work from anywhere in the world. This gives companies access to a larger …</p>

          <p>Hi all
I remember finding (and subsequently losing the link to) a website a few months ago which outlined a process for requirements gathering and description based around an initiating event and the data transformations that should take place in response to it. All google searches I can think of lead to many articles about event driven software patterns. Hoping someone here knows what I&#x27;m referring to!

          <p>I&#x27;ve found a few communities with great art and mockups, but they seldom have people discussing the code parts of design and those conversations are what I&#x27;m looking for.
I&#x27;d imagine that there&#x27;s a lot more overlap between developers and artists, I just need to find where that&#x27;s happening. Does something exist that&#x27;s like a cross between HN and Dribbble?

We went to my Mom’s in Houston for Thanksgiving this year. The weather was rainy and the kids went a bit stir crazy but we had a good time. We also had a small Friendsgiving the Sunday before; it’s a great feeling to have a house full of kids and friends around the kitchen island spinning stories. I’m thankful for my friends and family.
I resurfaced my interest in Qawwali music this month enjoying Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and the Nooran Sisters. I love it. The mix of storytelling and improv which has the potential to produce something like this…

Indistinguishable from a Fleet Foxes song if you ask me. Sitting on the floor with your buds, harmonium and tablas, singing and echoing phrases, and people throwing money at you; seems like a sustainable music business model…</p>

          <p>With DevTools, you can test how your website behaves and performs on any device without having to browse it on real devices.


Use the Device Mode to simulate a mobile viewport and configure it:
Set the device dimensions in various ways or use the presets.
Switch between landscape and portrait orientations.
Debug the @media min- and max-width breakpoints.
Choose a device to simulate or configure a custom one.
Simulate your page&#x27;s performance on mid-tier and low-end devices by throttling CPU and network speed.
Enable offline mode to test your website&#x27;s offline content, if any.

It turned out rather long &amp; detailed (shouldn&#x27;t have used those 4k, trending on artstation modifiers I guess), and it includes some (I think) pretty good ideas on optimizations (xFormers for the win), sharing on Gradio (never forget --gradio-auth), and GPUs in general (V100 is ).

          <p>I built a habit tracker https://flathabits.com to scratch an itch. I really wanted to do the right thing for the users. The driving principles were as follows:
- Privacy. These are your personal habits (and they stay on your phone). I want zero access to your data.
- Minimal friction. Habit tracking requires dedication, so it should require almost no effort to stay on top of it.
- No gimmicks. Really, no games, prizes, etc. Just want to build an effective tool.
- No lock-in. Your data is yours. It is saved locally to a text file you can inspect or export at any time.
- No sign-up or account. There really is no need for it. Period.
- No social. Social really just gets in the way. These are your habits, focus on them.
- No analytics. None of any kind. If you like the app or there&#x27;s a bug, just report it.
- Text-based. Not that it matters to many users, but all data is stored to a text file in org mode.
I&#x27;ve used the app thoroghly and managed to rack up a decent year and a half of continuous running and meditation amongst other habits. The app has 114 ratings (across all countries) with a 4.8 score. But, the app hasn&#x27;re really picked up many users (1-5 daily downloads) even as a free app.
So, what is this habit tracker missing? What do you actually want in a habit tracker?

          <p>I have over twenty years of software engineering experience and I&#x27;ve seen countless examples of architecture documents but I rarely see a high level design document that really stands out. I&#x27;m also surprised that there isn&#x27;t a de facto specification or book that I know of.
What are good examples or templates for a high level design that you use for describing distributed systems? Is there a book or similar resource that I&#x27;m missing?

          <p>I&#x27;m building an RSS feed reader w/ Ads. One concern I have is to ensure that I dont violate any copyright laws. I googled a lot but I dont have a clear answer one way or the other.
Also, somewhat related, I believe LinkedIn lost the website scraping lawsuit. Does that mean we can now scrape all we want and I&#x27;m wondering if RSS feed reader fall into this category?
Appreciate any help in this regard! Thank you!

          <p>The Chrome team has been working on options to bring back full prerendering of future pages that a user is likely to navigate to. This modern reboot of prerendering will start rolling out from Chrome 108.
# A brief history of prerender
In the past, Chrome supported the 
 resource hint, however it was not broadly supported beyond Chrome, and it wasn&#x27;t a very expressive API.
This legacy prerendering via the link rel&#x3D;prerender hint was deprecated in favor of NoState Prefetch, which instead fetched the resources needed by the future page, but did not fully prerender the page nor execute JavaScript. NoState Prefetch does help improve page performance by improving the resource loading, but will not deliver an instant page load like a full prerender would.

          <p>Web crawling in this day and age is loaded with caveats, and must be done carefully as to not put an unnecessary load on other people&#x27;s infrastructure. I&#x27;d really like to try to make my own web search tool, so I&#x27;m trying to scope out something simple enough to get me started. Here&#x27;s what I have so far.
- I don&#x27;t want to parse anything in the SimilarWeb Top 50.
- I don&#x27;t want to render JS
- I&#x27;d like to keep a web index that is still measured in TBs
I&#x27;ve done search engines for research papers in the past. The key difference was that I could collect that data very easily through a documented API. Now I need to either build or use a crawler and I&#x27;m not sure where to begin. Here are some thoughts that I have so far.
- I&#x27;m probably going to write the crawler in Go. It seems like a good fit for this sort of software.
- How do I start collecting lists of domains? Do I just start hitting public IPv4 addresses on Ports 80 and 443?
- If I run something like this with proper rate limiting on a server, would Cloudflare inevitably just start blocking me?
- If I were to run this from a machine connected to the Internet via a residential ISP, then would I get a nasty letter from my ISP?
Any advice or feedback is appreciated. The goal of this project is to learn more about web crawling moreso than to build a product that would be sold.

          <p>I would like to introduce a library I&#x27;m currently working on. It is more similar to selectorlib - where it defines the Selector definitions in YAML file, but with the difference, that it supports more than one selector per field, which in turn allows you to have one yaml definition per different HTML variations of a website. It also tries to validate the selector expressions before running the parsing. At this point I am looking for some feedback, so I can improve.

          <p>I built a habit tracker https://flathabits.com to scratch an itch. I really wanted to do the right thing for the users. The driving principles were as follows:
- Privacy. These are your personal habits (and they stay on your phone). I want zero access to your data.
- Minimal friction. Habit tracking requires dedication, so it should require almost no effort to stay on top of it.
- No gimmicks. Really, no games, prizes, etc. Just want to build an effective tool.
- No lock-in. Your data is yours. It is saved locally to a text file you can inspect or export at any time.
- No sign-up or account. There really is no need for it. Period.
- No social. Social really just gets in the way. These are your habits, focus on them.
- No analytics. None of any kind. If you like the app or there&#x27;s a bug, just report it.
- Text-based. Not that it matters to many users, but all data is stored to a text file in org mode.
I&#x27;ve used the app thoroghly and managed to rack up a decent year and a half of continuous running and meditation amongst other habits. The app has 114 ratings (across all countries) with a 4.8 score. But, the app hasn&#x27;re really picked up many users (1-5 daily downloads) even as a free app.
So, what is this habit tracker missing? What do you actually want in a habit tracker?

          <p>Accept-Language Reduction is an effort to reduce passive fingerprinting
surfaces by reducing the user&#x27;s language preferences in the
Accept-Language
header and only sending the user&#x27;s most preferred language (just one).
Beginning with the Chrome 109
Beta, we&#x27;ll open up
the origin trial
for Accept-Language Reduction enabling sites to opt into receiving the reduced
Accept-Language header. This will allow sites to discover and fix problems
before the reduced Accept-Language becomes the default behavior in Chrome in a
future release. To test the feature before it launches to stable population, be
sure to opt in and test before the release date for Chrome 109 (currently
scheduled for Jan 10th, 2023).

          <p># Overview
Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC) is a proposed web
standard that allows
customers to authenticate with a credit card issuer, bank, or other payment
service provider using a platform authenticator—typically activated with a
device&#x27;s screen unlock feature such as a fingerprint sensor. This usually
happens during a payments authentication protocol such as EMV 3-D
Secure or Open
Banking. EMV 3-D Secure, for example,
has support for SPC in its v2.3 spec
release.
We previously announced that SPC was
launched for Google Chrome on macOS and Windows and provided developer guides
for both registration and
authentication.
As of M109 (currently on the Beta channel), SPC will also be available on Google
Chrome on Android. Users will be able to use their device&#x27;s screen lock to
complete the …</p>

Ecosystem feedback has highlighted cross-site use cases that will be impacted when third-party cookies are no longer supported in Chrome. The First-Party Sets proposal examines and addresses a class of cross-site use cases in which the interdependent sites share a relationship that can be expressed to the browser such that the browser can take the appropriate action on behalf of the user and/or effectively present that information to the user.
The updated proposal uses two APIs (the Storage Access API and a new API tentatively named requestStorageAccessForOrigin) to provide sites with an active method of requesting cross-site access for their cookies within a First-Party Set. The instructi…</p>

          <a href=https://daverupert.com/2022/11/50-colors-akira/ target="_blank">They invented fifty colors for Akira</a>
          <p>I was reading about Akira the other day and stumbled across an interesting casual fact:
Painstakingly animated by hand, the care that went into Akira can be seen in every frame; there’s 327 different colour shades in the film, 50 of which were invented for it.
Fifty colors! Invented! An incredulous claim, but here’s a clip from a contemporaneous behind-the-scenes VHS documentary of Akria explaining the situation with the invented colors.

To accommodate the dark themes of the film and the five-stage variations of character shading, they added 50 shades of color to the commonly-used animation color palette. You can see the physical color palette in a couple places in the clip.
Kimie Yamana adding more… ahem… color… to the topic.
If you look at the color chart you’ll see the tremendous variety of dark tones. Many colors you wouldn’t see in other animation. There’s such subtlety in the various tones, you wouldn’t notice them on a television screen. But in the theater the large variety of colors really makes a difference.
Adding more, almost imperceptible, tones to the color palette allowed the neon-noir setting of a cyberpunk Neo Tokyo to thrive. Light plays a major role in the film and the use of color allowed the city itself to come alive as a character. A shadowy city that has light, life, and explosions.
Impressive. If you watch the whole behind the scenes video, you get a sense of the massive undertaking that was Akira. Blockbuster budgets and all the big name studios pitching in to make something bigger than themselves. Something timeless. Something breathtaking.</p>

          <a href=https://daverupert.com/2022/11/dragon-s-heaven/ target="_blank">Dragon&#x27;s Heaven</a>
          <p>Dragon’s Heaven is an eccentric anime directed by Makoto Hashimoto that —after hearing about it— I instantly dropped everything to watch it. It’s a giant robot mech anime with a Mœbius-”inspired” aesthetic. Actually, it’s a 100% rip-off of Mœbius, but it’s so well executed it stands on its own as something uniquely original (in a “great artists steal” kind of way). All the sand blowing and dimpled grunge effects that characterize Mœbius’s work were done by hand frame by frame… it’s a stunning work of art.
The sci-fi stands on its own as well. It’s the story of Ikuru, a girl in the year 3195 who awakens a robot named Shaian who has been dormant for 1,000 years. Shaian deactivated itself after a battle when its human copilot was killed in action. Shaian soon discovers his nemesis is still operational and doing battle in Brazil. It’s a Machines vs. Machines+Humans story with an assertive female protagonist. It makes you think about the relationships between humans and machines; will it be symbiotic or authoritarian? Also the notion that machines will outlive their human counterparts by millennia and hold on to centuries-long beef is interesting to think about as we feed machines with our biases in the present day.
But that’s not all! It gets weirder (beyond the awkward robot-human innuendo). The film is sandwiched between a poorly shot, ultra-smokey practical effects title sequence on the frontside and a documentary of how the director himself made the title sequence on the backside. It has the vibe of a gritty 1980s behind-the-scenes (like Alien or Star Wars) but also the air that no one could tell Hashimoto “No, this model thing isn’t good.” Some human quirks wrapped up in a film about two embattled robots.
If you’re curious about something called “Dragon’s Heaven” but has very little to do with actual dragons, I recommend it on the artwork alone. Feel free to skip all the non-anime parts.</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/webauthn-conditional-ui/ target="_blank">Passwordless sign-in on forms with WebAuthn passkey autofill</a>
          <p>Chrome 108 supports passkeys, including autofill suggestions. This allows sites
to build easy sign-in experiences that are more secure.
# What is a passkey?
A passkey is a digital credential, tied to a user account and a website or application. Passkeys are more secure than
passwords because they enable users to sign in to apps and websites with a
biometric sensor (such as a fingerprint or facial recognition), PIN, or pattern,
freeing them from having to remember and manage passwords. Because they are
WebAuthn credentials, they include the
following security features:
Passkeys use public-key cryptography so sites don&#x27;t have to store passwords or secrets.
Users can&#x27;t be phished because a passkey can only be used with the website or app that created it.
Websites could create and use WebAuthn credentials on devices and
security keys via a modal UI in the browser. To do so, websites had to
redesign their sign-in flow to let users select the WebAuthn flow using a
separate button. By allowing passkeys to enable autofill, websites can now
provide the same experience for both password and passkey users.
# Conditional UI
Allowing websites to make a WebAuthn request without triggering the modal UI is
called &quot;conditional mediation&quot;. This autofill integration is often referred to
as a conditional
UI.
          
  A user signing in with a condtional UI

# How it works
As soon as the user taps on the username input field, an autofill suggestion
dialog pops up with the stored passkeys and password autofill suggestions. The
user can then choose an account and use the device screen lock to sign in. This
enables users to sign in to the website with the existing password form as if
nothing has changed, but with the added security benefit of
passkeys.
# How to use conditional UI
To use the WebAuthn conditional UI, learn how to Create a passkey for
passwordless logins and Sign in with a
passkey through form autofill.

          <p>TL;DR: The Extensions API has been updated to support back/forward cache,
preloading navigations. See below for details.
Chrome has been working hard at making navigation fast. Instant Navigation
technologies such as Back/Forward Cache
(shipped on desktop in
Chrome 96) and Speculation Rules
(shipped in Chrome 103) improve both the going back and going forward
experience. In this post we will explore the updates we’ve made to browser
extensions APIs to accommodate these new workflows.
# Understanding the types of pages
Prior to the introduction of Back/Forward Cache and prerendering, an individual
tab only had one active page. This was always the one that was visible. If a
user returns to the previous page, the active page would be destroyed (Page B)
and the previous page in history would b…</p>

          <p>You ever want to grab a still frame from a video you’re watching online? Here’s a trick I use from time to time to get video stills from HTML  and avoid all the fussy hover-activated UI bits.
Pause the video at the timestamp you want
Open the DevTools &gt; Console
Target the right context and paste this in the console…

const v &#x3D; document.querySelector(&#x27;video&#x27;)
let c &#x3D; document.createElement(&#x27;canvas&#x27;)
c.height &#x3D; v.videoHeight || parseInt(v.style.height)
c.width &#x3D; v.videoWidth || parseInt(v.style.width)
const ctx &#x3D; c.getContext(&#x27;2d&#x27;)
ctx.drawImage(v, 0, 0)
const wnd &#x3D; window.open(&#x27;&#x27;)
wnd.document.write(&#x60;&#x60;)


This will open a new page with an image captured from the current timestamp. Then you can right-click &gt; save as… or drag it to your desktop, whatever you want to do. Enjoy!</p>

I’m Adriana Jara. Let’s dive in and see what’s new for developers in Chrome 108.
# New viewport size units
The new viewport units give you more control to create adaptive UIs.
These units measure the viewport area differently, as they take into account UI elements in the browser that can be expanded or collapsed. For example, the address bar.
The large units provide the viewport size assuming that those user agent interfaces are collapsed.
On the other hand the small units provide viewport size assumin…</p>

When screen sharing starts, Conditional Focus allows the capturing web app to control whether the browser focuses the captured tab or window, or whether the capturing tab remains active.
The suppressLocalAudioPlayback option controls whether the audio playing in a tab would be played out of the user’s local speakers.
# Conditional Focus
Using Conditional Focus, web apps can now control whether the captured tab or window will be focused when capture starts, or whether the capturing page should remain in focus.

// Prompt the user to share a tab, a window or a screen.

          <p>Twitter, it’s not me—it’s you.
In October of 2019, I gave a talk at Jamstack Conf San Francisco titled Owning your Content on Social Media.
For this talk I built a social media platform: MySpaceBook.​info, the only social media site exclusively for astronauts. Unfortunately midway through the presentation an investor called me up to make an offer on the site and I was left with no choice but to sell it, taking all of the user data down with it.
Apropros of nothing and in no way related to the scenario foretold in prophecy, I’m no longer hanging around on Twitter.
In the Jamstack Conf talk, I went through how one might build a local archive of your Twitter content, as I had done and documented separately a month or two prior. This archive now lives at zachleat.com/twitter/.
Cue crickets.

          <p>One of our family pandemic purchases was an electronic piano, a Yamaha P-121. My son was showing interest in music and we thought we’d be good parents and nurture that. His interest waned fast (read: in minutes), but I still play it! I grew up with a piano in the house so I’ve always been able to noodle, and I took a class in college, but I’ve never been able to fluently read sheet music enough to enjoy playing the piano. That is until I found E-Z Play Today music books1.

E-Z Play Today music books are beginner level books that take the mystery out of musical notation. Each note gets its corresponding letter inside it, no stacked notes, and bass chords written in a boxes above the staff. It’s guitar tabs but for piano and I love it.
Are they the exact notes? No.
Are the melodies just single notes? Yes.
Does it help me learn musical notation? Maybe.
Are almost all the songs transposed to the Key of C so they’re easier to play? Yes.
E-Z Play Today meets me where I am. It’s almost exactly what I want out of a song book; “Here’s the minimum viable version of this well-known song.” I have no dreams of becoming a concert pianist, I just want to enjoy playing the piano without feeling illiterate and uncoordinated. My left hand is playing a melody and my right hand is holding down a chord. Easy.
As dumbed down as this may be, I’m enjoying the approach and there’s a wide variety of genres and artists in their collection. I’m sure I’ll buy more. I broke out the Christmas song book in November and it’s been a small bit of joy to fill the house with some holiday spirit.

          <p>I am writing a web app with the intention of evolving the app as and when the requirements evolve.
While writing the code I am faced with the dilemma of whether to just provide mechanisms at the lower level and push the policy handling at the higher levels, or just flatten the design and handle both mechanism and policies at the same level.
There are pros and cons of both approaches.
So how does one overcome this dilemma when dealing with evolving requirements?
