For the record, these are equivalent:\ndiv {\n  border-radius: 10% 20% 30% 75%;\n}\ndiv {\n  border-top-left-radius: 10%;\n  border-top-right-radius: 20%;\n  border-bottom-right-radius: 30%;\n  border-bottom-left-radius: 75%;\n}\nIn the shorthand, we start from the top left corner, and go round clockwise, ending with the bottom left.\nIronically,…",

Writing, code, art… all with computers nipping at the heels with competency and speed. Fascinating. Unexpected in my lifetime. A mild bit alarming, but fascinating nonetheless.\nI don’t think it’s all bad, but my brain is still ramping up to the new reality that these handicrafts have (likely) been permanently altered. We should celebrate the lower bar for creative endeavors; you no longer need to be an expert at Photoshop to produce a creative image, just an expert at generating prompts. People are extracting beautiful artifacts from these machines. Incredible.\nAs interesting a future this creates, I’m a member of an old caste of people that still believes massive gains don’t come without realized costs; or more explicitly, electricity isn’t the only cost. What if the cost we’re paying is our perception of reality itself? It’s increasingly likely that the next thing you read or watch is the product of a content extruder. Your favorite author, artist, creator, influencer, job applicant, or manager; the curtain pulled back to reveal a series of six word prompts.

          "description": "I was reading about Akira the other day and stumbled across an interesting casual fact:\nPainstakingly animated by hand, the care that went into Akira can be seen in every frame; there’s 327 different colour shades in the film, 50 of which were invented for it.\nFifty colors! Invented! An incredulous claim, but here’s a clip from a contemporaneous behind-the-scenes VHS documentary of Akria explaining the situation with the invented colors.\n\nTo accommodate the dark themes of the film and the five-stage variations of character shading, they added 50 shades of color to the commonly-used animation color palette. You can see the physical color palette in a couple places in the clip.\nKimie Yamana adding more… ahem… color… to the topic.\nIf you look at the color chart you’ll see the tremendous variety of dark tones. Many colors you wouldn’t see in other animation. There’s such subtlety in the various tones, you wouldn’t notice them on a television screen. But in the theater the large variety of colors really makes a difference.\nAdding more, almost imperceptible, tones to the color palette allowed the neon-noir setting of a cyberpunk Neo Tokyo to thrive. Light plays a major role in the film and the use of color allowed the city itself to come alive as a character. A shadowy city that has light, life, and explosions.\nImpressive. If you watch the whole behind the scenes video, you get a sense of the massive undertaking that was Akira. Blockbuster budgets and all the big name studios pitching in to make something bigger than themselves. Something timeless. Something breathtaking.",

          "description": "Dragon’s Heaven is an eccentric anime directed by Makoto Hashimoto that —after hearing about it— I instantly dropped everything to watch it. It’s a giant robot mech anime with a Mœbius-”inspired” aesthetic. Actually, it’s a 100% rip-off of Mœbius, but it’s so well executed it stands on its own as something uniquely original (in a “great artists steal” kind of way). All the sand blowing and dimpled grunge effects that characterize Mœbius’s work were done by hand frame by frame… it’s a stunning work of art.\nThe sci-fi stands on its own as well. It’s the story of Ikuru, a girl in the year 3195 who awakens a robot named Shaian who has been dormant for 1,000 years. Shaian deactivated itself after a battle when its human copilot was killed in action. Shaian soon discovers his nemesis is still operational and doing battle in Brazil. It’s a Machines vs. Machines+Humans story with an assertive female protagonist. It makes you think about the relationships between humans and machines; will it be symbiotic or authoritarian? Also the notion that machines will outlive their human counterparts by millennia and hold on to centuries-long beef is interesting to think about as we feed machines with our biases in the present day.\nBut that’s not all! It gets weirder (beyond the awkward robot-human innuendo). The film is sandwiched between a poorly shot, ultra-smokey practical effects title sequence on the frontside and a documentary of how the director himself made the title sequence on the backside. It has the vibe of a gritty 1980s behind-the-scenes (like Alien or Star Wars) but also the air that no one could tell Hashimoto “No, this model thing isn’t good.” Some human quirks wrapped up in a film about two embattled robots.\nIf you’re curious about something called “Dragon’s Heaven” but has very little to do with actual dragons, I recommend it on the artwork alone. Feel free to skip all the non-anime parts.",

His interest waned fast (read: in minutes), but I still play it! I grew up with a piano in the house so I’ve always been able to noodle, and I took a class in college, but I’ve never been able to fluently read sheet music enough to enjoy playing the piano. That is until I found E-Z Play Today music books1.\n\nE-Z Play Today music books are beginner level books that take the mystery out of musical notation. Each note gets its corresponding letter inside it, no stacked notes, and bass chords written in a boxes above the staff. It’s guitar tabs but for piano and I love it.\nAre they the exact notes? No.\nAre the melodies just single notes? Yes.\nDoes it help me learn musical notation? Maybe.\nAre almost all the songs transposed to the Key of C so they’re easier to play? Yes.\nE-Z Play Today meets me where I am. It’s almost exactly what I want out of a song book; “Here’s the minimum viable version of this well-known song.” I have no dreams of becoming a concert pianist, I just want to enjoy playing the piano without feeling illiterate and uncoordinated. My left hand is playing a melody and my right hand is holding down a chord. Easy.\nAs dumbed down as this may be, I’m enjoying the approach and there’s a wide variety of genres and artists in their collection. I’m sure I’ll buy more. I broke out the Christmas song book in November and it’s been a small bit of joy to fill the house with some holiday spirit.\nNever change this website please. ↩",

This allows sites\nto build easy sign-in experiences that are more secure.\n# What is a passkey?\nA passkey is a digital credential, tied to a user account and a website or application. Passkeys are more secure than\npasswords because they enable users to sign in to apps and websites with a\nbiometric sensor (such as a fingerprint or facial recognition), PIN, or pattern,\nfreeing them from having to remember and manage passwords. Because they are\nWebAuthn credentials, they include the\nfollowing security features:\nPasskeys use public-key cryptography so sites don't have to store passwords or secrets.\nUsers can't be phished because a passkey can only be used with the website or app that created it.\nWebsites could create and use WebAuthn credentials on devices and\nsecurity keys via a modal UI in the browser. To do so, websites had to\nredesign their sign-in flow to let users select the WebAuthn flow using a\nseparate button. By allowing passkeys to enable autofill, websites can now\nprovide the same experience for both password and passkey users.\n# Conditional UI\nAllowing websites to make a WebAuthn request without triggering the modal UI is\ncalled \"conditional mediation\". This autofill integration is often referred to\nas a conditional\nUI.\n          \n  A user signing in with a condtional UI\n\n# How it works\nAs soon as the user taps on the username input field, an autofill suggestion\ndialog pops up with the stored passkeys and password autofill suggestions. The\nuser can then choose an account and use the device screen lock to sign in. This\nenables users to sign in to the website with the existing password form as if\nnothing has changed, but with the added security benefit of\npasskeys.\n# How to use conditional UI\nTo use the WebAuthn conditional UI, learn how to Create a passkey for\npasswordless logins and Sign in with a\npasskey through form autofill.\nPhoto by Scott Graham on Unsplash",

          "description": "I like how ActivityPub can be implemented on any website and provide a good set of endpoints to enable rich, social-media-like content interactions. I'd love to enable my current website to respond to those requests, but I don't want to either use \"activitypub-express\" or install a full Mastodon (or any other) server just for myself.\nMy idea was to implement the protocol myself, which would be a nice way to learn it and its problems. But I would also love to make it a library that can be applied by others on their own, already existing websites.\nThe problem that I am having is that the current methods to implement this kind of pluggable extension involve connecting to one specific back end framework, such as creating an Express middleware.\nWhat I was thinking was:\n- Use TypeScript (to leverage the large JS community)\n- Make it as vanilla as possible\n- Use fetch standards such as the Request and Response objects, which are available natively since Node 18\n- Provide multiple adapters for common frameworks such as Express, Fastify, Next.js, Astro, etc\nIs this solved elegantly on any other language or framework?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34037748\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nDuring this year we have been building Depoxy, a tool for managing and optimizing data pipelines on AWS.\nThe main reasons for building Depoxy are:\nthe current UIs for managing data pipelines are inefficient\noptimizing data pipelines has a lot of potential both in CO2 and financial terms\nWhere is this inefficiency coming from and how much better we can get?\nThe UI and the tooling around data services are not integrated at the level it is optimal. This is the reason why having an integrated UI improves the workflows by 50% (22s vs 54s). You can check out the video we have about a simple workflow.\nHow much optimization?\nWe have 10 years experience with various clients in this space and based on the previous experiences the optimization potential is between 10 - 30% year over year infrastructure cost. This is a lot for many companies, especially nowadays.\nWhere are we with this product?\nThis is the first iteration of the product and we just got started. The next iteration is going to be metadata analytics engine for data that is stored on AWS S3. Based on the metadata we can get insight into the efficiency of the data set and provide guidance for optimizing it.\nThe second next iteration we are planning to implement a SQL parsing engine that provides automatic data lineage so that people can track how data flows through their system.\nDetailed blog post with a lot more:\nhttps://www.depoxy.dev/blog/2022-12-07-introducing-depoxy\nLet us know what you think. If you find any problems, issues (even security bugs) please let us know. Thank you in advance.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33896367\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Genuine question: if one were to architect a web app to use disk for storage, rather than a database, how would one do it?\nLately, there's been a lot of buzz about SQLite, and I myself have been impressed with DuckDB. I've also found myself doing my prototyping using plain JSON files on disk, and then \"productionizing\" to use a database when I need to deploy.\nSo: suppose I wanted to be able to have multiple web servers - it's nice to be able to create more servers as needed - read and write data to a disk. What would one do? What's the easiest way to share files across multiple servers? How do you ensure you have enough disk? Or partition traffic?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33754038\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I am willing to bet (inflation-adjusted) 1000$ that in the next decade, multiple teams will see the advent of Wasm and WebGPU as a perfect reason to have yet another go at a cross-plattform UI framework. These projects will claim to have \"native\" UI elements, but it will be obvious that the are really just rebuilding everything to look like the native counterparts (similar to Flutter). Especially on macOS and iOS, major interactions will be unsupported or implemented in wrong ways (problems will likely occur around the menu bar, keyboard navigation, and integration with OS services). Scrolling will feel off on touchscreen devices and text rendering will differ from the native look. Still, some of these frameworks will have tens of thousands of stars on GitHub and be used by major companies. I would not be surprised if these frameworks were built with Rust and be seen by many as the thing that would finally bring Rust to the mainstream. I see it as likely that in whatever language these frameworks will be written, they will introduce some weird new syntax and paradigms to accomodate a more \"intuitive\" (probably declarative) style of writing UI code. Meanwhile, little to no progress will be made developing techniques and frameworks to build apps that are actually better for the end user.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33730173\nPoints: 27\n# Comments: 11",

These are your personal habits (and they stay on your phone). I want zero access to your data.\n- Minimal friction. Habit tracking requires dedication, so it should require almost no effort to stay on top of it.\n- No gimmicks. Really, no games, prizes, etc. Just want to build an effective tool.\n- No lock-in. Your data is yours. It is saved locally to a text file you can inspect or export at any time.\n- No sign-up or account. There really is no need for it. Period.\n- No social. Social really just gets in the way. These are your habits, focus on them.\n- No analytics. None of any kind. If you like the app or there's a bug, just report it.\n- Text-based. Not that it matters to many users, but all data is stored to a text file in org mode.\nI've used the app thoroghly and managed to rack up a decent year and a half of continuous running and meditation amongst other habits. The app has 114 ratings (across all countries) with a 4.8 score. But, the app hasn're really picked up many users (1-5 daily downloads) even as a free app.\nSo, what is this habit tracker missing? What do you actually want in a habit tracker?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33842599\nPoints: 11\n# Comments: 10",

          "description": "I built a habit tracker https://flathabits.com to scratch an itch. I really wanted to do the right thing for the users. The driving principles were as follows:\n- Privacy. These are your personal habits (and they stay on your phone). I want zero access to your data.\n- Minimal friction. Habit tracking requires dedication, so it should require almost no effort to stay on top of it.\n- No gimmicks. Really, no games, prizes, etc. Just want to build an effective tool.\n- No lock-in. Your data is yours. It is saved locally to a text file you can inspect or export at any time.\n- No sign-up or account. There really is no need for it. Period.\n- No social. Social really just gets in the way. These are your habits, focus on them.\n- No analytics. None of any kind. If you like the app or there's a bug, just report it.\n- Text-based. Not that it matters to many users, but all data is stored to a text file in org mode.\nI've used the app thoroghly and managed to rack up a decent year and a half of continuous running and meditation amongst other habits. The app has 114 ratings (across all countries) with a 4.8 score. But, the app hasn're really picked up many users (1-5 daily downloads) even as a free app.\nSo, what is this habit tracker missing? What do you actually want in a habit tracker?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33819202\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Back in the day (late 90s), Microsoft had a format called \"HTML Application.\"\nIt was just an HTML page with a \".hta\" file extension. Opening such a file would open it in a chrome-less browser, and give the scripting in the page access to the file system.\nI used to love these things. I wrote a bunch of little apps in them.\nSome examples:\nhttps://medium.com/@anht_59851/html-application-hta-a-gui-for-your-scripting-on-windows-bfaacf2c3bdd\nThese still exist, but there are problems with them:\n1. Coding is a bear. They run in the mshta.exe process, and that spawns an instance of... IE9, I think? There's no \"inspect\" panel, for instance, and errors just pop a modal with no debugging information.\n2. Near as I can tell, they use an older version of ECMAScript. \"let\" doesn't seem to work, not does \"addEventListener,\" etc. I kept getting weird \"Syntax Errors\" for things that appeared to be valid, contemporary JavaScript.\n3. I'm quite sure some security software (like on my laptop, issued by employer), blocks these from executing.\nWhat's the current-day equivalent of these?  I want to write an HTML page complete with CSS and JS, double-click on it from my desktop, have it open in a browser instance of its own, and have access to the file system.\nI essentially want a way to create little GUI apps, without having to use WinForms.\nWhat am I looking for? Is it Electron?\n(Note: I'm on Windows)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34014642\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I am so impressed with how far we have come with HTML and CSS over the years.  But printing still leaves orphaned headers at the bottom of pages and splits paragraphs so that 1% of my paragraph is on a page by itself.\n and \n are the bread and butter of semantic text on the web.  Is there still no way of heuristically placing them on the printed page, in a way that looks typographically reasonable?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33900648\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 3",

          "description": "Web crawling in this day and age is loaded with caveats, and must be done carefully as to not put an unnecessary load on other people's infrastructure. I'd really like to try to make my own web search tool, so I'm trying to scope out something simple enough to get me started. Here's what I have so far.\n- I don't want to parse anything in the SimilarWeb Top 50.\n- I don't want to render JS\n- I'd like to keep a web index that is still measured in TBs\nI've done search engines for research papers in the past. The key difference was that I could collect that data very easily through a documented API. Now I need to either build or use a crawler and I'm not sure where to begin. Here are some thoughts that I have so far.\n- I'm probably going to write the crawler in Go. It seems like a good fit for this sort of software.\n- How do I start collecting lists of domains? Do I just start hitting public IPv4 addresses on Ports 80 and 443?\n- If I run something like this with proper rate limiting on a server, would Cloudflare inevitably just start blocking me?\n- If I were to run this from a machine connected to the Internet via a residential ISP, then would I get a nasty letter from my ISP?\nAny advice or feedback is appreciated. The goal of this project is to learn more about web crawling moreso than to build a product that would be sold.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33824222\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

It also tries to validate the selector expressions before running the parsing.
