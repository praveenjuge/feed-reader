          "description": "The first speakers are live on the UX London 2022 site! There are only five people announced for now—just enough to give you a flavour of what to expect. There will be many, many more.\nPutting together the line-up of a three-day event is quite challenging, but kind of fun too. On the one hand, each day should be able to stand alone. After all, there are one-day tickets available. On the other hand, it should feel like one cohesive conference, not three separate events.\nI’ve decided to structure the three days to somewhat mimic the design process…\nThe first day is all about planning and preparation. This is like the first diamond in the double-diamond process: building the right thing. That means plenty of emphasis on research.\nThe second day is about creation and execution. It’s like that …",

If I win, that money goes to the Bletchley Park Trust. If Matt wins, it goes to The Internet Archive.\nI’m very happy to lose this bet.\nWhen I made the original prediction eleven years ago that a URL on the longbets.org site would no longer be available, I did so in a spirit of mischief—it was a deliberately meta move. But it was also informed by a genuine feeling of pessimism around the longevity of links on the web.

Like everyone else running conferences, we had to pivot in the face of The Situation.\nIn hindsight, it’s remarkable how well those online events went. This was new territory for everyone—speakers, attendees, and organisers.\nUX Fest was a real highlight. I had the pleasure of hosting the event, giving it my Woganesque best. It was hard work, but it paid off.\nStill, it’s not quite the same as gathering together with your peers in one place for a shared collective experience. I’ve really been missing in-person events (and from what I’ve seen in people’s end-of-year blog posts, I’m not alone).\nThat’s why I’m absolutely thrilled that UX London is back in 2022!

Besides, some of us don’t work on Fridays. So Thursday really is the new Friday.\nAt this Thursday afternoon meeting we give and get updates on what’s been happening with project work, new business, events, marketing. We also highlighted any shout-outs that have posted in the #beingsplendid Slack channel during the week.

          "description": "Fershad Irani’s tool lets you check if your third-party scripts use green hosting.\n\nRecently I’ve been thinking quite a bit about third-party scripts and how much bloat they so often add to the average webpage — and, consequently, their impact on climate change via the additional carbon emissions generated, often for something the end user doesn’t really want or need. Third-party scripts can include ads, trackers, analytics, social media embeds, and probably some other stuff too. An analysis by Marmelab found that up to 70% of the carbon footprint of media websites could be attributed to ads and stats (source).\nOften we as developers aren’t in a position to remove these things entirely, and the conversation around web monetisation is a complex one. But we should at least load them as responsibly as possible. (I wrote about some strategies for optimising social media embeds for Smashing Magazine.)\nOne thing we might not consider, however, is whether the third parties themselves use green web hosting — that is, hosting that is powered by renewable energy. Fershad Irani has developed a useful tool that analyses the third-party scripts on your website: Are My Third Parties Green? checks whether they use a green web host (to the best of knowledge, via The Green Web Foundation’s dataset), as well as how much of your site’s overall size comes from third-party scripts, how effectively they’re cached, and their estimated carbon emissions.\nTools like this are great for shining a light on the environmental impact of our websites. Although measuring the carbon emissions of a website is far from an exact science, projects like this help raise awareness, and enable us to begin conversations and increasingly make informed choices.\nVisit the site →",

He writes:\nThe very act of recording your actions and impressions is itself powerfully mnemonic, fixing the moment more durably in your memory so that it’s easier to recall in future, even if you never consult your notes.\nThat’s certainly the way it works for me. I find the best way to learn about a technical concept is by writing about it. Often I’ll refer back to a blog post I’ve written in the past, to refresh my memory.

          "description": "Earlier this month I has the pleasure of speaking at a special green-themed edition of Toronto Web Performance Meetup (online). There were three of us speaking in all, each with a different take on how we as web developers can reduce our environmental impact.\nWeb Performance And The Planet\nFershad Irani spoke about how web performance relates to our site’s carbon emissions, and the concrete actions we can take to build our sites greener. His article analysing the COP26 website helped inspire my own article for CSS Tricks on website carbon budgets.\nWatch Fershad’s talk →\nSee the slides →\nBuilding a Greener Web\nMy own talk was about the wider context around reducing our website’s environmental impact, how we can convince stakeholders to make it a priority, and why individual action matters. I also talked about some of the things we can do beyond making our websites greener, as part of the wider community.\nWatch the talk →\nSee the slides →\nThe Carbon Footprint of Images\nJon A. Særetås talked about images on the web, and how we can reduce their environmental impact. His talk included some really interesting data, and some surprising details we don’t often consider — like the fact that many of our file live on in the cloud indefinitely, meaning they continue to consume resources.\nWatch Jon’s talk →\nSee the slides →\nYou might notice that this post avoids including YouTube embeds. I recently wrote about the environmental and performance impact of third-party embeds for Smashing Magazine. Linking to the videos instead of embedding them vastly reduced the page weight — and saves you, the user, from downloading unnecessary resources if you choose not to watch the videos!",

I use Firefox as my main browser, which claims to protect privacy by blocking trackers. And to be honest, I don’t read a lot of articles on desktop, preferring to read the news on mobile while I’m on the go. While you might get one or two pop-ups on mobile, the area available for them is clearly a lot smaller, and I generally find the browsing experience for many of the sites I regularly visit is OK.\nMost of the sites I do visit on desktop are for my day-to-day job, or research for this blog, and are built with developers as the target audience.

          "description": "Maybe it’s just me, but I feel like a lot of the time learning new CSS features doesn’t involve just learning a what a single property does, more like getting to grips with a collection of properties and how they work together — even learning a whole specification. That’s certainly not a complaint from me: it makes sense to consider properties as part of an ecosystem. But I have to confess, I love it when a new CSS property lands in browsers that doesn’t have a steep learning curve and just works, with no fuss. The aspect-ratio property hits all the right spots there, neatly solving with a single line of CSS something that was, quite frankly, a bit of faff before. It’s been supported in browsers for going on a year now, but with Safari finally catching up in September 2021, we can finally …",

It turns out people on Windows want to edit videos too, so now I’m rewriting it with Rust, Electron, and Svelte with an eye for performance.\nRust is a systems programming language, akin to C or C++, but safer. It’s known for being super fast.\nElectron is a framework for building cross-platform desktop apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s known for being kinda slow and bloaty. But there’s an ace up its sleeve: Electron apps can be extended with compiled native code, and if you do the heavy stuff in native code you can a nice speed boost.\nSvelte is a JavaScript UI framework – an alternative to React, Vue, Angular, or one of the other 750…",

I’m not getting what I need in that time period, so let me just use the bathroom before the next interview.\n— @kyleshevlin\nI mentioned that I had a go-to list of questions that I literally printed and brought with me, and would bring out during this 5-minute lightning round.

Often in programming you hit a situation where you have to choose two paths:\nThe 15 minute fix\nThe 30 day fix (+30 days of repercussions)\nI know, I know, that’s a gross generalization but it’s related to the tension between speed and sustainability in software development. I’ll explain a bit further…\nThe 15 minute fix\nThe fifteen minute fix is the most direct way to solve the problem. A hard-coded value, installing a third-party library, adding another prop, or introducing a manual process to get the job done. You don’t have time to find the right abstraction, to write it yourself, think through all the edge cases, or automate the process.

          "description": "I know a bit about Japanese folk music (民謡), but Pete Seeger opened my eyes to and old song called  “Genbaku O Yurusumaji (Forgive us the atom bomb)”, an anti-nuclear Japanese dirge.\nBorn in the US in the cold war, it never seemed necessary to establish an anti-nuclear stance. It just was. A threat deterrent as much as a threat. Or so we told ourselves. Moving to Japan and witnessing Hiroshima changed that for me. The perspective the Japanese have changes your perspective.\nWith the current threat of atomic warfare, this song has been on my mind.\n\nふるさとの街やかれ\n身よりの骨うめし焼土に\n今は白い花咲く\nああ許すまじ原爆を    \n三度許すまじ原爆を    \nわれらの街に\n\nふるさとの海荒れて\n黒き雨喜びの日はなく\n今は舟に人もなし\nああ許すまじ原爆を\n三度許すまじ原爆を\nわれらの海に\n\nふるさとの空重く\n黒き雲今日も大地おおい\n今は空に陽もささず\nああ許すまじ原爆を\n三度許すまじ原爆を\nわれらの空に\n\nはらからのたえまなき\n労働にきずきあぐ富と幸\n今はすべてついえ去らん\nああ許すまじ原爆を\n三度許すまじ原爆を\n世界の上に\n\nThe city of my hometown\nWe buried the charred bones of our relatives\nWhite flowers are blooming now\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nIn our city\n\nThe sea of my hometown is rough\nThere is no day of joy in black rain\nThere are no people in the boats now\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nIn our sea\n\nThe sky of my hometown\nBlack clouds, the earth is covered today\nNow the sun isn't in the sky\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nIn our sky\n\nNo praise from the belly\nWealth and happiness is labor\nI can't leave everything now\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nOn top of the world",

          "description": "“The Accordion” (Τ’ ακορντεόν) is an old, popular Greek song written by Manos Loïzos (Μάνος Λοΐζος) in 1967 while Greece was under far-right military junta control. It’s an unassuming anti-fascist song with it’s slow, folksy tone and fluttering accompaniment, but it’s final words offer a somber battle cry: “Fascism will not prevail!”\nManos spent his latter years in the Soviet Union where he died in Moscow in 1982. I’m not sure if he ever escaped fascism (despotism?), but perhaps the communism of the Soviet Union suited him better than the military junta in Greece.\nI first heard this song on a news story about Orestes Fintiklis. Fintiklis was removing Trump’s name from his international hotel in Panama when a scuffle happened between security staff and the new management. Once the fight broken up, employees terminated, and Trump’s name removed from the hotel, Fintiklis sat down at the piano and played this song.\n\n\nΣτη γειτονιά μου την παλιά είχα ένα φίλο\nπου ήξερε και έπαιζε τ' ακορντεόν\nόταν τραγούδαγε φτυστός ήταν ο ήλιος\nφωτιές στα χέρια του άναβε τ' ακορντεόν\n\nΜα ένα βράδυ σκοτεινό σαν όλα τ' άλλα\nκράταγε τσίλιες παίζοντας ακορντεόν\nφασιστικά καμιόνια στάθηκαν στη μάντρα\nκαι μια ριπή σταμάτησε τ' ακορντεόν\n\nΤ' αρχινισμένο σύνθημα πάντα μου μένει\nόποτε ακούω από τότε ακορντεόν\nκι έχει σαν στάμπα τη ζωή μου σημαδέψει\nδε θα περάσει ο φασισμός\n\n\nIn my old neighborhood I had a friend\nwho knew and played the accordion\nwhen he sang, he was like the sun\nfires in his hands ignited by the accordion\n\nBut at one dark night, like every other night\nhe kept a look-out playing the accordion\nfascist trucks stood in the paddock\nand a gun shot stopped the accordion\n\nThe started slogan comes back to me\nwhenever I hear an accordion\nand it has marked my life like a stamp\n'Fascism will not prevail!'",

          "description": "Just released v0.3.2 of Hibiki HTML (lots of new changes and features)!\nThe biggest, from the feedback I got on HN, is that Hibiki HTML is now\nlicensed under the standard MPL v2 (Mozilla Public License v2, OSI\napproved), and is able to be integrated into any project (free,\ncommercial, or (A)GPL) without any fear over a non-standard license.\nI've also released a new Bulma UI control library for Hibiki -\nhttps://libs.hibikihtml.com/test-bulma.html .  It features buttons,\ntabs, menus, modals, great looking form inputs and controls, and a\nsimple data-table control with built in sorting and pagination!  There\nare also Hibiki HTML library wrappers for rendering markdown and code\nhighlighting.\nHibiki HTML is a great middle ground between vanilla HTML and full-on\nJS frameworks like React or Vue.  You can add dynamic functionality,\nreuseable components, and backend REST calls in a single HTML file.\nNo tools to install, no JavaScript stack to configure,\nno build process, and no need to be a JavaScript expert.\nIt works works great for embedding into backend\nservers (or scripts), tools to interact with REST APIs, or\nadding dynamic functionality to static sites.\nI'd love to to hear and answer any feedback, questions, or comments.\nIf you have a project you'd like to use Hibiki HTML on, I'm also happy\nto lend a hand or build out additional functionality or components you\nmight need.\n* Interactive Tutorial - https://playground.hibikihtml.com/tutorial/\n* Bulma UI Controls - https://libs.hibikihtml.com/test-bulma.html\n* Github - https://github.com/dashborg/hibiki\n* Discord - https://discord.gg/zbWV6ueED7\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30479980\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "eBPF is an amazing technology that allows safely running user-supplied functions at pretty much arbitrary probe points in a kernel/user space context. Much has been written about how amazing this feature is for kernel observability. But as someone who writes user space code, what I find even more amazing is the support for tracing arbitrary user space programs, with no code changes and low overhead.\nHowever, doing in-depth analysis can get complicated and time-consuming. My goal with wachy was to make this debugging significantly easier/faster to use, by displaying traces in a TUI next to the source code and allowing for interactive drilldown analysis. If you get a chance, check out the start of the demo video since (AFAIK) it's quite unique and gives a much clearer idea than I can provide with just text.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30422517\nPoints: 10\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hi all, author here.\nThis project was a pleasure to do, Remix has very good developer experience. But further than that it's actually a really good way to develop applications, it's a mix of old meets new where the paradigm encourages you to take advantage of web standards for data fetching (forms, links, a tags).\nAnd it turns out that it's actually an optimal way to develop simple or even complex web applications which can deploy in a number of runtime environments (including edge workers). So you can get an insanely fast website for users. Note that this project is not necessarily an optimal website implementation (since it copies Hacker News) but rather it's intended to be useful as a starting point or reference for your own projects!\nYou can read about some of the benefits of it on the project page linked.\nBy the way I'm currently available to work (if you email me at clinton.dannolfo @gmail!)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30373847\nPoints: 64\n# Comments: 44",

          "description": "I suck at CSS. There, I said it.\nI've always loved frameworks like Bootstrap, Bulma, etc... that let's me build frontends the same way I would play Legos as a kid.\nI understand CSS, what the properties do, individually. But I lack the creativity and design skills required to come up with half of what is provided by those frameworks. I could do it if I had infinite time and patience, but I don't.\nI've heard a lot of good about TailwindCSS for a couple of years now. So I gave it a try. From what I've gather after a few days, I don't understand it.\nInstead of writing CSS, I add classes to my HTML. Ok, but I don't want to rewrite everything all the time, it would be like using the inline style attribute.\nOk, then I install PostCSS, and start writing classes with @apply. Wait, hang on, isn't that just writing plain old CSS with a new syntax and new names to learn?\nI must be missing something, right?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30355757\nPoints: 25\n# Comments: 20",

If my phone is in my peripheral vision I will pick it up at some point to check what's happening on it. If I'm working on a problem and I'm not sure exactly what to do I pick up my phone (to sooth my nerves).\nI don't like the habit, but I have it.\nI used to pick up my phone to check online dating sites a lot, but now I am less interested in them. So I find myself picking up my phone and not really being sure what to do with it when it is in my hands.\nThere are two directions I can go in (I think):\n1. Stop picking up my phone as much. This means my brain needs to get better at holding that boring period where there are no inputs. (I must be a dopamine addict)\n2. Find something more interesting to look at when I pick up my phone (by the morning I will already have checked Reddit and the news, so need something new).\nDoes anyone have any ideas of interesting apps to look at that could turn this habit into something productive?\nDoes anyone have any success getting more comfortable \"holding\" the boredom? (Maybe I should buy a Rubik's cube?!)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30245071\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 3",

This article will show you three techniques to help you breathe deeper while working out.\n\n\nDeep breathing has been shown to increase oxygen levels in the blood, improve cardiovascular health, and even boost mood. The problem is that most people are not aware of breathing correctly during exercise.\n\n\nYou should inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. This helps prevent air from entering your lungs and causing them to collapse. You also open your chest and expand your ribcage when you breathe deeply. It is a great way to stretch the muscles of your upper back.\n\n\nWhen you breathe more deeply, you get more oxygen into your body. That means you are getting more energy d…",

Self-care is a vital element of stress management, even if it's difficult to prioritize when you have so many other things on your to-do list.\n\n\nHow Self-Care Can Help You\n\n\nWhen we're physically and emotionally exhausted, we're less equipped to handle the challenges that life throws at us. Or, to put it another way, when we are physically and emotionally at our best, we are more robust and capable of handling life's stress. A massage, a hot bath, or some other type of pampering rejuvenates you on the inside and out.

Grateful to the folks that have trusted Eleventy with their web projects, grateful to folks that have participated in our community, whether it be answering questions, writing blog posts, code, docs, or being friendly on Discord, Twitter, or at meetups.\nI'm grateful to everyone building for the open web—accessible to all—independent of walled gardens and app stores, where a wallet isn't a prerequisite.\nAnd I don't know if you all can tell, but I am so excited. If Eleventy was walking before now we're going to find out what it really feels like to run.\nStay tuned.",

Outcomes unknown.\nSo he's staring at a big loss. He called me to talk about it.\nHe asked me if I've ever experienced something like this, and how I coped with it.\nI absolutely have, and I've always found that how you frame it has a huge impact on how you feel about it. It allows you to move on.\nI told him the way I've approached this sort of thing in the past is to frame it as \"overall, this job cost more than I expected\", rather than \"This guy fucked me, I'm out $X, and now I have to pay someone else $Y more to redo it\".\nYes, the total is the same, but one involves loss while the other involves missed expectations. I find it a lot easier to deal with underestimating total cost than feeling like I got screwed. Construction projects frequently go over budget. People deal with this all the time. The community is large! You're a member now.\nLoss aversion is of course how it's described, but applying technical definitions doesn't often change how you feel. Being able to reframe it does.",

Nearly 400 people applied for the position.\nAs applications tend to do, they ranged from the basic resume, to the standard cover letter and resume, to the custom cover letter and resume, and, finally, some more creative approaches to stand out.\nI wanted to share one, in particular. This application is shared with the applicant's permission, although it's been slightly modified to remove personal information they weren't comfortable sharing publicly.\nBeyond it being an exceptionally good application — you'll know why when you see it — it was the one that got the person the job.

The rider is our conscious reasoning—the stream of words and images of which we are fully aware. The elephant is the other 99 percent of mental processes—the ones that occur outside of awareness but that actually govern most of our behavior.\n\nIt's the same underlying premise to Julia Galaef's book The Scout Mindset.

          "description": "My favorite part of doing code reviews is to see all the trade-offs, design decisions, and changes in context together. You can't easily do that if your feature has been chopped into itty bitty pieces as independent pull requests under pressure never to let them run longer than a week. So at Basecamp, we let pull requests run as long as they need to encompass a complete feature or fix. That's everything from a few weeks up to as much as six (since we follow Shape Up).\nThis approach isn't entirely without trade-offs. The longer your pull request is running off the main branch, the greater the chance that you'll have merge conflicts. But you can mitigate much of this by ensuring you keep your pull request up to date with main by frequently merging main into the pull request. I can appreciate…",

Objections to this term has taken many forms. But they all seek to justify the opposite label of \"violent\", no matter the blind logical leaps required.\nSome claim that the background of certain organizers or participants as either anti-government, white supremacist, trumpers, conferate-flag-wavers, or whatever means that even if there were no (or only isolated) violent acts, that this still rendered the protests at large violent. Others that \"hateful rhetoric\" or \"unacceptable views\" was violence in speech.

One of which was this:\n\nDisneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us believe that the rest is real.\n\nIt's a novel illustration of the point both David Graeber and Yuval Noah Harari have kept making in their works: Human institutions are all, broadly speaking, make believe. \nWhere Harari illustrates this point with everything from the corporation to human rights, Graeber invites us to imagine fresh alternatives to debt and capitalism.

The long expansion of enabling concepts is now at last being compressed for human comprehension.
