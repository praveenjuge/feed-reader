          "description": "In 2010 I discovered input masks.\nThey seemed like a smart way to prevent errors. Because they help users follow a format. And they do so without taking up space.\nBut the truth is that this fancy pattern degrades UX.\nHere‚Äôs why:\nProblem #1: They‚Äôre confusing\nFor example, the cursor advances automatically to the next position. And placeholder characters can‚Äôt be deleted.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tTelephone input mask replacing characters and advancing to the next position automatically\n\t\n\nProblem #2: They may be mistaken for an actual answer\nThis is because the mask looks like an input causing using to submit the form with errors.\nInput masks make the input look like it‚Äôs been answered\n\t\n\nProblem #3: They make the interface feel broken\nThis is because typing a restricted character gets ignored.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRestricted characters get ignored without giving users any feedback\n\t\n\nProblem #4: The format may be unfamiliar\nFor example, a phone number may require a country code which isn‚Äôt always expected and makes users work harder.\nInput masks may use unfamiliar formats that don‚Äôt make sense to everyone\n\t\n\nProblem #5: They‚Äôre misleading and verbose in screen readers\nFor example, they announce placeholder characters which aren‚Äôt part of the answer. And they don‚Äôt announce characters that were typed but ignored.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tVoiceover announces placeholder characters. And fails to announce characters that were typed but ignored.\n\t\n\nWhat to do instead\nLeave the input empty to make it obvious where the answer goes\nLet users type what they like so the interface doesn‚Äôt feel unresponsive and broken\nAllow multiple formats so users don‚Äôt have to fix something unnecessarily\nAllow users to check their answers either on a separate page or just below the field",

It‚Äôs petite and looks like a regular leather dad chair before it‚Äôs glorious transformation into a relaxation station. Per tradition, kids aren‚Äôt allowed to use dad‚Äôs recliner; it‚Äôs the one sacred space in our house.\nThe recliner has been a major boost to my calmness. Having my feet up after a long day of sitting at my desk produces a psychological effect that scientists refer to as ‚Äúmaxin‚Äô and relaxin‚Äô‚Äù. This is not a sports-dad chair for yelling at my fantasy employees, oh no. This, my lovelies, is a book nook for a grown man. A stack of devices (iPad, Kindle, Macbook) sits piled next to the chair so I can follow whatever whim the Muses enchant me with, as the forefathers intended. President Ben Franklin once wrote in his diary ‚ÄúThe secret to Man‚Äôs creativity is having a sweet ass recumbent chair.‚Äù\nThis recliner will launch a thousand blog posts. This recliner is where I‚Äôll write the next great American sci-fi novel. This recliner is where I‚Äôll create apps and games late at night after the family goes to sleep. This recliner is where I‚Äôll nod off on lazy Saturday afternoons like a dog in the sun. This recliner is where I‚Äôll store decades and decades of farts until I die and my children‚Äôs children judiciously and uncaringly throw it in a dumpster, divorced of sentimentality and awareness of the suitcases of emotional baggage from grandpa‚Äôs ancient computer job that I unpacked in this chair.",

It could be my taste buds evolving, some secret recipe update, or the news that the WHO is saying aspartame as ‚Äúpossibly carcinogenic‚Äù‚Ä¶ but for whatever reason Diet Coke doesn‚Äôt taste as good to me as it used to, so I‚Äôm making changes. There‚Äôs a new beverage in my fridge: Liquid Death.\nLiquid Death? Isn‚Äôt that just water in a can? Yes, but specifically I‚Äôm enjoying the ‚ÄúGrim Leafer‚Äù, their agave iced tea. It‚Äôs a light flavor ‚Äì agave-sweet, but not too sweet ‚Äì an enjoyable step up from drinking boring ol‚Äô water from a can. Although, the water in the ice cold can is delicious, cool, and refreshing. I‚Äôve tried other drinks, but Liquid Death has been the one candidate with enough potential for a successful wholesale switch.\nLiquid Death is an interesting product to me. It‚Äôs entire brand is: water, but hardcore. As if Monster energy drinks started doing yoga and got passionate about staying hydrated. A weird blend of dad jokes and toxic masculinity applied to water. Why does water have to have skulls? Why not fill up a water bottle?\nI guess my answer for that is‚Ä¶ I have water bottles. Thousands. I can do that but let‚Äôs be honest, sipping on water bottles is boring. A water bottle or double walled tumbler can‚Äôt match the tactile thrill of snapping into a cold one‚Ä¶ mmm‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the user experience I crave. Me, a god, breaking open metal canisters with my bare hands. It‚Äôs not that sensational, but there‚Äôs a dopamine hit and selfish reward center activated in my brain.\nOne day I‚Äôll ditch the cans and move over to plain ol‚Äô sun tea or kombucha I brew in a window or closet (respectively). One habit substitution at a time though, starting with eliminating the ‚Äúpossibly carcinogenic‚Äù one.",

          "description": "From Chrome 115 you can enable Safari Web Inspector debugging for Chrome on iOS. This post explains how to get started.\nPrior to Chrome 115, debugging webpages required building Chrome for iOS from source, as the release version of WKWebView did not support remote Web Inspector debugging. In Chrome 73, we added the chrome://inspect page which locally displays JavaScript logs to assist in debugging webpages. Now that WKWebView allows Web Inspector debugging in release (as of iOS 16.4), we have added a setting in Chrome 115 to enable this feature and further improve the developer experience.\n# Getting started\nOn your iOS device you need:\niOS 16.4 or greater.\nChrome 115 or greater.\nOn your Mac you need:\nThe Safari Develop menu enabled. Enable this from Safari application settings, Advanced Settings tab.\nOn your iOS device launch the Chrome app and navigate to Settings. In Content Settings, enable Web Inspector. Relaunch Chrome for iOS after changing this setting.\n# Debugging your site\nWith the setting enabled, you can debug any page running in Chrome for iOS by following these steps.\nConnect your iOS device to a Mac with a cable.\nIn Chrome for iOS, navigate to the website which you'd like to inspect.\nOn your Mac, launch Safari. From the Develop menu, hover over the name of your connected device and select the url of the website which you would like to inspect.\nThe displayed Web Inspector window will allow debugging of the current web view. For more details about using Safari Developer Tools, refer to Apple's documentation.",

This can be a great way to keep users engaged and make your website more visually appealing.\n          \nIn the past, the only way to create scroll-driven animations was to respond to the scroll event on the main thread. This caused two major problems:\nScrolling is performed on a separate process and therefore delivers scroll events asynchronously.\nMain thread animations are subject to jank.\nThis makes creating performant scroll-driven animations that are in-sync with scrolling impossible or very difficult.\nWe are now introducing a new set of APIs to support scroll-driven animations, which you can‚Ä¶",

          "description": "Hey HackerNews!\nI'm Renat Abyasov, CEO of Wonderslide, and today I'm thrilled to share our creation with you.\nWonderslide is an AI-powered presentation design tool that saves you time and effort. Simply input your draft, and in seconds, it generates stunning, fully editable PowerPoint slides.\nA few years ago, instead of reading a book to my daughter, I found myself creating slides for meetings and conferences. \"There must be a way to automate this routine,\" I thought. Then, I met a group of like-minded people who envisioned robots creating presentations instead of humans.\nWe had little more than a dream when we were just starting ‚Äî a dream to stop wasting precious time on presentations. And now, after many countless iterations, we're finally ready to reveal our AI designer to the world.\nKey Features:\n ‚Ä¢ Automated slide layout and redesign with one click\n ‚Ä¢ ML-based image and icon matching\n ‚Ä¢ AI-powered text editing\n ‚Ä¢ Native export to .pptx\nThe AI designer seamlessly applies your content to the layout, incorporating color schemes, images, and icons, all optimized with the golden ratio in mind.\nUnder the hood, our neural networks analyze and structure different types of content, while the ChatGPT API helps highlight key points and condense text. The result is a range of slide versions for you to choose from.\nTry Wonderslide now and let us know your thoughts! Has it made creating presentations more efficient? Did it enhance the visual appeal? Is the user interface intuitive? Your feedback is invaluable as we strive to improve our service.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36775266\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "How do folks develop PCBs, firmware, host-software, maybe even ASICs and track versions of each? Can these various components be effectively tracked in a single repository? Specifically:\nThe timelines for design cycles vary greatly ‚Äì it can range from mere minutes for host software changes, builds, and tests, to hours for FPGA synthesis, and days to weeks for PCBs. ASIC development can span months to years.\nArtifacts: in software we have mostly text (we can diff), we can build quickly or cache builds or run incremental builds; none of that works in the physical world. Is it advisable to check in a mechanical or electrical engineering design project into a git repository?\nWhat do folks do, what is your experience, what works, what does not?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36629522\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 2",

A PC board is an inexpensive way to connect all the wires at once. When Steve Jobs and I started, with a blue box and then the Apple I and Apple II computers, I did the digital design, connecting hundreds of wires myself on the prototypes. Steve Jobs took the role of getting PC boards made so that we could manufacture sellable products.\nAfter a short while we had outside companies create the PC boards according to my designs. I was extremely proud of one design that far exceeded what had been done before. That was a floppy disk interface card so you could attach a disk and type ‚ÄúRun Checkbook‚Äù to run the Checkbook program, rather than finding a cassette tape labele‚Ä¶",

I think I've solved that with these special components that allow:\n- developers to build their logic using zero effort, placeholder UI\n- designers to redesign these UI's while testing their work in its final form, in the full context of the application\n- developers to accept these ready-to-go designs in a way that doesn't clutter the codebase\nI oscillate between feeling ecstatic, because I feel like I'm on the edge of finally solving the back and forth handoff problem I've often dealt with, and some light despair, because I have a very small network (no decision makers) and would struggle to get something even perfect off the ground. I'm only saying this so someone reading is encouraged to either A) let me know that this is something they want or B) bring me back to reality, and explain why I'm wasting my time.\nCheers!\n[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36291173\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36491835\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Hey folks,\nI'm super excited to announce the release of a new UI for Apache Kafka, Confluent, Redpanda and Kinesis that focuses on Teams and Data Mesh. (Note: the desktop version is also very popular with individual developers!)\nWhy is this important? Because providing a solution that can be used by both IT and business (non-technical) users is essential when building applications that process business data.\nOf course, we are mainly developers working on Kadeck. So you won't miss any of the features you need to troubleshoot and monitor Kafka and your applications. In fact, we have put a lot of effort into making Kadeck the best UI for Apache Kafka on the market. This includes enterprise features such as fine-grained rights management, topic organisation with data owners, labels and topic (API) documentation, teams and roles as well as LDAP/AD connectivity, data policies and masking, audit log and much more.\nI hope you enjoy using Kadeck - either the free version or the Professional/Enterprise version - and please let me know your feedback. I always love to hear about your specific use case!\nHave a great day,\nBen\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36486868\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Am I the only one using Thunderbird strictly as an RSS client? I've seen countless RSS clients recommended here over the years but none ever have the features to make me switch, mainly due to lacking extension support (for things like uBlock Origin and Bypass Paywalls) or privacy concerns from not running on a local Linux desktop. (I haven't heavily used the e-mail functionality in Thunderbird in over two decades. I haven't tried the Chat or any other functionality at all.)\nIs there something I'm missing out on? Is there a client with all the same features and then some that I just haven't found yet? I've looked at Feedly, Inoreader, and many others through the years but none have risen to the level of replacement. It's not broken so I'm not looking to fix it but I'm open to hearing how others manage their feeds to see if there's any possible improvements I've overlooked.\nFull disclosure: I've donated in the past to Thunderbird/Mozilla, including company matches.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36691782\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 2",

High DPI, high resolution. Not excessively blurry, or retina-like. Good color representation.\n- Single monitor setup.\n- Be able to see 3 screens side by side comfortably, with my coding screen at minimum 16px font size\n- Around 1-1.5k.\n- Can be driven by a Macbook Pro\nI am currently comparing a Dell 43\" 4K Ultrasharp screen (dell u4323qe)  vs a LG 40\" Ultrawide 5kx2k (lg 40wp95c-w). I don't have any experience using an ultrawide vs a very large screen so feedback around that decision (or recommendations of other monitors) would be very useful.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36682537\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 16",

          "description": "Has anyone here tried using an oxygen concentrator to increase their productivity?  I can get the CO2 level in my room to around 580 with a comfortable temperature, but I never feel quite as clear-headed as when I'm working outside.  I'm wondering if getting an oxygen concentrator that gets my effective CO2 level to ~400 would carry any risks or downsides that I should know about. For example, one thing I'm learning is that these machines can be loud, so I'd need to consider whether the productivity gain from increased oxygen would be offset by increased ambient noise.\nUpdate: Here are a list of things I think I'll try based on comments: 1. oxygen cylinder, 2. CO2 scrubber, 3. oxygen concentrator, 4. air exchanger.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36559258\nPoints: 24\n# Comments: 60",

          "description": "For the longest time I hated how I could not easily make HTML tables that are showing nice excel like data (i.e. they are really correctly using table, tr, and td tags for data not layout) to look good on mobile.\nI finally have a solution I love. I keep using it over and over.\nheaders := []string{\"name\", \"age\", \"species\", \"home_planet\", \"language\", \"occupation\"}\nI define the headers and call:\nc.MakeCells(list, headers, \"_welcome\")\nThe list is an array of key values pairs, and _welcome is just the name of the view.\n{{ define \"_welcome_col1\" }}\n{{ $row := index . \"row\" }}\n{{ index $row \"name\" }}\n{{ end }}\n{{ define \"_welcome_col2\" }}\n{{ $row := index . \"row\" }}\n{{ index $row \"age\" }}\n{{ end }}\netc.\nThen with tailwindcss I have:\n\n    {{ template \"_table_large\" . }}\n\n\n    {{ template \"_table_small\" . }}\n\nSo I'm rendering both the tables on the page but only 1 will show depending on the size of the screen.\nAnd the logic in _table_small is the secret to the whole thing. Instead of displaying each row horizontally, it repeats the headers vertically as col1 and then col2 is each row value.\nYou can see demo at https://many.pw/\nJust make the window smaller if you are on desktop and it will jump to the small version.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36593583\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 3",
