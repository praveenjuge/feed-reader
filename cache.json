Sometimes a small typo might elude us, sometimes we make the odd factual error despite our best efforts and research. Sometimes we phrase something clumsily, giving the wrong impression, omit some piece of information (intentionally or unintentionally), or perhaps misinterpret something we’ve read elsewhere. I’m as guilty as anyone. Especially on this blog, where I don’t always have time to proofread as thoroughly as I should. I worry a lot about being “correct”, particularly as my readership has increased over the past few years, and always endeavour to ensure my articles are as accurate as possible.

My brain is wired to remember margin and padding shorthands (top, right, bottom, left), but when it comes to corners it’s a different story. Do I start from the top left corner, or the top right? So I usually resort to the longhand, which is admittedly verbose, but at least has the advantage of being explicit, for me and any future readers of my code. For the record, these are equivalent:\ndiv {\n  border-radius: 10% 20% 30% 75%;\n}\ndiv {\n  border-top-left-radius: 10%;\n  border-top-right-radius: 20%;\n  border-bottom-right-radius: 30%;\n  border-bottom-left-radius: 75%;\n}\nIn the shorthand, we start from the top left corner, and go round clockwise, ending with the bottom left.\nIronically,…",

          "description": "I watched the documentary General Magic (mentioned in Tony Fadell’s book Build) about the 1990s Apple spin-off company General Magic that built the iPhone before the iPhone. Ultimately the product was a commercial failure, but the documentary is a wonderful look at product design and what happens when you let talented engineers roam free range. They invented USB, created capacitive touch screen GUIs, and imagined the portable “Post-PC” world before Windows 95 and the Internet were ever popular. Ultimately the product was a failure, too early for its time. How did they build this product? Well the answer is… prototypes.\nMy favorite part of the documentary is Megan Smith beaming over her cabinet full of hardware prototypes. Her focus on making something people love, an intimate device, is infectious. Her eagerness to blend everyone’s wishes with the harsh reality of available and affordable hardware shows. Starting with off-the-shelf components and inventing if necessary. When describing the product, she’s not talking about megabytes, protocols, and pixels, but talking about the sound, the feeling, the touch of the product and software in people’s hands.\nI feel more vindicated than ever that prototypes, put in people’s hands, are the biggest opportunity to capture lightning in a bottle. These people are imagining and building the iPhone 17 years before the iPhone launched. Megan Smith talks like Steve Jobs, but Steve Jobs doesn’t work at Apple or General Magic. We often herald the invention of the iPhone or Android and these magic devices as invented out of thin air or our collective science fiction, but both of those products used by billions of people rose from the ashes of General Magic’s failure. That’s a lot to dwell on. The composting of failures produces rich and fertile soil.",

Writing, code, art… all with computers nipping at the heels with competency and speed. Fascinating. Unexpected in my lifetime. A mild bit alarming, but fascinating nonetheless.\nI don’t think it’s all bad, but my brain is still ramping up to the new reality that these handicrafts have (likely) been permanently altered. We should celebrate the lower bar for creative endeavors; you no longer need to be an expert at Photoshop to produce a creative image, just an expert at generating prompts. People are extracting beautiful artifacts from these machines. Incredible.\nAs interesting a future this creates, I’m a member of an old caste of people that still believes massive gains don’t come without realized costs; or more explicitly, electricity isn’t the only cost. What if the cost we’re paying is our perception of reality itself? It’s increasingly likely that the next thing you read or watch is the product of a content extruder. Your favorite author, artist, creator, influencer, job applicant, or manager; the curtain pulled back to reveal a series of six word prompts. Rather than be left behind, I should start the augmentation process now…\nSiri, make me hotter and smarter. Send.",

          "description": "Firstly, I wish everyone a merry Christmas.\nIf you log onto Hacker News everyday, you'll notice that a lot of changes have happened in the website.\nFor starters: the navigation bar's color has changed to a slightly darker shade of red, rather than the orange background.\nThe top post numbers are now in alternating red and green colors (christmas colors).\nI couldn't have been the only one to notice, right? In the beginning I thought something was messed up - only to realize what day it was today.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34124914\nPoints: 10\n# Comments: 5",

          "description": "I like how ActivityPub can be implemented on any website and provide a good set of endpoints to enable rich, social-media-like content interactions. I'd love to enable my current website to respond to those requests, but I don't want to either use \"activitypub-express\" or install a full Mastodon (or any other) server just for myself.\nMy idea was to implement the protocol myself, which would be a nice way to learn it and its problems. But I would also love to make it a library that can be applied by others on their own, already existing websites.\nThe problem that I am having is that the current methods to implement this kind of pluggable extension involve connecting to one specific back end framework, such as creating an Express middleware.\nWhat I was thinking was:\n- Use TypeScript (to leverage the large JS community)\n- Make it as vanilla as possible\n- Use fetch standards such as the Request and Response objects, which are available natively since Node 18\n- Provide multiple adapters for common frameworks such as Express, Fastify, Next.js, Astro, etc\nIs this solved elegantly on any other language or framework?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34037748\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nDuring this year we have been building Depoxy, a tool for managing and optimizing data pipelines on AWS.\nThe main reasons for building Depoxy are:\nthe current UIs for managing data pipelines are inefficient\noptimizing data pipelines has a lot of potential both in CO2 and financial terms\nWhere is this inefficiency coming from and how much better we can get?\nThe UI and the tooling around data services are not integrated at the level it is optimal. This is the reason why having an integrated UI improves the workflows by 50% (22s vs 54s). You can check out the video we have about a simple workflow.\nHow much optimization?\nWe have 10 years experience with various clients in this space and based on the previous experiences the optimization potential is between 10 - 30% year over year infrastructure cost. This is a lot for many companies, especially nowadays.\nWhere are we with this product?\nThis is the first iteration of the product and we just got started. The next iteration is going to be metadata analytics engine for data that is stored on AWS S3. Based on the metadata we can get insight into the efficiency of the data set and provide guidance for optimizing it.\nThe second next iteration we are planning to implement a SQL parsing engine that provides automatic data lineage so that people can track how data flows through their system.\nDetailed blog post with a lot more:\nhttps://www.depoxy.dev/blog/2022-12-07-introducing-depoxy\nLet us know what you think. If you find any problems, issues (even security bugs) please let us know. Thank you in advance.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33896367\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I wrote an RSS reader called RSS Brain recently. The motivate is the current RSS readers either don't sort articles by priority, which makes it hard to read posts from HackerNews and Reddit, or sort it with some \"smart\" algorithm which I don't trust. I also like the Google News feature that can show related story from different source, but the sources are not configurable and the algorithm is not transparent either. So with RSS Brain, I implemented these features:\n* Recommend related articles from the feeds of your choice. It's backed by ElasticSearch and the algorithm is described on RSS Brain's website.\n* Option to sort articles by upvotes and time. The algorithm is similar to the old Reddit and you can find it on the website as well.\n* Save search terms into folders so you can filter the articles.\nI've been using it for a while and found these features very helpful. So I want to share this on HackerNews. The frontend is written in Flutter so it has cross platform clients, even though the web version don't feel very \"web native\" because the level of Flutter web support. I guess only time can improve that.\nI don't have enough hardware to scale it up so it's currently in subscription mode to limit the users. I'm going to open source the code (maybe non-commercial license) once I think it's ready so you can host it by yourself. It's still in early stage and haven't been tested by a lot of people. So any feedback is helpful. Thanks!\nUpdate: Added a scroll down hint in the landing page.

After weeks of trying to get support to track down this bug, we finally got this response\n\"Thank you for your patience while my team looks at this. We were able to confirm that the best time range currently to space the blog posts is 10-12 hours before Mailchimp's sending time. There just isn't enough time between your posts and the feed to pull the new content.\nAs a best practice, I would plan your content releases a day in advance with this functionality in mind.\"\nIt started with 4 hours, now they are telling us 10-12 hours in advance? My client runs a news site and sends our daily news. It's not always possible to even publish content that far in advance. It's insane to me that this functionality was working fine, for years. That they have managed to break and instead of fixing are saying just publish an insane amount of time ahead of the newsletter being sent?\nI'm not sure what it takes to get someone's attention at MailChimp to actually fix this. Read the RSS feed before sending the scheduled post. Like it used to. Otherwise, what newsletter providers would people recommend replacing MailChimp with?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34102591\nPoints: 7\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "I've came to deep realization that CSS is the most important  thing for building a website. It holds the key to becoming full stack developer or just a backend developer. It's everything in frontend.\nSooner or later, you'll need vanilla css. You can't depend on bootcrap or failwindcss. Your site looks like same if you do so. And many components aren't available there.\nThere are components like carousel, cards hover etc etc..How to polish all these skills?\nIs there a course for it?\nI try to practice it like randomly, but there are no tutorials. I'm not at a phase where I can read complex long code and  decode it.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34128451\nPoints: 10\n# Comments: 10",

That's all.\nThere are various components in a website though. I'd like to be able to build any of them whenever required if I'm in a job.\nI wanted to build a timeline using html and css but it's not entering my head at all. I've seen codes from multiple websites.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/L7c1Bkj\nThis is the timeline that I want to build. Looks pretty simple but I'm unable to build it. How do I deal with stuffs like this? How do I learn these stuffs?\nIs there a course that helps to deal with these stuffs? There's no point of having learn CSS if I can't build these stuffs with my visualization. Please guide me.\nThe scary thing here is that if I can't build these stuffs then there is 0 point of me learning css.

          "description": "Back in the day (late 90s), Microsoft had a format called \"HTML Application.\"\nIt was just an HTML page with a \".hta\" file extension. Opening such a file would open it in a chrome-less browser, and give the scripting in the page access to the file system.\nI used to love these things. I wrote a bunch of little apps in them.\nSome examples:\nhttps://medium.com/@anht_59851/html-application-hta-a-gui-for-your-scripting-on-windows-bfaacf2c3bdd\nThese still exist, but there are problems with them:\n1. Coding is a bear. They run in the mshta.exe process, and that spawns an instance of... IE9, I think? There's no \"inspect\" panel, for instance, and errors just pop a modal with no debugging information.\n2. Near as I can tell, they use an older version of ECMAScript. \"let\" doesn't seem to work, not does \"addEventListener,\" etc. I kept getting weird \"Syntax Errors\" for things that appeared to be valid, contemporary JavaScript.\n3. I'm quite sure some security software (like on my laptop, issued by employer), blocks these from executing.\nWhat's the current-day equivalent of these?  I want to write an HTML page complete with CSS and JS, double-click on it from my desktop, have it open in a browser instance of its own, and have access to the file system.\nI essentially want a way to create little GUI apps, without having to use WinForms.\nWhat am I looking for? Is it Electron?\n(Note: I'm on Windows)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34014642\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Web crawling in this day and age is loaded with caveats, and must be done carefully as to not put an unnecessary load on other people's infrastructure. I'd really like to try to make my own web search tool, so I'm trying to scope out something simple enough to get me started. Here's what I have so far.\n- I don't want to parse anything in the SimilarWeb Top 50.\n- I don't want to render JS\n- I'd like to keep a web index that is still measured in TBs\nI've done search engines for research papers in the past. The key difference was that I could collect that data very easily through a documented API. Now I need to either build or use a crawler and I'm not sure where to begin. Here are some thoughts that I have so far.\n- I'm probably going to write the crawler in Go. It seems like a good fit for this sort of software.\n- How do I start collecting lists of domains? Do I just start hitting public IPv4 addresses on Ports 80 and 443?\n- If I run something like this with proper rate limiting on a server, would Cloudflare inevitably just start blocking me?\n- If I were to run this from a machine connected to the Internet via a residential ISP, then would I get a nasty letter from my ISP?\nAny advice or feedback is appreciated. The goal of this project is to learn more about web crawling moreso than to build a product that would be sold.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33824222\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "Hey,\nin my last newsletter this year, the 13th, I want to say thank you to all of you: Thanks for being my audience, for reading my emails, and articles, sharing them, and giving me feedback. I really appreciate every single email you write to me. Happy holidays and happy new year!\nThe web is still evolving fast. The one thing I learned pretty early as a frontend-developer is that we need to constantly learn new things, explore and stay curious.

          "description": "Hey,\nWill you recognize what the icons in the following link want to explain? I thought it’s a good quiz to ask my international friends here to find out how well these icons work. Now think about using only icons for an interface again. The idea of building these icons is to reduce friction in the user interface and to clean up endless text options but what is it worth if no one knows what the symbol really means? I myself struggle a lot when apps have text links for everything but the user login / registration or account link is a symbol that’s hard to identify (is it the login, the sign up, the logout icon?).\nBetter try to clean up interfaces so the text alone works well.
