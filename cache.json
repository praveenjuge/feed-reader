          "description": "I wrote about how I created a page on The Session with instructions for installing the site to your home screen. When I said that I included screenshots on that page, I may have underplayed the effort involved. It was real faff.\nI’ve got an iPhone so generating screenshots (and video) from that wasn’t too bad. But I don’t have access to an Android phone. I found myself scouring the web for templates that I could use to mockup a screenshot of the address bar.\nThat got me thinking…\nWouldn’t it be cool if there were a service that generated those screenshots for you? You give it a URL, and it spits out screenshots of the site complete with overlays showing the installation flow on Android and iOS. It could even generate the img markup, complete with differently-scaled images for the srcset attribute.\nDownload the images. Copy that markup. Paste it into a page on your site. Boom! Now you’ve got somewhere to point your visitors to if you’d like them to install your progressive web app.\nThere are already some services out there for generating screenshots of mobile phones but they’re missing is the menu overlays for adding to home screen.\nThe devrels at both Google and Microsoft have been doing a great job of promoting progressive web apps. They’ve built tools to help you with tasks like generating icons or creating your web app manifest. It would be sooooo nifty if those tools also generated instructional screenshots for adding to home screen!",

Although I don’t play the game myself, I think it’s pretty great.\nNot only does Wordle have a very sweet backstory, but it’s also unashamedly on the web. If you want to play, you go to the URL powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle. That’s it. No need to download an app.\nThat hasn’t stopped some nefarious developers trying to trick people into downloading their clones of Wordle from app stores. App stores, which are meant to be curated and safe, are in fact filled with dodgy knock-offs and scams. Contrary to popular belief, the web is quite literally a safer bet.\nWordle has a web app manifest, which means you can add it to your home screen and it will behave just like a native app (although I don’t believe it has…",

But there was another reason why this partnership sounded good: we had the same approach to writing and sharing.\nEver since Clearleft was founded in 2005 we’ve taken on board the motto of the World Wide Web itself: let’s share what we know.

This post is for RSS subscribers only.\nRead more about RSS Club.\n\nTwitter released a feature that allows you to connect your crypto wallet to your Twitter account. Once you connect your wallet, you can set your profile picture to an NFT that you own.\nI mean… setting your profile picture (”pfp”) wasn’t a hard problem before. Right click > Save As, right? But this feature eliminates your phone’s camera roll as a middleman and instead inserts your wallet and the OpenSeas API as two third-party middlemen instead. If you’re wealthy enough to own enough NFTs that you have a hard time managing them all as profile pics, I suppose this is useful.\nOk. Whatever.

Then in the waiting room I saw an older white man with a ponytail and a Hawaiian shirt calmly strumming his ukulele.\nAgain, I reacted, “What the fuck is going on?”\nThen I caught myself. This… is… weird.\nWhy was he playing it in the doctors office? Was he a minstrel? Was he calming the souls of fellow patients?  A minister? A minister to himself? Does he just love Hawaii and goddamn it ain’t no one gonna stop him not even the cops at the doctors office?\nI think this moment struck me like a ton of bricks because it’s been awhile since I’ve encountered weird due to the pandemic. Angry? Oh, I’ve encountered plenty of angry. Hot-headed assholes losing their shit in a Chic-fil-A drive thru, yeah I’ve seen that, but been awhile since I’ve seen weird.\nThe world could use a little more weird.\nI miss weird.

          "description": "In Open UI there’s been some discussion about what default ARIA role the proposed <popupdialog> element should have, if any…\nThe proposed <popupdialog> element is a top-layer element that anchors to another element. Semantically, that’s a lot like a non-modal dialog, but people will probably use it incorrectly as a listbox, tooltip, combobox, etc. which are not a dialog and have their own more appropriate semantics. Should it be a dialog? Or should it be nothing like a <div> or a <span> but sits on the top layer of a website? Should we have other (similar) elements for those specific use cases? Is display: popup the best primitive here?\nAll good questions and I’m sure someone smarter than me will provide an answer.\nWhat struck me about it all was how ARIA wants to be specific. It asks elements “Who are you deep down in your soul?” It’s a sentry at the gate, asking elements to identify themselves and if the element belongs to or fits within the known lexicon then there are well-defined interaction patterns that work with the Assistive Technology. It’s all useful and makes sense if you consider aural interfaces.\nHTML, in my view, tends to be more general and permissive. A chill uncle. <div>? Sure, that can be a div. <article>? If you think that’s the article, great, let’s start there. <video>? Sure, send me some sources and I’ll do my best otherwise I’ll do nothing. Did you use a link for a <button> and a <button> for a link? Aww geeze, Rick. Wish you hadn’t done that. There’s right and wrong ways to do HTML, but there’s often more than one path to a solution. HTML provides a lot of building blocks, spicy divs and spicy spans, sometimes with built-in functionality and semantics, and other times the functionality it’s all bring-your-own.\nThere’s a tension there, but I think that’s what you get in a robust language designed to be liberal in what it accepts but conservative in what it does.",

Its usage in Chrome has declined\nsignificantly over the last year. SDES is\nremoved because it is a\nsecurity problem. It exposes session keys to Javascript, which means that\nentities with access to the negotiation exchange, or with the ability to subvert\nthe Javascript, can decrypt the media sent over the connection.\n# Deprecation policy\nTo keep the platform healthy, we sometimes remove APIs from the Web Platform\nwhich have run their course. There can be many reasons why we would remove an\nAPI, such as:\nThey are superseded by newer APIs.\nThey are updated to reflect changes to specifications to bring alignment and\nconsistency with other browsers.\nThey are early experiments that never came to fruition in other browsers and\nthus can increase the burden of support for web developers.\nSome of these changes will have an effect on a very small number of sites. To\nmitigate issues ahead of time, we try to give developers advanced notice so they\ncan make the required changes to keep their sites running.\nChrome currently has a process for deprecations and removals of\nAPI's,\nessentially:\nAnnounce on the\nblink-dev\nmailing list.\nSet warnings and give time scales in the Chrome DevTools Console when usage\nis detected on the page.\nWait, monitor, and then remove the feature as usage drops.\nYou can find a list of all deprecated features on chromestatus.com using the\ndeprecated filter and\nremoved features by applying the removed\nfilter.

          "description": "I am working on a side-project to learn web-development. The app is simple, with following features: account creation, creation of \"content\"(e.g. a blog post), commenting, reporting, up/down voting, bookmarking and tagging. So during the development I thought what if I treat everything in the app as \"content\" and create hierarchy of the content, and then create every entity relation in the DB as many-to-many. Naturally, lot of tables were created in the DB. But that got me thinking, that this design opens up lots of interesting use-cases such as sub-accounts, group accounts, sub-posts, multi-commenting, multi-reporting, comment-threading, group-posting etc.\nThis was a very interesting exercise. I think there will be DB performance as well as storage size issues with this design. Not sure though, never tried anything like this in practice.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30033277\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I’ve been hopping around a number of large non-FAANG enterprises for the past few years. In each, I keep observing a pattern - people seem uninterested in writing System Design / Architecture documentation.\nI struggle to grok a system if I can’t read about the context. What are the goals/antigoals? What constraints was the system built under? What big architectural choices were evaluated? (e.g Serverless vs Containers)\nDigging deeper I also see a lack of consideration for non-functional attributes like Performance, Capacity and High Availability.\nCloud paradigms can help to an extent with auto-scaling etc., but I feel there should still be a model for the expected Perf/Capacity, given the selected SW+HW stack.\nIn the case of High Availability, I continully see teams running critical Prod services without clearly documenting the expected behaviour if an Instance, AZ/Datacentre, Region or  an external dependency goes down.\nAll of these observations have been in highly regulated industries with significant tech budgets.\nSo HN:\nDo you teams document these architectural designs?\nHave I perhaps lost touch with modern practices?\nHow do you grow teams (or defend the design from Mgmt / Auditors) if this information is held in peoples heads?\nAppreciate your input and apologies as English is my second language.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30003513\nPoints: 35\n# Comments: 25",

          "description": "Over the years I've started many, many side projects and most of them were completed but never launched because I didn't like the way they looked and couldn't improve them.\nCommon advice for people like me is to use a framework and/or template. I've used bootstrap in the past which is fine for very simple apps, but I struggle with anything even remotely complicated. I've spent money on premium bootstrap themes but the end result never looks the way I imagined.\nI've also hired a couple of designers on odesk with no success. I showed them what I was working on and explained how it worked. I basically got back the same thing with different colors.\nIt's hard for me to express exactly what I find difficult. I see webapps like notion, github, basecamp etc and by comparison, my stuff just looks terrible. Has anyone here struggled with design before and what did you do about it?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29909783\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 4",

I don't intend to take a career in front-end (maybe in a decade) and just hacking away on my own small projects using external APIs. It is probably for another post but after being scared of coding for such a long time, it seems so interesting and kind of a new world (despite the frustrations obviously).\nThe thing is, I came quite late to it and learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JS whilst finally delving into React which has been... welll confusing. It generally feels like an overkill and learning new things about it not enjoyable anymore as a beginner.\nI have delved into Svelte in the past week and it just has been a completely different story. I am not associated with them, and I am not trying to promote it as I want to just ask whether React felt as frustrating as for me or am I missing something?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30046364\nPoints: 24\n# Comments: 45",

          "description": "Context: I am a full stack developer that uses React to build simple UIs for technical simulations.\nWhen working with React I spent a lot of time, also out of curiousity, on different solutions for certain problems (Think of Redux, MobX, and Recoil or React wrappers like React-Konva).\nWith Svelte I don't do that. It seems most basic functionality is included in a thin layer of abstract above HTML, CSS, and JS (ref. The truth about Svelte by Rich Harris) and the Svelte standard library. From state management, reactivity, and with SvelteKit, to SSR and code splitting. For problems not covered is was, until now, always easy to use TS/JS.\nQuestion: is Svelte lean and pragmatic or is it missing something?\nNote: I know React, use it, and like it (especially with hooks & Redux-Toolkit).\nAs I am far from senior, maybe there are some complexities I am not seeing yet.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29968005\nPoints: 14\n# Comments: 7",

I don't want someone who has already scripted and prepared all the steps for the video. Looking for something more improvisational, of course, ideally they should be experienced or produce high quality code and at least partially explain their thought process as they're doing it.\n- Preferably web dev focused - I've been trying to hone my skills with HTML / CSS / JS / TS and React mainly, but really open to anything if I think I can learn some good coding practices from it.\nAn example of a recent one I liked was: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K77xThbu66A\nHowever, I would prefer something a little less hacky than this if possible.

          "description": "Hello!\nIn the last few months I've worked on creating Codedraft, a mobile application that allows you to learn CSS. It is currently available on Android only:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codedraft\nThe main idea of the app is to learn and practice at your own speed, that's why the information is split into very small pieces. It offers two courses, CSS Basics and Advanced CSS, each of them being split into several sections.\nAnother feature of Codedraft is the ability to practice what you learn in the web app, available at https://app.codedraft.io. When learning in the mobile app, occasionally you have the option to scan a QR code on the web app - this action will automatically take you to a relevant coding exercise.\nThe web app can also be opened from the \"Scan Code\" tab in the mobile app.\nI've always wanted to work on an educational software, however this is my first dive into the domain. :) I would be very happy to get any type of feedback possible.\nLet me know if you have any questions and thanks a lot for reading!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29912852\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hi there HN.\nAamu.app is an app that I've made and I hope to get some feedback.\nIt aims to have all the most important productivity tools (for companies) in one package. It will hopefully get more of those features in time, but currently there are already quite a few – tasks, docs, video meetings and so on.\nWhy did I do it? Because I thought the current ones were not that good, and I'm talking about things like Microsoft's offering now. The different parts of their software were clumsy and they were not integrated very well into the whole – i.e. different parts were not designed in collaboration in mind.\nI realize it's quite a big app for one person to do, but let's just say that I felt I needed to do and finish it. Couldn't stop after I had started it.\n---\nHere's an url you can try it without registering into it, and the usernames/passwords:\nhttps://piper.aamu.app/\nusername: richard ... password: richard1\nusername: gilfoyle ... password: gilfoyle\nusername: bighead ... password: nbighead\nusername: dinesh ... password: xxdinesh\n---\nThe main url of the site: https://aamu.app/\nHope to get some feedback, thanks!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30019284\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 3",

For example, I read Call of the Wild, an 80(ish) page book in 4 weeks and then I read a 400 page book in 4 days… so it's really swings and roundabouts.\nI recorded 21 books on my Kindle this year, but actually one of them was read aloud to the kids (Which I do still count) but another one was all of 19 pages… which, I think really doesn't count (it was Home: Habitat, Range, Niche, Territory by Martha Wells). So… 20 books then.\nThis post is mostly data driven (from my own web site's data) to give me a sense of the quality of the books I've read, otherwise individual reviews are all linked in this post or available on my books page.",

          "description": "Lovely but I found the language almost too distracting.\nOnly right at the end of the book did I consider that maybe I really wasn't the right audience for the story - as it seemed to smack of \"millennium type problems\". Using air quotes in my description because I'm fairly sure this is a patronising statement I'm making!\nThe Dex character feels discontent with their achievements and is struggling to find fulfilling meaning. Their work has meaning to others but they're left feeling empty. Obviously it's an impossible measure as life trondles forward and achievements change with time.\nFor me it was only really when Dex meets the Robot (whose name I've already forgotten) when the book became more engaging. It was like the Dex character could be challenged and some real depth was offered (for better or worse for Dex's personality).\nBut what I did struggle with was the language and the odd shoehorning of gender pronouns. Dex is neither \"he\" or \"she\", so Chamber's settles with using the \"they\" pronoun. This led to my own confusion regularly thinking the lines I was reading was referring to Dex and another character that was in the scene.\nThe sore-thumb moment is when Dex asks, interestingly, what pronoun the Robot uses, and the Robot responds with \"it\" and it refers to itself as an object. Dex replies with (something like) they are the same, and their pronoun is \"they\". This seemed like a potentially interesting exchange between the Robot and Dex about the subject of how one refers to oneself and how they identify, but it doesn't happen. It just has that exchange, and then the story returns to what they were doing and carries on. It felt jarring and like Chamber's wanted to discuss this topic, but instead shoe horned it in.\nI do also suspect that my trouble with the language is a me-thing and probably with practice it won't cause me as much (or any) confusion, but for now, and this book, it definitely affected how I enjoyed the story.",

Most people have no idea that they have mental health issues but move on everyday just like a typical day.

According to a study, poor mental health causes about 14 percent of all deaths worldwide and increases the mortality rate by 2.2 percent compared to individuals doing well mentally. Thirty percent of all grownups experience mental health issues at some point in their lives, with the large number among this set comprising low-income earners.

However, It is true that many still aren't entirely comfortable with the idea of smoking CBD. Many people refrain from using CBD, even though it can help with their health concerns because they do not like smoking. \n\n\nThe good news is that CBD can be consumed in many different ways these days.

          "description": "Making something new takes patience. But it also takes faith. Faith that everything will work out in the end.\n\nDuring the development of most any product, there are always times when things aren’t quite right. Times when you feel like you may be going backwards a bit. Times where it’s almost there, but you can’t yet figure out why it isn’t. Times when you hate the thing today that you loved yesterday. Times when what you had in your head isn’t quite what you’re seeing in front of you. Yet. That’s when you need to have faith.\n\nThere are designs that are close, but not there yet. There are obvious conflicts that will need to be resolved. There are lingering things that confound you, confuse you, or upset you, but you know that eventually they’ll work themselves out. Eventually you’ll find the right way to do something you’ve been struggling with.\n\nIt’s hard to live with something that isn’t quite right yet – especially when it’s your job to get it right. It’s important to know when to say “it’s fine for now, but it won’t be fine for later.” Because moving forward is critical to getting somewhere. And, eventually, you’ll figure it all out. It’ll all work out in the end.\n\nThis is what I’ve always believed, and have always tried to practice. A dedicated faith in the eventual resolution of a problem, the eventual execution of a concept, and the eventual realization of the right design. Even when something’s poking out you don’t like, or something isn’t aligning quite right, or the words aren’t as elegant as you’d hoped, or something just isn’t easy enough yet, you need to have confidence it’ll all come together eventually.\n\nRemember that what you’re making is in a perpetual state of almost right up until the end. And it's never right even after.\n\nIn the meantime, you just press on and keep making things, trying things, and getting closer and closer to the time when you can tie the loose ends into a perfect bow and present it to the world. What fun it is!\n\n\n-Jason",

          "description": "The Dutch competition authorities just slapped Apple with a five million euro fine for refusing to comply with the country's new requirements on App Store policies. These new requirements are somewhat oddly contained to just dating apps, as they came as a consequence of a specific complaint from a specific provider, but even with that seriously restrictive caveat, Apple has chosen to blow them off. Because this is just the cost of doing business [crimes]!\nThe five million euro fine is the first of potentially ten such weekly fines, which will come due if Apple continues to violate the new requirements (like allowing Dutch dating apps the right to link out of app for payment). But as Daring Fireball points out, €50 million is \"spare-change-under-the-sofa\" money for Apple, a company that literally makes a billion dollars per day in revenue.\nThis is the problem with fines. They put a price on criminal behavior, and if the gains from committing those crimes exceed the cost of the fines, there's a base hyper-rational calculus that says the company should continue to break the law.\nI don't necessarily disagree with the basic incentives here. Fines should be sufficient to deter violations (and these surely are not). But I also have some sympathy with the Dutch authorities. The normal rules of commerce, competition, and regulation just don't apply when you're dealing with a trillion-dollar global behemoth like Apple. For whom a €50 million fine is chump change.\nWhat'll be curious to see now is whether Apple will embrace this calculus, and the odious cape of contempt that comes with it. Because while that might make sense in the short term, there's just no way this is the last stop. If Apple willfully decides to flip off the Dutch and their national sovereignty, I think we might just see the leviathan that is the European Union awaken.",

But now the party is over, and what used to be free will now easily cost $500/year or more (if you have 10 users on a custom domain). Yikes.\nUnsurprisingly, I'm not actually against Google charging for email. The long deep freeze of innovation in email came as a result of Google giving away free* service. (* It wasn't ever free FREE, of course, but the price in data and attention wasn't obvious to most before they got hooked.)\nThe problem is the switcheroo. When you give something away for free for years, and then suddenly show up with a demand for payment, people are rightfully going to feel like it's a stickup. Especially if they have over a decade's worth of data that's difficult to get out locked inside that box you gave them for \"free\".\nIt feels even more so if the vendor showing up with demands for payment is a monopolist like Google. Who controls the majority of all email that flows in the US. Then it very much feels like you got suckered. Oh, we were just the stepping stone for you to get the dominant marketshare, and now that you've captured it, you return for the loot? Gah.\nEmail wasn't ever free to offer. Especially not the unlimited kind with gigabytes of storage that gave Gmail its original splash. It's just that Google monetized it through data plunder (like reading your purchase receipts!), attention drains (promoted emails!), and now finally with a paid switcheroo for the most locked-in accounts.\nYou could of course also just pay with cash monies from the get go.

He focused in a relatively sober tone on the sanctity of Apple's integration and curation as arguments for why they deserved their monopoly privileges. A technical witness perhaps stretching the truth to fit the narrative needed, but at least feeling somewhat constrained by it.\nIn Arizona, Apple sent Kyle Andeer, the Chief Compliance Offer, to claim that preventing Apple from shaking down app developers for 30% would be tantamount to \"a government mandate that Apple give away the App Store\" because it would \"allow billion-dollar developers to take all of the App Store’s value for free\".

It doesn't matter what else is true about you, if your programming chops aren't up to par, there's not going to be a job offer. \nSo far, so uncontroversial, you'd think?

          "description": "The opening for director of engineering at Basecamp has barely been up for a day, and there's already an inbox full of applicants. Virtually none of whom seem to have bothered reading the basic requirements for the opening or comply with the instructions on how to make a successful application. And I'm just left thinking: What's the point? Do people think this is a lottery?\nThis isn't unique to this position, of course. We always get a large amount of applicants to openings at Basecamp who don't even seem to do the most basic work to ensure their application fits the opening. And it fascinates me, because presumably this approach must work for some people, some of the time, right? Otherwise why would you keep operating like this?\nMaybe that's part of the disillusionment with the modern job market. That applications are being processed by AI, and humans don't even see your effort, unless the computer finds the matching keywords in the CV. So why put in the effort! But is that actually true? Are lots of companies actually hiring this way? For positions like this? I'm skeptical.\nEither way, it's not how we review applications at Basecamp. There's a human on the other side, and that human is not going to spend five minutes pondering whether you might be a fit for the role, if you don't comply with the basic requirements, like including a cover letter. Or having the relevant experience required for the role (like needing experience as a \"manager of managers\" for the director of engineering).\nYou might think, what's the harm? Not like it takes a lot of effort to apply like this! Just spam the CV, and that's it. But I think there's a cost to that kind of job applications which show up in a psychological toll from a terrible applications-to-callbacks ratio. That further just worsens the feedback loop: I'm not getting callbacks, so I'll put even less effort into the next opening.\nI guess what I'm saying is make the effort or don't bother.

It could be worse, you could have died!\nIt wasn't just about physical setbacks either, but the social and mental ones too. Things inside of my control, things outside of my control.

It's closely related to negative visualization, just with a different timing. The underlying premise is the essence of Stoicism: We suffer more in our mind than in reality.
