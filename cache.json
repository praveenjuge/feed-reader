          "description": "It’s been some years since Tab Atkins-Bittner first proposed Cascading Attribute Sheets. I had a situation come up which made me think about them again and I thought I’d share.\nOn my site I have a handful of blog posts which have a title and/or text content in different languages. As someone who speaks a handful of languages, I like incorporating different languages, phrases, and untranslatable words into my day-to-day blogging. 「手答え」(tegotae) is an example of one of those words. It directly translates to “hand response” but is sometimes translated as “haptic feedback” or “game feel” when used in a video game context.\nOne problem with my use of other languages is that I’m lacking proper lang attributes on the foreign text, which makes it inaccessible. I’ve started brainstorming ways out of…",

          "description": "The YouTube gods surfaced me a video of classical guitarist Brandon Acker comparing a $200 guitar, a $2,000 guitar, a $20,000 guitar, and a $200,000 guitar. As you step up in orders of magnitude in cost, you start to see what creates value: the materials, the resonance, the sustain, the ease of playability. I’ve played guitar all my life and I never even imagined $200,000 guitars existed. I won’t spoil which one is the best but the result is shocking! Every guitarist I’ve talked to that’s seen this video had the same reaction.\ntl;dr- I would love to see someone do this with websites.\nBonus: Building a classical guitar from scratch\n\nIf you want a behind the scenes look at what goes into making a $20,000 guitar, musician and YouTuber Rob Scallon spends a week+ building a classical guitar with the same classical guitar luthier from the previous video,  Marshall Bruné. It’s a two hour video and I gobbled up every minute. Planks of wood and chunks of bone transformed through bending, shaving, sanding, gluing, and polishing; a transfiguration into a masterpiece. Incredible.\nAs mentioned in other carpentry videos I’ve watched, I love the little glimpses into the bespoke tools experts create to do their job well; the benders, the shapers, the hole cutters.

The tokens could then be redeemed for activity on other websites. Since then, we've received feedback that the name led to a misunderstanding that the API provided a signal of trust determined by the browser. The word \"trust\" has different meanings for different sites, and the website issuing the token determines the signal of trust.\nWe're renaming the Trust Token API to Private State Token API to better showcase its privacy and utility benefits.\nThe API provides a small amount of storage to allow organizations to convey information from one context (token issuance) to another (token redemption)  in a privacy-preserving manner. The tokens are designed to help protect the user's identity by using techniques such as cryptographic  blind signatures.\n# Engage and share feedback\nDemo: The Trust Tokens origin trial has closed, so the demo won't work, but you can still view code for trust token issuance and redemption.\nGitHub: Read the proposal, raise questions and follow discussion.\nW3C: Discuss industry use cases in the Antifraud Community Group.",

          "description": "From Chrome 108, the following replaced elements respect the overflow property: img, video and canvas. In earlier versions of Chrome, this property was ignored on these elements.\nThis means that an image which was earlier clipped to its content box can now draw outside those bounds if specified to do so in a style sheet. The default browser style sheet clips the overflow to the content box with the following rules:\nimg {\n  overflow: clip;\n  overflow-clip-margin: content-box;\n}\nHowever, it is possible for your stylesheet to override this behavior by setting overflow: visible. The following examples show some cases where you might now see unwanted overflow.\nThe object-fit property is used to scale the image and fill the box. If the aspect ratio does not match the box, the image will draw outside of the bounds.\nimg {\n  object-fit: cover;\n  overflow: visible;\n}\nThe border-radius property makes a square image look like a circle, but because overflow is visble the clipping no longer occurs.\nimg {\n  border-radius: 50% 50%;\n  overflow: visible;\n}\nSetting inherit: all and causing all properties to inherit, including overflow.\nimg {\n  all: inherit;\n}\n# Solution\nIf this change means you see unwanted overflow, and overriding the overflow property to visible is not intentional, inspect the CSS applied to the element via DevTools. This should allow you to identify the CSS declaration which is overriding the overflow property to visible and remove it or update it to clip.\nimg {\n    overflow: clip;\n}\nIf updating the CSS is not trivial, another fix is to add the following inline style to the element.\n<img style=\"overflow:clip !important\">",

This year, instead of hosting CDS and asking you to come to us, we're meeting you where you are in your region, at your favorite conferences and events, and on various online forums such as Twitter Spaces.

I'm pretty sure it was an article published after 2019.\nHopefully someone remembers this and can share the link with me in the comments.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33311156\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I'm working on an LED art project that combines a few realtime signals; audio and some other inputs to inform the visuals. I'm running things on an ESP32 right now and doing an FFT and some other sort of seat-of-the-pants DSP stuff on one core while the other handles bluetooth, LED control, etc. I've got some time to mess around and I'd like to get a broad strokes overview of the embedded DSP field to inform myself on where to explore next. I've got a fair bit of hands on experience but little formal training.\nUltimately the goal is to *make good art* so I'm not really looking for anything specific. In my head I'll get some good papers/textbooks/libraries/articles recommended to me and then I'll spend a few weeks to write toy implementations of whatever seems interesting in C to get a feel for the space.\nI'm particularly looking for the nitty-gritty type stuff, cool hacks that save cycles and improve latency, my goal here is visceral reactivity and I'd like to get some more tools in my toolkit that allow me to interpret and combine signals in realtime in interesting ways. Even info on cool math hacks like Carmack's fast inverse square root would be appreciated.\nP.S. Also of interest is material on debugging and modelling realtime code.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33294641\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nI've recently gone through a few interviews where I did poorly on system design questions like \"design twitter.\" The interviewers expressed a wish to see me go more in depth on technologies, but I simply don't have much experience in any of them, as my current role is heavily ML focused and issues of scaling were long-ago solved by my large employer.\nMy question is are there any recommendations for ways to get more experience on system design? For most things it'd be as simple as \"start a project revolving around X\" but for scaling.. you kind of need users first. Was wondering how to get around this problem.\nThanks\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33263962\nPoints: 19\n# Comments: 9",

          "description": "The LTE digital baseband market was famously dominated by Qualcomm, which maintained a 60+% market share for nearly a decade (2009-2019).  MediaTek also successfully entered the market, but not for high end phones for high-income markets (U.S., Europe, etc.). Famously, both Intel and Broadcom (two semiconductor firms known for their ability to design successful chips in other markets, e.g., MPUs, cable modem chips, WiFi chips, Bluetooth chips, etc.) attempted to enter the market and failed. Broadcom exited the market and wound down their LTE business unit. Intel sold its group to Apple, which now has gone on to fail to develop a 5g digital baseband solution (Apple continues to use Qualcomm for its 5g digital baseband solution).\nWhy (from an engineering perspective) is it so difficult to develop an advanced  LTE (or 5G) digital baseband chip such that even semiconductor powerhouses like Intel and Broadcom have struggled to develop solutions which compare to Qualcomm's offerings?\nNote - answers from semiconductor design engineers appreciated :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33197429\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nMy friend tries to land her first job as UX. She had a maternity break from work, was working as buildings designer before. I can see she is slowly descending into depression since she gets rejected without being given feedback. Most recently she has gone through a series of interviews with the company, got to the final stage and was rejected- without any feedback. And this after investing her time into preparing assignments and taking tests...\nI try to coach her out from depressive thoughts she is getting, but it's not really helping. If I was running a company I would take her onboard, she wants to be UX but I think she would do whatever the current need would be to provide value.\nDo you know of anyone looking to get junior UX? Any advice would be of great value to her, thanks in advance!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33140493\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "Aside from a foundational understanding of database operations I really lack the proper knowledge to make proper design descisions for my databases and aplications that interact with those databases. There arent many people at my company that are particularly wise when it comes to this topic and it feels like we are really missing out on some really simple improvements just because we are oblivious to them.\nAre there any recommedations for essential reading or proper practice guides for improving database skills? I'm reading 'Database Internals' by Alex Petrov and its really interesting so far but not so practically applicable for me at the moment. It would be great to hear any resources that made a real impact on how you went about working with databases.\nI'm mainly interested in SQL databases but resources on no-SQL would be welcome too.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33118819\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 3",

It illustrated 5-6 different dimensions which one might optimize for (e.g. charging speed, capacity, cost, lifetime, etc) on these little charts which looked a bit like spiders' webs.\nI thought that was a great resource, but didn't save it at the time.  Anyone know what I'm talking about or have a link? Thanks!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33059097\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

You then get one RSS feed which combines all releases into one stream.\nCreating multiple streams that combine by topic, programming language or whatever would be great too.\nDoes something like this exist? Or something similar? I know that Github offers feeds for single projects, but it feels tedious to add like 50+ single feeds to the reader.\nThanks for any tips!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33209227\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

A standalone desktop app is coming soon.\nHappy to hear any feedback and answer any questions!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33183781\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

Every morning you decide what you will do and what you will not do by swiping away objectives and only keeping ones you want to focus on for the day. Throughout the day you can mark items as complete and check on what objectives remain.\nI built Nodu to use myself (and to get my feet wet with SwiftUI). After reaching a V1, I decided to release it to the public.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33081253\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

As a developer, I've never liked it.\nReact and Tailwind made it an infinitely better experience for me, but something was still missing.

At the same time, I felt lost with No-code editors because they are made for designers not developers.\nI've written about it extensively here: https://rogovoy.me/blog/writing-html-sucks\nImpulse is my experiment to bridge that gap and make a \"design\" tool that works directly with my code.\nWith Impulse, I've come to love web design (again?).\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33007344\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",
