Big meetings of more than 50 people will get shoehorned into a six-hour window on Thursdays, with a limit of one a week.\nThis is fascinating to me.  I get the desire to remove bloated meetings, but there are recurring meetings that I find genuinely valuable to have sync (project standups / staff meetings).  Curious if this ends up being a long term policy for Shopify or more of a culture reset.",

So I usually resort to the longhand, which is admittedly verbose, but at least has the advantage of being explicit, for me and any future readers of my code. For the record, these are equivalent:\ndiv {\n  border-radius: 10% 20% 30% 75%;\n}\ndiv {\n  border-top-left-radius: 10%;\n  border-top-right-radius: 20%;\n  border-bottom-right-radius: 30%;\n  border-bottom-left-radius: 75%;\n}\nIn the shorthand, we start from the top left corner, and go round clockwise, ending with the bottom left.\nIronically,…",

I think I’ve boiled those posts down to some major themes from the past year.\nMy new job at Luro\n\nThe biggest change this past year is my employment, I’m working full-time on Luro. What began as a side project app has grown into it’s own little stealth startup. And when I say startup, I mean startup. Over the course of the last year, we took a bit of pre-seed investment, made our first hires, re-architected the app, and onboarded our first round of private beta users.\nThere have been ups and downs starting a SaaS business in the head…",

          "description": "I watched the documentary General Magic (mentioned in Tony Fadell’s book Build) about the 1990s Apple spin-off company General Magic that built the iPhone before the iPhone. Ultimately the product was a commercial failure, but the documentary is a wonderful look at product design and what happens when you let talented engineers roam free range. They invented USB, created capacitive touch screen GUIs, and imagined the portable “Post-PC” world before Windows 95 and the Internet were ever popular. Ultimately the product was a failure, too early for its time. How did they build this product? Well the answer is… prototypes.\nMy favorite part of the documentary is Megan Smith beaming over her cabinet full of hardware prototypes. Her focus on making something people love, an intimate device, is infectious. Her eagerness to blend everyone’s wishes with the harsh reality of available and affordable hardware shows. Starting with off-the-shelf components and inventing if necessary. When describing the product, she’s not talking about megabytes, protocols, and pixels, but talking about the sound, the feeling, the touch of the product and software in people’s hands.\nI feel more vindicated than ever that prototypes, put in people’s hands, are the biggest opportunity to capture lightning in a bottle. These people are imagining and building the iPhone 17 years before the iPhone launched. Megan Smith talks like Steve Jobs, but Steve Jobs doesn’t work at Apple or General Magic. We often herald the invention of the iPhone or Android and these magic devices as invented out of thin air or our collective science fiction, but both of those products used by billions of people rose from the ashes of General Magic’s failure. That’s a lot to dwell on. The composting of failures produces rich and fertile soil.",

Writing, code, art… all with computers nipping at the heels with competency and speed. Fascinating. Unexpected in my lifetime. A mild bit alarming, but fascinating nonetheless.\nI don’t think it’s all bad, but my brain is still ramping up to the new reality that these handicrafts have (likely) been permanently altered. We should celebrate the lower bar for creative endeavors; you no longer need to be an expert at Photoshop to produce a creative image, just an expert at generating prompts. People are extracting beautiful artifacts from these machines. Incredible.\nAs interesting a future this creates, I’m a member of an old caste of people that still believes massive gains don’t come without realized costs; or more explicitly, electricity isn’t the only cost. What if the cost we’re paying is our perception of reality itself? It’s increasingly likely that the next thing you read or watch is the product of a content extruder. Your favorite author, artist, creator, influencer, job applicant, or manager; the curtain pulled back to reveal a series of six word prompts.

          "description": "As seen with things like open source software, many developer tools, Hacker News as a website and people's opinions on CSS and modern web design on places like Reddit?\nCause it feels like many people's tastes come from the 80s/early 90s, with the idea that any sort of visual flourish or attempt at readability is completely irrelevant.\nAnd it makes me wonder why this is. Why do so many... hacker type individuals seem to prefer very brutalist, utilitarian designs over anything more fancy? Where did this preference for plain text at the expense of all else come from anyway?\nBecause I don't think this happens quite as much in other fields, like architecture, cooking or construction.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34246340\nPoints: 35\n# Comments: 78",

          "description": "Firstly, I wish everyone a merry Christmas.\nIf you log onto Hacker News everyday, you'll notice that a lot of changes have happened in the website.\nFor starters: the navigation bar's color has changed to a slightly darker shade of red, rather than the orange background.\nThe top post numbers are now in alternating red and green colors (christmas colors).\nI couldn't have been the only one to notice, right? In the beginning I thought something was messed up - only to realize what day it was today.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34124914\nPoints: 10\n# Comments: 5",

          "description": "I like how ActivityPub can be implemented on any website and provide a good set of endpoints to enable rich, social-media-like content interactions. I'd love to enable my current website to respond to those requests, but I don't want to either use \"activitypub-express\" or install a full Mastodon (or any other) server just for myself.\nMy idea was to implement the protocol myself, which would be a nice way to learn it and its problems. But I would also love to make it a library that can be applied by others on their own, already existing websites.\nThe problem that I am having is that the current methods to implement this kind of pluggable extension involve connecting to one specific back end framework, such as creating an Express middleware.\nWhat I was thinking was:\n- Use TypeScript (to leverage the large JS community)\n- Make it as vanilla as possible\n- Use fetch standards such as the Request and Response objects, which are available natively since Node 18\n- Provide multiple adapters for common frameworks such as Express, Fastify, Next.js, Astro, etc\nIs this solved elegantly on any other language or framework?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34037748\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nDuring this year we have been building Depoxy, a tool for managing and optimizing data pipelines on AWS.\nThe main reasons for building Depoxy are:\nthe current UIs for managing data pipelines are inefficient\noptimizing data pipelines has a lot of potential both in CO2 and financial terms\nWhere is this inefficiency coming from and how much better we can get?\nThe UI and the tooling around data services are not integrated at the level it is optimal. This is the reason why having an integrated UI improves the workflows by 50% (22s vs 54s). You can check out the video we have about a simple workflow.\nHow much optimization?\nWe have 10 years experience with various clients in this space and based on the previous experiences the optimization potential is between 10 - 30% year over year infrastructure cost. This is a lot for many companies, especially nowadays.\nWhere are we with this product?\nThis is the first iteration of the product and we just got started. The next iteration is going to be metadata analytics engine for data that is stored on AWS S3. Based on the metadata we can get insight into the efficiency of the data set and provide guidance for optimizing it.\nThe second next iteration we are planning to implement a SQL parsing engine that provides automatic data lineage so that people can track how data flows through their system.\nDetailed blog post with a lot more:\nhttps://www.depoxy.dev/blog/2022-12-07-introducing-depoxy\nLet us know what you think. If you find any problems, issues (even security bugs) please let us know. Thank you in advance.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33896367\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I wrote an RSS reader called RSS Brain recently. The motivate is the current RSS readers either don't sort articles by priority, which makes it hard to read posts from HackerNews and Reddit, or sort it with some \"smart\" algorithm which I don't trust. I also like the Google News feature that can show related story from different source, but the sources are not configurable and the algorithm is not transparent either. So with RSS Brain, I implemented these features:\n* Recommend related articles from the feeds of your choice. It's backed by ElasticSearch and the algorithm is described on RSS Brain's website.\n* Option to sort articles by upvotes and time. The algorithm is similar to the old Reddit and you can find it on the website as well.\n* Save search terms into folders so you can filter the articles.\nI've been using it for a while and found these features very helpful. So I want to share this on HackerNews. The frontend is written in Flutter so it has cross platform clients, even though the web version don't feel very \"web native\" because the level of Flutter web support. I guess only time can improve that.\nI don't have enough hardware to scale it up so it's currently in subscription mode to limit the users. I'm going to open source the code (maybe non-commercial license) once I think it's ready so you can host it by yourself. It's still in early stage and haven't been tested by a lot of people. So any feedback is helpful. Thanks!\nUpdate: Added a scroll down hint in the landing page. Thanks for the feedback.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34188734\nPoints: 66\n# Comments: 52",

After weeks of trying to get support to track down this bug, we finally got this response\n\"Thank you for your patience while my team looks at this. We were able to confirm that the best time range currently to space the blog posts is 10-12 hours before Mailchimp's sending time. There just isn't enough time between your posts and the feed to pull the new content.\nAs a best practice, I would plan your content releases a day in advance with this functionality in mind.\"\nIt started with 4 hours, now they are telling us 10-12 hours in advance? My client runs a news site and sends our daily news. It's not always possible to even publish content that far in advance. It's insane to me that this functionality was working fine, for years. That they have managed to break and instead of fixing are saying just publish an insane amount of time ahead of the newsletter being sent?\nI'm not sure what it takes to get someone's attention at MailChimp to actually fix this. Read the RSS feed before sending the scheduled post. Like it used to. Otherwise, what newsletter providers would people recommend replacing MailChimp with?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34102591\nPoints: 7\n# Comments: 1",

And was amazed at how many word/phrase origins I had searched for that I couldn't even remember searching for.\nThe problem was that it was very very slow. I didn't expect Notepad++ to choke on such a large file, but it did.

And many components aren't available there.\nThere are components like carousel, cards hover etc etc..How to polish all these skills?\nIs there a course for it?\nI try to practice it like randomly, but there are no tutorials.

I'd like to be able to build any of them whenever required if I'm in a job.\nI wanted to build a timeline using html and css but it's not entering my head at all. I've seen codes from multiple websites.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/L7c1Bkj\nThis is the timeline that I want to build. Looks pretty simple but I'm unable to build it. How do I deal with stuffs like this? How do I learn these stuffs?\nIs there a course that helps to deal with these stuffs? There's no point of having learn CSS if I can't build these stuffs with my visualization. Please guide me.\nThe scary thing here is that if I can't build these stuffs then there is 0 point of me learning css.

          "description": "Back in the day (late 90s), Microsoft had a format called \"HTML Application.\"\nIt was just an HTML page with a \".hta\" file extension. Opening such a file would open it in a chrome-less browser, and give the scripting in the page access to the file system.\nI used to love these things. I wrote a bunch of little apps in them.\nSome examples:\nhttps://medium.com/@anht_59851/html-application-hta-a-gui-for-your-scripting-on-windows-bfaacf2c3bdd\nThese still exist, but there are problems with them:\n1. Coding is a bear. They run in the mshta.exe process, and that spawns an instance of... IE9, I think? There's no \"inspect\" panel, for instance, and errors just pop a modal with no debugging information.\n2. Near as I can tell, they use an older version of ECMAScript. \"let\" doesn't seem to work, not does \"addEventListener,\" etc. I kept getting weird \"Syntax Errors\" for things that appeared to be valid, contemporary JavaScript.\n3. I'm quite sure some security software (like on my laptop, issued by employer), blocks these from executing.\nWhat's the current-day equivalent of these?  I want to write an HTML page complete with CSS and JS, double-click on it from my desktop, have it open in a browser instance of its own, and have access to the file system.\nI essentially want a way to create little GUI apps, without having to use WinForms.\nWhat am I looking for? Is it Electron?\n(Note: I'm on Windows)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34014642\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",
