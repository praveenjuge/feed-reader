When used selectively and sparingly it can be a great way to help resources that the browser won’t discover in the HTML itself—a background image referenced in CSS, a JavaScript file injected by a script loader, etc—arrive much earlier.\nUnfortunately, like anything, it can also be misused and the consequen…",

I never felt attracted to these tools even though thousands of developers had success with them. I’m not sure why I never jumped in, but I’m sure verbosity and/or tooling fatigue played a part. Ultimately, I ended up settling on my own SMACSS/BEM hybrid that’s more of a .block--variant .generic {}  pattern with some global utilities mixed in.\nI’m not anti-BEM nor anti-roboclasses, but as we enter a new era for CSS I think we have an opportunity to rethink best practices aro…",

That’s almost one Netflix… to have tab completion!? $10/month for copy-pasta from StackOverflow? No way, José.\nOn the other hand, if you asked me, “For ~$100/year, I can make coding a little easier.

It needs to pull calendar data or images from an API and render it so that customers always sees a latest monthly calendar.\nI once thought of contacting one of those manufacturer of the Photo Frames and ask them if they can do the necessary tweaks. But I'm not sure what details to give them.\nWhat is the prep work necessary for this? I've absolutely no idea where to start but it's one of the project ideas that I come back to again and again and want to get it done no matter what.\nWhere do I even start at this? Any pointers would help tremendously.\nThanks HN.\n[1] https://dakboard.com/site\n[2] https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Picture-Storage-Auto-Rotate-Remotely/dp/B09GF3HYM8\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32661398\nPoints: 7\n# Comments: 2",

Visio is a general-purpose diagram-drawing application, so it cannot do that, but it has always supported linking and embedding, so in theory it could be used for this purpose by a specialized software design tool.

This refresh brings a sticky filter bar so you can scroll and see what filters are applied, a more compact navbar, and improved UX for comparing instances.\nI've also fixed numerous long standing UI bugs including: comparisons now load correctly on RDS and ElastiCache, sort by max ENI works, sort by RDS instance storage works, and all dropdowns have consistent behavior.\nFor maintainers and contributors, all the frontend libraries are upgraded to their latest versions, https://github.com/vantage-sh/ec2instances.info. Going forward, we are aware that the homepage size is quite large and have plans to address this.\nWe have tried to be good stewards of this project and evolve it carefully.

          "description": "Hey there..\nI have started writing a book on software design/architecture that provides a different perspective than existing books out there. The thesis of the book is that \"code is for humans\". The book explains how to write code that is optimal for our primitive monkey brains. The book describes how many of the best practices in software stem from deficiencies in our cognitive abilities. It expands on best practices such as (DRY, SSOT, etc) and brings new ideas on what is good code and how to write it.\nI am looking for someone to partner with on this book as it's a huge project and I would love to be able to split the work.\nI have written a rough outline and filled in about 40 pages of notes, examples and text. The project is still very much in it's infancy.\nA bit about me: I worked as the software architect of a 100+ person team at Mobileye/Intel and have many, many years of experience working on a variety of software from self driving cars to web apps.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32562332\nPoints: 26\n# Comments: 18",

          "description": "By seriously I mean both the theory and the practical. The theory of how to actually design and analyse algorithms. And also implement them in a language. The language shouldn't matter while thinking about algorithms.\nAt the moment I am not opting for something like leetcode. I want something that teach me the principles of how to actually design from the fundamentals.\nAlso I want to be as much language agnostic as possible. By that I mean the ability to think about algorithmic solutions to problems in terms of mental models that I can then translate to a low level language like C, or a dynamic imperative language like Python, or a functional language like Racket, SML or OCaml. Of course, the assumption here is that I must know the language I want to implement the algorithm in. So basically I want to learn about algorithms in a paradigm agnostic way so that I can implement them in any paradigm I want.\nHow to go about this? Do you have any book or course suggestions in mind?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32540102\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 3",

          "description": "I'm at the point where I am starting to write shaders to do custom effects in WebGL,  such as combining a left and a right image to make an anaglyph image.\nWhat I'm thinking about next is about how to make \"game like\" UIs on the web for desktop and mobile.  Some things that I am inspired by are:\n(1) The Playstation 3 interface https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XrossMediaBar\n(2) Interfaces in video games for viewing a database or documentation about the game world.  I'd like to make something similar but for some part of the real world.\nThe Pokédex from Pokémon is a familiar example but it's not such a good one because Pokémon games mostly run on low-spec handhelds,  so I am thinking more about what you'd see on a PC or TV console games...  But instead of using a game controller you'd be using the touchscreen,  mouse or keyboard.\n(3) However I very much like how games for the Nintendo DS/3DS use the touchscreen such as peeling stickers in Paper Mario Sticker Star and how you can make Luigi fight in the boss battles in Mario and Luigi Dream Team.  So some advanced capability for touch gestures is wanted.\nI'd prefer programming in Javascript,  could accept Typescript but it would be a hard sell if it (say) compiled something else to WebAssembly unless that came with awesome capabilities.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32442496\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Howdy HN! Been working on a side project of mine for about a year called Gloutir. It's essentially an 'agency of one' design and development service using a subscription or retainer model for billing (Stripe + Memberstack).\nI primarily focus on WordPress and Webflow design and development as I realized long ago that there's a huge demand for these services  in the design / marketing agency space.\nI've had a lot of success the past year with this work, and surprisingly (or unsurprisingly) every single client of mine has been a larger agency needing additional help. That kind of makes sense because an agency can immediately see the value in what I offer without really having to be convinced.\nRecently I've introduced a weekly option for clients looking to launch fast and spend less ($1,000 a week, maybe not sustainable but we’ll see). I'd love to get more involved with startups needing landing page work / design services.\nThere are a number of people doing stuff like this, but I do want to clarify that this is never going to be an \"unlimited design\" style subscription service. I've intentionally set a hard cap on the number of clients because it's simply impossible to accommodate more than a certain number of clients while keeping the quality of work where it needs to be.\nAnywho, curious what you all think and if you have any suggestions on how to improve.\nhttps://gloutir.com/\nAbout me: full time designer and developer at an agency. Can see more of my work at https://zchry.org.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32440171\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "Hi! Genie Builder is a free VSCode plugin that makes it easy to build web GUIs for Julia applications (and in future, Python apps too). Users can simply drag & drop UI elements to create interactive dashboards and data apps, without writing any frontend code.\nThe tool is designed for data scientists and researchers who need to expose their data models to business users with an interactive web application, but lack the software development skills to build one.\nGenie Builder completely eliminates the need to learn frontend development to code the UI. And very soon, we’re also going to support one-click cloud deployments to make it easy to build AND deploy data apps - no frontend nor devops skills required.\nI’m Adrian, the creator of the open-source Genie web framework (https://genieframework.com/). Genie offers low-code libraries for building data applications - just like Streamlit or Dash, but for JuliaLang. We developed Genie Builder because of feedback from our open source community who needs more productive data tooling.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32355012\nPoints: 30\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "So, recently i started giving out interviews. I have 7+ years of experience so one or two design rounds are expected. \nKeeping that in mind i revised my concepts on distributed system and read few famous papers on distributed system. it was fun visiting those concepts again.\nAlso, as advised i watched few scaling videos on youtube (i.e Design Uber etc.)\nI have experience building system from scratch and depending upon the requirement i have scaled few services in my organization.\nSo, my expectations from the design round was to have open-ended discussion with interviewer on certain component and discussing drill-down component architecture, scaling issues, drawbacks etc.\nBut For me at least, reality is quite different. I was asked to design BookMyShow ( Movie booking system ) in full. I mean the interviewers expectation was to just draw the components, write the api and design schema. He will understand my work by looking into it.\nI have given 5+ interviews as of now ( got offer from some of them). But i feel like design round wasn't justified.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32353046\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "Who do you talk to when you have architectural questions? Where do you get feedback on design options? When you want to discuss tradeoffs of those options who do you talk that over with?\nI am one of two technical cofounders for a small software company. We have really good discussions about the design of our product. I am pretty good at searching. We are comfortable weighing alternatives and making a decision and living with the consequences. All that said, sometimes I want to discuss with other people some of the design challenges we face, or seek input on how people have approached the problem.\nAre there fora that you enjoy for such discussion? It seems that it does not fit with the theme of most Q&A sites. Most IRC channels I know of are pretty focused on their own specific topic.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32331825\nPoints: 148\n# Comments: 101",

          "description": "Hello HN !\nI'm the founder of https://symfoz.com which is basically a RSS aggregator that allows people to partition the content they want to see in dedicated spaces called \"Playlists\", thus reducing the time needed to find the information they need.\nWhy Symfoz instead of other RSS aggregators ?\n- Create playlists of content, avoid mixing too many feeds in the same place. You know where everything is.\n- Follow people or playlists, people can create some playlists with AWESOME content, you may benefit from it.\n- We handle classic RSS feeds, but also Youtube channels, Twitter feeds, Spotify Podcasts, sub-reddits.\n- An easy UI interface (This is still WIP, UI is very hard haha)\n- Promote retention of information by allowing people to take notes (not highlighting but really take notes), instead of just consuming content and forget it. You'll be able to find your notes easily.\nA bit more about the project (you can skip this!), this is a side project that I've been working on for almost a year.\nI'm a back-end developer and the stack runs in Python. If you'd like more details, please feel free to ask, I'll be glad to answer !\nThanks for taking the time to read this, feel free to give any feedback, I would be really grateful :) !\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32622866\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

Ones that display feeds by what all users of an instance follow and feeds among multiple instances of this platform design.\nHow the main feed ranking works\nEvery user has their own personal subscription list of RSS feeds. Obviously by default they can view their own feeds like any old traditional reader. …",

          "description": "Productivity timers needed to be triggered manually before each task, Making it a chore by itself, Often leading to us not using them after a while and They don't take health into consideration.\nHealth timers are intrusive, Even then they are not always accurate and They don't take productivity into consideration.\nButt Mover addresses those problems by using a butt trigger for automatically starting the productivity timer when we sit on the chair before our workstation and a break timer which reminds us to take a walk automatically when we get up.\nButt Mover also incentivizes its usage through a Game. When the health(tasks/breaks) reaches zero its game over.\nI've been iterating different forms of Butt Mover over past two years and released the web application earlier this year(After feedback from several HN users). Today I'm making the core application open-source as I've committed myself to make the Health & Education applications I build open-source.\nI hope you'd use Butt Mover for yourself and build Butt Trigger for others to improve productivity and health. Feedback and contributions to improve the project is appreciated.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32346878\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hoping the collective wisdom of HN can help me with this one:\nI'm currently archiving a site for a client which was built in WordPress [I know! I know!] by creating a static version from it. So I've used `curl` to download the entire site and spent a few days stripping out the tangled mess of WordPress cruft.\nNext in my sites is the CSS. I've consolidated the eleventy billion CSS files strewn throughout WP into one central CSS file, which is about 3000 lines long. And now need to strip out all the unused selectors... of which I suspect there are many, because the site is mostly just plain text articles with occasional illustrations. No fancy-schmancy stuff at all.\nPlenty of advice on the web about using Chrome Dev tools to check for unused CSS against a single page. But this is a site of 500+ pages, so I need something that will crawl the entire project and compile a list of all the CSS used/unused across the entire site.\nOn the face of it this seems like one of those horribly repetitive tasks which would be a nightmare for a human to do, but trivial for a computer. A solution wouldn't even need to automagically strip the CSS out. Even just marking the used elements would allow me to see what was required or not and manually delete the rest. Pseudo-code-ually:\n  for HTML file in project \n  look for class=XXX or id=#YYY\n  look through project CSS file for .XXX or #YYY\n  insert comment /*this is used in file ZZZ.html*/\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32530595\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

What started as a question of whether we could do it somehow morphed into whether we could do without so many of the seemingly needless complications rampant in our respective industries. My wife thus did all the art as traditional frame-by-frame animation (no puppets or tweening) and I preceded without a game engine. I did use a pre-processor that gives JS a Lisp syntax (Parenscript), because C-syntax is gross. We hope the end result, while definitely of small scope, will serve to inspire some thought as to what is and isn't needed in your next project.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32517495\nPoints: 15\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Recently I was reading about fluid simulation and stumbled upon the Gauss Seidel method. I got interested in how it works and made a program that visualizes the method in action.\nI had the idea of making an interactive book-like thing for a while, so took this as a chance to do just that.\nNote that touch input doesn't work and the layout is targeted towards bigger screens, so it doesn't function properly on mobile.\nIt was fun to make and I wanted to share it. Maybe someone will find it useful. Corrections and feedback are welcome.\nTechnical Stuff\n- A single 1.7MB HTML file with embedded JavaScript and WebAssembly. You can save this single file and double click it to run.\n- A math typesetter from scratch in C that compiles/renders the equations in real-time (uses KaTex fonts and STB true type to rasterize the fonts).\n- Platform code is done using Sokol (tested on windows and web).\n- The UI is done using Dear ImGui (Most of the code is done in C++ to use ImGui without a wrapper except for the equations compiler).\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32371246\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",
