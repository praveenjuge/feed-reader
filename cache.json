          "description": "If you’ve been writing CSS for any length of time, the chances are you’ll have come across situations where you need to hide some text visually, but still have that text available to assistive technologies (such as screenreaders). Icon buttons and skip links are just two examples. (There are plenty more.) Simply using display: none hides text from assistive technologies, which is not useful to us in this scenario. So developers over the years have come up with clever ways to hide text visually, which usually manifest as a utility class that gets copied and pasted into every project, often called .visually-hidden or .sr-only — something like:\n.sr-only {\n  border: 0 !important;\n  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px) !important;\n  -webkit-clip-path: inset(50%) !important;\n  clip-path: inset(50%) !important;\n  height: 1px !important;\n  overflow: hidden !important;\n  margin: -1px !important;\n  padding: 0 !important;\n  position: absolute !important;\n  width: 1px !important;\n  white-space: nowrap !important;\n}\nIt’s so common that even popular CSS frameworks like Tailwind come with built-in .sr-only classes.\nBut as Ben Myers points out in this excellent article on why the web needs this as a native feature, there are problems with this. One issue is that there are many variations on this snippet, which have been found to cause problems as browsers and have evolved over time. Ben argues that it’s about time this became a native feature, and I absolutely agree. In the article, Ben outlines some of the advantages and drawbacks to the various forms this might take, such as a value of the display property, a property all of its own, or a HTML attribute. I recommend giving it a read, and hopefully something will come out of it 🙂\nRead the article →",

Clicking on this brings up a colour picker — handy for trying out different colour options in the browser. For the color property, this colour picker also shows the contrast ratio of the text colour compared to the colour beneath (either the element’s background colour, or the background colour of an element beneath). It turns out Chrome has a very similar feature too.

When he says “we should make a game”, he means “me” because despite a lot encouragement from his parents he hasn’t shown interest in coding classes. I also have a lot going on with the whole “starting a company” deal, so I was hesitant to pick up another big project… but he’s persistent and I’ve been in the mood to make a video game.\nWe sat down one evening to write out a game design document. After capturing the who, the what, the when, the where, and the “how it’s fun” we had a rough idea for an open world 3D game that was like Breath of the Wild but Link is a dog and it has online co-op.\n\nA summary of our scope document:\nWho: Dog and Cat\nWhat: Walk around in a 3D open world, get weapons to fight bad guys, find items and easter eggs, so…",

It dawned on us how our hobbies (hers tennis, mine gunpla) are so specialized we either A) have the stuff we need or B) our needs are so specific or subjective that even gifting a ballpark guess of what the person wants doesn’t actually help and would probably create more work.\nSungWon Cho (aka, ProZD) sums the situation up perfectly in his short bit “before and after you discover the subreddit for a hobby”…\n\nThe Reddit-ification of hobbies is real. Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok are waiting to rapture you and radicalize your innocent hobbies. And the more niche your needs become, the more expensive as well. The internet has obliterated the $20 casual gift. It’s $400+ or GTFO.\nSo we text each other links of an exact item, the stock counts of rare item across 20 sites, the exact time window the of the group buy, but ugchk, you’d need my login so that it’s tied to my account, so how about you just Venmo me $400 instead from our shared bank account?\nWe’ve cut the sails of gift giving. Online wishlists try to meet this need, but are always out of date, so you need to nudge the person to update their wishlist, spoiling the surprise, so that you can buy the first item at the top that meets your budget.\nAnd the immediacy of Amazon Prime has ruined the suspense of gift giving. Why wait a month for something when I could have it in two days with free returns? The idea of a gift giving holiday reeks of an old world activity like reeling film through a projector to watch a movie with no sound. The immense effort for a demonstrative show of attention on a pre-planned day.\nSo that’s my take, the internet has ruined gift giving. The only safe gift going forward is homemade bread from your pandemic bread hobby. But be sure the yeast is single-sourced and stored at precisely 45ºF like its hometown in the mountains of Bavaria.",

I got in the house and let out a sigh “What am I doing?!” I wish I could say this was an isolated event, but it happens often. The likelihood I do any of these activities beyond my iPad is miniscule.\nCarrying that pile of distractions, my brain flashed back to college.

Apart from Google, project partners include Microsoft, Intel, Samsung, and others. The project enables amazing web applications like Photoshop by exposing the capabilities of the underlying operating systems to the web platform, while maintaining user security, privacy, trust, and other core tenets of the web.\nBut what are examples of apps that make use of these capabilities? Our answer to this question is the Project Fugu API Showcase. It is sourced by community submissions, and contains a filterable list of apps that make use of one or more of the Fugu APIs.\nPropose missing apps to the showcase by submitting them via an anonymous form. Submissions are reviewed regularly and the showcase will be updated accordingly.\nAfter living in an embedded iframe that didn't really allow the showcase to fully shine, we have now worked on migrating it to a new home, and have polished its look and feel a fair bit, too. Find the Project Fugu API Showcase at its new location developer.chrome.com/fugu-showcase!\nLaunch each app by clicking its name, screenshot, or the Launch app link. For many apps, you can also see the source code by clicking View source. On browsers that support the Web Share API, click Share app to do exactly that. As a special inception Easter egg, the Project Fugu API Showcase is of course contained in the Project Fugu API Showcase.\nBe sure to subscribe to the RSS feed so you never miss a new Fugu app.",

These APIs make it possible to use local fonts to create fallback font faces that closely or exactly match the dimensions of a web font. This reduces or eliminates layout shifts caused by font swapping.\nIf you’d prefer to skip reading this article, these are some of the tools that you can use to start using these APIs immediately:\nFramework tools:\n@next/font: Starting in Next 13, next/font automatically uses font metric overrides and size-adjust to provide matching font fallbacks.\n@nuxtjs/fontaine: Starting in Nuxt 3, you can use nuxt/fontaine to automatically generate and insert matching font fallbacks into the stylesheets used by your Nuxt app.\nNon…",

However, it seems like more and more people are using no-code tools and templates to quickly create websites without the need for any specialized knowledge.\nSo, is learning web design still worth it in 2023?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35023234\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 4",

          "description": "Hi HN! We just released the public alpha version of Mathesar (https://mathesar.org/, code: https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar).\nMathesar is an open source tool that provides a spreadsheet-like interface to a PostgreSQL database.\nI was originally inspired by wanting to build something like Dabble DB. I was in awe of their user experience for working with relational data. There’s plenty of “relational spreadsheet” software out there, but I haven’t been able to find anything with a comparable UX since Twitter shut Dabble DB down.\nWe're a non-profit project. The core team is based out of a US 501(c)(3).\nFeatures:\n* Built on Postgres: Connect to an existing Postgres database or set one up from scratch.\n* Utilizes Postgres Features:  Mathesar’s UI uses Postgres features. e.g. \"Links\" in the UI are foreign keys in the database.\n* Set up Data Models: Easily create and update Postgres schemas and tables.\n* Data Entry: Use our spreadsheet-like interface to view, create, update, and delete table records.\n* Data Explorer: Use our Data Explorer to build queries without knowing anything about SQL or joins.\n* Schema Migrations: Transfer columns between tables in two clicks in the UI.\n* Custom Data Types:: Custom data types for emails and URLs (more coming soon), validated at the database level.\nLinks:\nCODE: https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar\nLIVE DEMO: https://demo.mathesar.org/\nDOCS: https://docs.mathesar.org/\nCOMMUNITY: https://wiki.mathesar.org/en/community\nWEBSITE: https:/mathesar.org/\nSPONSOR US: https://github.com/sponsors/centerofci or https://opencollective.com/mathesar\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34999774\nPoints: 132\n# Comments: 32",

          "description": "I wrote a simple site that uses the HN API to save new submissions. Even if they're deleted on Hacker News, they'll be saved on hLog. It looks for new posts every 3 minutes.\nIt also has a basic search that looks at the title, url and submission text (if any).\nIt's not optimised in terms of pagination of results (nor the actual page content). If you press \"Search\" without anything in the search box, you'll get a list of all the records in the database. There are around 4,200 right now.\nI wrote it in Python (Django) using SQLite3. It runs on a free VPS hosted on Oracle Cloud. I wrote this mainly to improve my understanding of Django. I'm mainly a backend guy but i want to build some frontend skills and i thought a project like this would allow me to learn that.\nAny feedback would be much appreciated, even if it's negative. I know there are hundreds (if not thousands) of HN mirrors/clones out there, but this is for my learning. If you could suggest any improvements, i may be able to learn new things i otherwise wouldn't have.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34964104\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hey, guys. I've just made a plugin which turns your pandas dataframe into a tableau-style component. It allows you to explore the dataframe with easy drag-and-drop UI.\nYou can use PyGWalker in Jupyter, Google Colab, or even Kaggle Notebook to easily explore your data and generate interactive visualizations.\nPyGWalker (pronounced like \"Pig Walker\", just for fun) is named as an abbreviation of \"Python binding of Graphic Walker\".\nHere are some links to check it out:\nThe Github Repo: https://github.com/Kanaries/pygwalker\nUse PyGWalker in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/asmdef/pygwalker-test\nFeedback and suggestions are appreciated! Please feel free to try it out and let me know what you think. Thanks for your support!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34869244\nPoints: 371\n# Comments: 32",

          "description": "Hi HN. I've been working on a new browser-based design tool that's ready for you to try.\nThe idea is you work on your design in low fidelity wireframes, while still getting a high fidelity output that you can share or use as a reference for your implementation. The way it works is by mapping low fidelity blocks you draw into high fidelity design system & React components.\nI spent several years working on design tools at companies like Airbnb, and I think the ideas behind many of the tools we built for designing at scale could really help startups and small teams as well. I would love any feedback you have!\nPS: Most of Noya is open source at https://github.com/noya-app/noya\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34848583\nPoints: 125\n# Comments: 43",

I've kept my hand in with products like Adobe XD and Figma, however I'm curious to know what HN considers the go to tools are these days?\nI have a fairly large job on my hands, the application has grown a little wild over the years, so need to bring it all into order.\nAppreciate any advice you may have.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34816584\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

Like a macro recorder in excel.\nI'm thinking like a browser extension then I can set a test scenario like this is for product checkout. Then I will click 'record test' then I will proceed to do a manual test in checkout page until completion. Then I will stop 'record test' and save it. \nOfcourse it would be great If I can set predefined parameters for input.\nI will add those recorded tests in our ci/cd pipeline and done.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34777863\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "Is there an (easy|simple|sane) [pick one from 3] way to automate animation tests that include User Interaction?\nI ask because earlier this evening I deployed an update/NPM version bump of my Canvas library, after spending much of the day reviewing all the demo tests in various browsers on various devices. Only to watch as the new version broke the library's associated website's build tools. A stupid bug (2 chars) which meant having to fix it, test essential demos in various browsers etc before doing another release on GitHub and publishing the new version on NPM.\nI know this process can be easier. But the thing that holds me back from automating the heck out of my test/release process is that I'm clueless about how to test the library's functionality. It's a library to make working with 2D Canvas elements \"more fun\", so I test manually because I need to *see* that things - in particular animations - are working as I expect them to work.\nThe test suite is here: https://scrawl-v8.rikweb.org.uk/demo/index.html\nAny advice is really welcome!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34767180\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

Scrapers are deployed on VMs, launching scrapy crawler instances dynamically based on feed SLA data in the db; there is no “scheduler”, but rather long-running parent coordinators launching child subprocesses as needed, so SLAs (and other attributes) can be modified by site admins without touching spiders\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34746972\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hey HN,\nI’d like to introduce, our app, Mockup - the ideal design tool for sketching and creating blueprints for apps or web designs.\nOne of my end goals is to make the design process easy and intuitive and that's exactly what Mockup does with its 45+ templates, flexible canvas, Library to save your elements, and a range of other attributes. With features like the Lasso tool, text and image insertion, 4000 symbols from Apple's SF Symbols library, and a customizable grid, your design possibilities are endless.\nAnd, the best part? I've just released a brand new update, packed with features suggested by our users to make the design experience even better like arrange objects, copy & paste, and an enhanced toolbar. Not to mention, users can now publish their elements to the community and access elements created by others as well as create UI  for TV apps with the highly requested newly added TV template.\nI can't wait for you to try it out!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34741935\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Lately I have been learning Jetpack Compose (for Android). Its new and shiny, like its counterpart SwiftUI (Apple), but there are older frameworks that take this approach, like React.\nThe main problem being solved, according to the marketing materials, is that its easier to keep state in sync with UI by regenerating the UI as state changes. Lots of work goes into avoiding updating the tree of UI that hasn't changed. This sounds good.\nIs the declarative approach the way forward for all 2d UIs (even outside mobile)? Is there still merit with the older approach of stateful widget trees and mutating their state imperatively? Where will we see the traditional (imperative) way maintain its niche compared to declarative UIs?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34712664\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "The Zone is the state where you are completely focused and fully productive. It takes time to get there, but the slightest distraction can knock you out of it and you have to start over.\nSo I built this app to track productivity and measure the impact of interruptions.\nThis is how it can help:\n• Launching the app and starting to get in the Zone is a commitment to work. It can prevent you from procrastinating and is a good motivator to actually start working and to keep distractions away.\n• The timer can help you decide if it’s a good time to take a pause because you’ve been in the Zone for a long period, or if it is better to continue working because you’ve just entered the Zone.\n• Your colleagues will notice the color change from yellow to red. This is a great signal that helps them understand the impact of interruptions on your productivity.\n• Statistics help you measure your daily productive time.\n• Using your phone for other purposes is considered an interruption by the app, so that’s already one distraction taken care of.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35010752\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 2",

Maybe you own your own business (whichever kind), or doing research in grad school, or some other thing where there is no external force to structure out your day.\nHow do you maintain productivity and get things done? How do you not wander off the internet rabbit hole? I am not talking about toxic patterns like studying 12 hrs a day and live streaming it. I am talking about getting real work done by working in a sane way.\nSuppose you have taken a year break to prepare for some entrance exam and are self studying subjects on your own.

          "description": "What:\nFeedgrid is a news aggregator for RSS and Atom feeds.\nIt lets you organize your feeds into related topics and view feed items in 2-dimensional grids, rather than a single infinite scroll column.\nThe goal is to have a highly configurable tool to organize diverse feeds in a visual way, and then easily check for new content with a bird's eye view.\nWhy:\n- there’s a lot of stuff on the web, but you want it in 1 place, organized by categories that make sense to you\n- RSS is nice in principle but most readers feel like an overloaded email inbox (i.e. kinda stressful—you already have other inboxes to deal with..)\n- you like breadth-first search rather than depth-first search when you’re on the john and looking for some infotainment, but TikTok is frenetic and unsettling to you because you still like reading\nHow:\n- we’re running a Django app with some minimal js in the frontend, and serve grid pages as a modest-sized html blob with enough content for one sitting, and offer old-school pagination to get more content\n- the backend web scraping is entirely separate from the server, and uses scrapy. Scrapers are deployed on VMs, launching scrapy crawler instances dynamically based on feed SLA data in the db; there is no “scheduler”, but rather long-running parent coordinators launching child subprocesses as needed, so SLAs (and other attributes) can be modified by site admins without touching spiders\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34746972\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

Google Trends shows that searches for 'git rebase' have gone up over the last 12 months (https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=git%20rebase). Quite significantly as compared to the year prior.\nIt's a crude metric and probably actually measures activity vs productivity.

          "description": "Building UI used to be fun when there were limited choices. You would use bootstrap and sass/less  or css modules, and just get things done.\nNow there are just so many options to choose from and such a feeling of FOMO.\nEach new one that comes out and moves up the rankings (https://2022.stateofcss.com/en-US/css-in-js/) makes me feel a need to evaluate it. There is always a little benefit from each new framework but then it also can make other things harder.\nI really just want nice pre-built components to use.\nTailwind has great components and templates, but its such a mess too look at when you want to deal with dynamic styles, and is slow to compile with webpack and tricky with monorepos, and then you have to use things like twind, twin.macro, windicss.\nI miss the days of jquery + sass so badly. It was so straightforward. Nested css for everything and then when you need complex stuff: just use jquery to add/remove styles.\nEvery single new framework has so many edge cases that just wear you down. Styled Components and Emotion seemed so great, but just so many freaking edge cases, and perf issues.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35039964\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 3",

          "description": "So I'm doing some web scraping in Rust, and so I will need to parse HTML. [scraper](https://docs.rs/scraper/latest/scraper/) (which uses [html5ever](https://github.com/servo/html5ever)) is doing fine except that it's the bottleneck of my application.\nSo I need a faster parser. I've tried [tl](https://docs.rs/tl/latest/tl/) which would've been perfect except that it doesn't actually work on the HTML I have. When I try to `query_selector` the elements I need, it returns nothing.\n[Kuchiki](https://docs.rs/kuchiki/latest/kuchiki/) is abandonded.\nI couldn't figure out how to get [lol-html](https://github.com/cloudflare/lol-html) to work for me (it's designed for re-writing HTML, whatever that means). It doesn't seem to have an API to extract the inner text of an element.\n[html5gum](https://github.com/untitaker/html5gum) seems to be just an HTML tokenizer, or otherwise just too low-level. I have not yet tried [quick-xml](https://github.com/tafia/quick-xml/) but judging from the README, it's pretty low-level too. I mean, if these are the only options left then I will try them. Otherwise, I would love to use a parser that's faster but as ergonomic as `scraper` or `tl`.\nAt this point, I would be happy with an Lxml bridge/port of some sort. I don't need to mutate HTML, just parse and read data from it.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34914897\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "I have used rudimentary scrapers for years but always found that the process of training them doesn’t scale as well as I expect. In a scenario where one needs hundreds of scrapers all grabbing the same five or 10 pieces of information (dates, names, addresses, and ID numbers) is it possible to just grab the raw HTML and train an NLP model to find the relevant data rather than selecting specific selectors/paths?\nIt seems to me that finding these items in an HTML doc would be a trivial task for NLP and this would allow us to forgo scraper maintenance in the event that websites change. Assuming that I already have hundreds of thousands or millions of records in structured data that could be used for training, would modern tools make this a more efficient way of ingesting data?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34755877\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "I'm a web developer who has been in the market for a new job for a while now.  As someone who has never enjoyed working with frontend JS frameworks (yes, I sucked it up and learned them and have worked with them professionally) I'm wondering who all the companies are who have embraced the semi-recent \"HTML over the wire\" movement (Can you imagine... using hyper text transfer protocol for transferring hyper text?  Seems nuts, I know).  It's a massive slog shifting through endless React/Vue/etc-focused jobs out there.  Even if you use React in small areas where it pulls its weight but generally try and stick to simplicity of sending plain ol' HTML, I'd love to know who you are.  Even if you aren't hiring, it's nice knowing you're out there fighting the good fight :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34744348\nPoints: 106\n# Comments: 139",

It’s quite interesting how the web continues to bring new stuff each week, how developers explore these new things. A lot of the CSS features we currently get make using CSS easier, make a property’s purpose clearer and some reduce selector complexity (always a good goal). Other ones enable complete new product ideas, especially in the JavaScript API field, and others disrupt the current status quo of building web apps (Page Transitions API, SPAs and MPAs).\nFor a short time, I’ll be changing my usual monthly publishing routine. The current issue started with over seventy links that are worth including. So I’ll start with a smaller list and you will likely get the next edition next week already. Whe…",

This can occur if either\n 1. you did not perform an installation before running the script (e.g. `npm install`) or\n 2. your cache path is incorrectly configured (which is: /opt/buildhome/.cache/puppeteer).\nFor (2), check out our guide on configuring puppeteer at https://pptr.dev/guides/configuration.\nWith Puppeteer 19, the Chromium download has been moved to a new folder: ~/.cache/puppeteer (on Netlify this is /opt/buildhome/.cache/puppeteer/).\nThe problem here is that Puppeteer only downloads Chromium when it is installed and the folder it downloads to is outside of the expected and previously working folders that Netlify persists across builds (like node_modules).\nThe solution here is to either move this Chromium download folder to a location that does get persisted (via PUPPETEER_CACHE_DIR environment variable or a puppeteer.config.cjs config file) or persist it yourself via a Netlify build plugin.\nI chose the latter. The netlify-plugin-cache build plugin will probably do this for you, but its so few lines of code that I used my own:\nExpand to see the keep-data-cache Netlify build plugin\n// speedlify/plugins/keep-data-cache/index.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  async onPreBuild({ utils }) {\n    await utils.cache.restore('/opt/buildhome/.cache/puppeteer/');\n  },\n  async onPostBuild({ utils }) {\n    await utils.cache.save('/opt/buildhome/.cache/puppeteer/');\n  }\n};\nwhich is referenced in my netlify.toml:\n# netlify.toml\n[[plugins]]\npackage = \"./plugins/keep-data-cache\"\nYou can see this in action on the speedlify project.\nAfter applying this change, make sure you force Netlify to reinstall your node_modules by clearing the build cache or changing a dependency version in your package.json.",
