But regardless of the outcomes, we web developers should be aware of the ecological impact of our profession, and start examining our work through the lens of sustainability. So it seems timely to share…",

          "description": "In the course of my work I sometimes find myself needing to mock API requests — often when I’m prototyping, or testing a concept for an article. There are a couple of useful (free) tools I reach for on these occasions.\nn:point\nn:point provides lightweight, publicly accessible API endpoints for your JSON data. It’s super easy to use: simply give it some JSON and it sets up an endpoint in seconds. No messing about with access tokens, it’s ideal if you just want to fetch some data. You can also define and lock the JSON schema. I’m using n:point for a Codrops article on creating an interactive line graph based on timeseries data.\nMockeroo\nIf you need to actually generate some data, Mockeroo is a tool that enables you to do just that. You can add rows of different types and Mockeroo will generate random data. There are configuration options, including setting ranges (for numbers and dates, for example), and including null values. If you’re happy writing Ruby, you can also include formulas and you can download the data in different formats.\nI’ve only used Mockeroo for generating JSON, but you can also create API endpoints. It’s not as quick as n:point to set up, but looks useful if you need to mock any more complex API requests.",

I love this video because it reminds me of simpler times where we watched idle videos on the internet all day instead of the staring in abject horror at the endless timeline. A single man knocking down a silo, what a metaphor for our current times! The silo falling also reminds me of an old Texan-ism by former Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn:\nAny jackass can kick a barn down, but it took a carpenter to build it.\nNow we are barn-less. Silo-less. Wandering open pastures for the next watering hole.\nWherever you end up I want to offer an idea; you are the value. Your ideas, your insights, your compassion, your ability to help someone in need, your dumb puns and dank memes; that’s what’s valuable. This situation has me th…",

          "description": "In recent weeks, a handful of people asked me what’s been happening in Web Components Land. Well, as President of Web Components, I have good news and the state of Web Components is pretty strong right now.\nI did my Frontend Masters course on Web Components in April and since then there’s even more positive momentum happening in the Web Components space. Here’s a high-level list of developments over the last 6 months or so:\nAccording to the 2022 Jamstack Survey “Web Components have arrived” (jamstack.org)\nBrad Frost talks about web components (bradfrost.com)\nSafari is prototyping Declarative Shadow DOM (github.com)\nElement Internals is under development in Safari (github.com)\nWebkit turned on Constructable/Adopted Stylesheets (github.com)\nEleventy introduced WebC … which isn’t capital-”WC” Web Components, but shares a similar ethos\nEnhance.dev is a whole framework built on web components\nWeb Components Community Group collected their list of top concerns for TPAC\nExciting times. When I filmed my course, these more advanced Web Component concepts (Declarative Shadow DOM, Element Internals, Adopted Stylesheets, etc) were a smidge depressing to talk about because of their unknown Safari status. I could say the technology existed, but provide no roadmap for when it would get better support. But, if I’m reading these standards positions right, hopefully the consumer branch of Safari will support them soon.\nOn top of more feature support, more tooling is also great news for Web Components. Alternate takes, different ideas, varied perspectives! While it can cause some confusion when navigating the Web Component waters, the more perspectives the better for these little building blocks.\nWatch my Frontend Masters Course",

Almost everyone pitches in to make it special for the hundreds of kids that take to our streets. A genuine piece of Americana.\nThere’s been a bit of sporting going on in October. Otis wrapped up his fall baseball season. Otis’ team didn’t have the greatest season but I think learning the lesson “not all seasons are bangers” is a good lesson. I did scorekeeping for the team which is not too difficult, but its one of those jobs no one volunteers for. It requires some sustained hyper focus to keep track of everything and mark it down in a bespoke spreadsheet.\nWe went to the Austin FC conference semifinals and I got to see the club win.

I had encapsulated myself in a micro-hoarder situation in the shed which made it difficult to get focused. Clutter, as I’m learning, is adversarial to my distractible brain. One task that’s been looming over my head was this box of file folders.\nThis box of file folders was a collection of all expenses and tax documents from the years 2012-2016. And I mean everything. Every gas, electric, internet, and credit card bill that came to my house. Every business expense. Every health expense. Every mortgage payment. The reason I hoarded all these documents? Self-employment. All those numbers factor into my tax bill every year, so I kept every physical document that was relevant. America glamorizes starting your own bus…",

          "description": "I've listened to SID music on and off since the 80s, and mostly from early games and demos. Lately, I have explored more recent music. There are online lists of peoples favorite SID music, and online players, see [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]. Because I have different tastes, I had the motivation to make my own list and UX. So from january 2020 to september 2022, I listened through the HVSC having over 50k songs, resulting in a list of 600-700 favorites. I put together a UX so I can easily access them. This project is mostly for my own enjoyment, but I guess that many others here would also enjoy it. Please let me know if you have suggestions for songs I should reconsider adding, or some feedback on the UX.\n[1] Show HN: Online SID-Player with spectrum viewer (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6750701)\n[2] High Voltage SID Collection – Commodore 64 music for the masses (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28184104)\n[3] Dial-a-Sid (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27735256)\n[4] The Sid Collection (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32368634)\n[5] WebGL SID-emulator in C++ compiled to JavaScript with Emscripten (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7270025)\n[6] DeepSID: online SID (Commodore 64 music) player (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17055344)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33637292\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hey all. I don't know how many designers are here, but I'm currently in a bit of a pickle and would like some advice.\nI am a recent college graduate that has been trusted with running the design team at a startup. I've been hired as a full-time UX designer and am currently leading a team of three design interns. I have no real experience running a design team, and am wondering how I should best proceed in managing the team. Things have been pretty disorganized, and we recently had a meeting in which most of our time was spent in pretty unproductive disagreement. As the person who is more or less running the design team I feel totally responsible for this, and would like to know how I could best run meetings and assign tasks in order to generate lots of ideas, while making sure discussion stays productive come decision making time. I'd also appreciate any tips on how to facilitate healthy discussion when discussing differences in opinions. I'm really new to all of this and a bit out of my element, but I really want to do my best and would appreciate any advice.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33616047\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 3",

We've recently hired a new development team, and I'd like to learn more technical skills in order to really understand the development side of the product, as well as to communicate ideas better and to understand our design constraints. I have a little bit of coding experience from school and am using some online tools to learn CSS/HTML/Javascript. I'm also using some online resources to learn about software architecture. Is this the best way to go about this? What would be some good resources for me to learn this skills?

          "description": "Hi, I’m the technical founder of OneGen. I've been a software engineer for over a decade, but it wasn't until the pandemic that I decided to take a leap of faith and build an innovative solution to designing data models.\nMost applications & SDKs support more than one platform. And for each platform, software engineers write and maintain the same (or similar) data models.\nI thought that if I could design data models completely independent of a database or a programming language in a way that allows versioning and collaboration and then generate the model code for whatever the technology stack is, it would be pretty cool.\nOneGen doesn't work as a one-time code generator. Instead, you design and continuously maintain your data models right inside the app to achieve a single source of truth.\nWe're excited to announce our free beta release to you.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33533340\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

The goal is to make interior design easy and fun, like playing with Lego.\nIt started off as an app to simulate housing in an MMORPG, since the furniture system there was atrocious. I'm now trying to adapt it as a simulator for general interior design.\nLike many 3D design software, there are a bunch of tools and controls, and first-time users may feel somewhat lost. So I've made a starting tutorial to help ease users into the controls. Do you think the tutorial works well?\nLet me know what else can be improved!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33468495\nPoints: 14\n# Comments: 5",

The backend is in place, but I'm not quite comfortable with the UI part. I need to build a UI that is responsive. Are there any recommended drap/drop UI builders that can export the required HTML/CSS that I can just shove into my existing rails app?\nSites like wordpress will allow me to create a UI and some backend but it is a new backend that I'll need to learn. I'd rather keep the backend as rails as I'm comfortable with it, so it'll be faster for me to build on it.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33461488\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "So much talk about Twitter alternatives in recent days, including people migrating to Mastodon and even Jack Dorsey announcing his new decentralized social media platform.\nI was thinking, if I was to build a new micro-blogging aka Twitter alternative, what technological choices would I make to get it quickly off the ground but allow for scale?\nWhat database technology or approach would you go for?\nWould you build a (mobile first) web application first or would you start straight away with a native iOS/Android app (maybe Flutter)?\nWould you go for a centralised or decentralized approach? If the latter, how would you decentralize it without sacrificing the \"public town square\" effect that Twitter currently has but is clearly lacking with the fragmentation of Mastodon?\nTo answer my own question, I would probably build a centralized platform like Twitter is now, probably opt for a fast NoSQL database like Google's Firestore in Datastore mode and to keep things simple I would probably even make sure that tweets would get automatically deleted after some years as I don't think it's needed to build a forever growing database of people's thoughts in that moment that persists for decades to come. Micro-blogging always felt to me as a thing right now, a thought in this moment but that thought could be different in a few days, months and definitely a few years, so why store it forever. Feels like I could save a huge operational cost and prevent abuse by not keeping tweets for beyond their relevancy.\nWhat are your thoughts?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33419574\nPoints: 137\n# Comments: 311",

I've been using atomics but as the complexity grows it becomes hard to review code for \"correctness\". My goal is to avoid holding locks for long periods of time. Since this is a realtime application I also want to avoid waiting. So lock-free, wait-free is preferred.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33390423\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "If you like me have many events during the day, you are probably also tired by constant switching to Mac Calendar or Google Calendar just to check when the next event starts. I searched for a widget that would show me upcoming events in some \"always visible\" way, but all apps showed the schedule in a separate window. So I decided to make a new app that would show a schedule right in a Dock icon.\nMore to this, My Upcoming Events shows a countdown in the same Dock icon several minutes before the start of the event, which is handy for me, so I can start right on time.\nLimitations: MacOS, Google Calendar only.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33371373\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "My news diet consists of the following:\n* email newsletters (substack)\n* selected articles (a lot from Hackernews)\n* I also subscribe to some promotional newsletters (events, certain products). Not sure how I would fit these\nHowever, I have been struggling with keeping my inbox clean and readable with the newsletters and am considering to switch to an RSS reader. I have several criteria:\n1. I need to be able to add one-off articles to the reader (such as finding an interesting article on Hackernews for later consumption).\n2. I would love to be able to add rules. For example, if I don't read an article for several days, I would like it to disappear from my inbox (archived) or be marked as read so it doesn't clog my reading.\n3. Needs to be accessible on computer (web/app) and  mobile (ideally via app).\nWould love to hear how other people manage this. I'm also happy to pay for a good solution here.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33613354\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 8",

Not only this, they also change the status on Discord, Slack, Telegram and many other apps.\nThis is a Growth Hack for them but this was very frustrating for me to know and especially they don't have any authority over my WhatsApp Status.\nWhen I did some reverse engineering, I found SideKick is adding an extension that injects content script on web.whatsapp.com and it changes the WhatsApp status automatically every 3 days or so and then they also send the analytics events to their servers.\nThey may/may not be doing anything with my data but the bigger question is when people over Internet are using browsers like these, they get full access to what you browse and everything else like Cookies, Passwords, etc.\nEven they can stitch your sessions in Incognito if they want in the backend \\_(~_~)_/. Who knows.\nBrowser extensions are still vetted by respective vendors like Google & Mozilla but how do we ensure we are browsing the Internet safely?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33606176\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 2",

I started on this with [html2notion](https://github.com/Jeadie/html2notion), but it turned out to be alot of work.\nWith Notion already having a [Notion web clipper](https://www.notion.so/web-clipper), I was wondering if it was worth implementing? Personally I read a small fraction of the blog posts from my RSS feed, and I like the spare page to take notes. For me, notion-rss solves the one core problem I have, acquiring and filtering high quality RSS feeds.

          "description": "I'm fairly new to the field and relatively late to the party (because I'm old), but a recurring theme that I'm noticing in my current company (which is a small startup) is how the faster you deliver the better you look to the CEO and even CTO's eyes.\nIn hour fairly infrequent meetings other engineers have raised the point that we should start valuing code quality and proper testing to our codebase, only to be met with arguments such as \"the customer doesn't pay for good code\".\nFurthermore, most likely an anecdotal bias and nothing else but I want to mention it: Online elitism revolves around shipping speed too. Comments like \"I can build X in Y hours\", \"I can skim the docs and build what I want with Z library in less than a day\", and so on.\nHow does everyone feel about it? Maybe it's just me but it feels weird. It's kinda like everyone I mentioned feels like there are no trade-offs to be concerned in regards to speed over quality or people decided that there's no reason to bother ourselves with contemplating what we're trading off speed with. Also, I feel that because quality is subjective and perfect is the enemy of done, people rely on objective metrics like \"time taken\".\nIs there truth and merit to this observation?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33394730\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

The basic idea is that you connect your Twitter account and receive a unique RSS feed that gives you all the links that would show up in your Twitter timeline. I mostly built it for myself but given all the Twitter drama, I figure there are people out there like me who want to escape the commentary, but still value the links people share.\nPlease give it a try!

          "description": "Coming from WPF and Winform, I find web development to be unnecessarily complex, but I refuse to believe that’s true.\nI just want to make a simple web app, no React, Angular or any of that. That can’t be too hard right? I’m sure in large scale, that stuff has its place, but I don’t need it. To me, the browser is the UI framework.\nWhen I Google around to get started, I find obnoxious Medium articles. I don’t want to copy and paste instructions and throw something together without a clue what’s going on. Mozilla has good documentation, but I don’t know what’s a good source to actually get a web app running locally that I can eventually deploy online. Do I really need Node? Compared to WPF/Winform this is a mess, or so I hope not.\nI want to make a simple app where users can create and fill out a form. ATC test plans, to be exact.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33635218\nPoints: 170\n# Comments: 166",

          "description": "I'm scraping information regarding civil servants' calendars. This is all public, text-only information. I'd like to keep a copy of the raw HTML files I'm scraping for historical purposes, and also in case there's a bug and I need to re-run the scrapers.\nThis sounds like a great usage for a forward proxy like Squid or Apache Traffic Server. However, I couldn't find in their docs a way to both:\n* Keep a permanent history of the cached pages\n* Access old versions of the cached pages (think Wayback Machine)\nDoes anyone know if this is possible? I could potentially mirror the pages using wget or httrack, but a forward cache is a better solution as the caching process is driven by the scraper itself.\nThanks!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33563016\nPoints: 23\n# Comments: 16",

It's especially well suited to try out changes quickly, but I've built most of the landing page with the help of the extension itself.\nYou can try it out in the landing page itself (no need to install anything).\nFeatures:\n- Click on any class (eg: px-4) and try out other values easily.\n-  Preview the website in responsive mode and quickly toggle between breakpoints. auto detects breakpoints set in the config.\n- Quickly try out new variants. Supports arbitrary variants too.\n- Lets you try out arbitrary and negative property values.\n- Add, remove or re-order elements.\n- Edit element attributes and text nodes\netc.\nI'm excited to share it here and would love to hear your feedback and suggestions.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33534806\nPoints: 7\n# Comments: 0",

It’s nice to see how web development evolves, cross-browser support is great for most of the things and we can focus on building great experiences. The result is for example Mastodon, a communication service built on web standard protocols, independent of big tech companies. Or Pixelfed, or PHP, the language that drives most of our server software. Web Components finally get some traction as more and more vendors of widgets build libraries around it. Thanks to all who help the web standards evolving, who help other people by creating open source solutions, to those who write how-to-use articles and to those who share them. Enjoy this week…",
