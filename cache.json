The reasoning goes that many web applications are intentionally built more like native apps than like websites, prioritizing efficiency during lengthy browsing sessions after the web app is already open rather than optimizing for a first visit.\nWhile I would argue that site delivery optimizations should not need to conflict with post-load optimizations (...and wonder if users carry their low performance expectations of native app startup time over to the web anyway), it is true that these represent different moments in user experience and need to be measured differently.

When JS reliance is minimal, fixing poor delivery performance can be as simple as instructing the browser to load certain scripts at a lower priority and allow HTML content to render sooner. But when a site is dependent on JavaScript for generating its HTML content in the first place, those sorts of optimizations can’t help, and in those cases fixing the problem may require deep and time-consuming architectural changes.\nWhile it has been around longer, the pa…",

It was interesting to hear about the challenges of measuring the carbon emissions of a website, and the many different aspects that must be considered while doing so.\nAsim pointed out that offsets are not an effective way of getting to Net-Zero, which might seem controversial to some, given that many companies that claim to be carbon neutral are at least partly counting carbon offsetting towards that goal.

Cruising through the archives, I found a translation of a 1989 issue of BEEP magazine which features one of my favorite sources of inspiration: Shigeru Miyamoto, creator of Mario.\nWhen asked “What’s the secret to success in the game industry?” he had this to say:\nWell, what’s worked for me so far is finding something I want to make that matches up with what the market currently needs.\nIf you believe in your idea, and that it’s something people will want, then all that remains is for you to polish and raise it to a sufficient level of quality. So no matter how talented of a staff you’ve been blessed with, if you don’t have a clear direction for your idea, I don’t think a good game will come out of it. The goal is for each staff member, individually, to contribute to the overall “finish” of the work, so it’s just a matter of having each person fulfill their role. And as the lead creator, even if the rest of the staff sometimes loses sight of the whole picture, it’s your job to hold the course and make sure you keep to that initial vision.\nUnfortunately I’ve seen it happen many times where the developers get carried away with themselves, and they’re having a really good time, but it ends up harming the playability of the finished game.\nAny time Miyamoto-san talks about “games” I map this to “websites” in my head. I’m endlessly inspired. These three short paragraphs contain multitudes.\nFind something you want to make that matches up with something the market currently needs.\nPolish and raise your idea to a sufficient level of quality.\nYou need clear direction for your idea, even with a talented staff.\nThe goal is for each staff member to contribute.\nIt’s your job to hold the course and keep to the initial vision.\nDevelopers getting carried away ends up harming the end product\nAll of these.

          "description": "From Chrome 108, the following replaced elements respect the overflow property: img, video and canvas. In earlier versions of Chrome, this property was ignored on these elements.\nThis means that an image which was earlier clipped to its content box can now draw outside those bounds if specified to do so in a style sheet. The default browser style sheet clips the overflow to the content box with the following rules:\nimg {\n  overflow: clip;\n  overflow-clip-margin: content-box;\n}\nHowever, it is possible for your stylesheet to override this behavior by setting overflow: visible. The following examples show some cases where you might now see unwanted overflow.\nThe object-fit property is used to scale the image and fill the box. If the aspect ratio does not match the box, the image will draw outside of the bounds.\nimg {\n  object-fit: cover;\n  overflow: visible;\n}\nThe border-radius property makes a square image look like a circle, but because overflow is visble the clipping no longer occurs.\nimg {\n  border-radius: 50% 50%;\n  overflow: visible;\n}\nSetting inherit: all and causing all properties to inherit, including overflow.\nimg {\n  all: inherit;\n}\n# Solution\nIf this change means you see unwanted overflow, and overriding the overflow property to visible is not intentional, inspect the CSS applied to the element via DevTools. This should allow you to identify the CSS declaration which is overriding the overflow property to visible and remove it or update it to clip.\nimg {\n    overflow: clip;\n}\nIf updating the CSS is not trivial, another fix is to add the following inline style to the element.\n<img style=\"overflow:clip !important\">",

          "description": "The LTE digital baseband market was famously dominated by Qualcomm, which maintained a 60+% market share for nearly a decade (2009-2019).  MediaTek also successfully entered the market, but not for high end phones for high-income markets (U.S., Europe, etc.). Famously, both Intel and Broadcom (two semiconductor firms known for their ability to design successful chips in other markets, e.g., MPUs, cable modem chips, WiFi chips, Bluetooth chips, etc.) attempted to enter the market and failed. Broadcom exited the market and wound down their LTE business unit. Intel sold its group to Apple, which now has gone on to fail to develop a 5g digital baseband solution (Apple continues to use Qualcomm for its 5g digital baseband solution).\nWhy (from an engineering perspective) is it so difficult to develop an advanced  LTE (or 5G) digital baseband chip such that even semiconductor powerhouses like Intel and Broadcom have struggled to develop solutions which compare to Qualcomm's offerings?\nNote - answers from semiconductor design engineers appreciated :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33197429\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nMy friend tries to land her first job as UX. She had a maternity break from work, was working as buildings designer before. I can see she is slowly descending into depression since she gets rejected without being given feedback. Most recently she has gone through a series of interviews with the company, got to the final stage and was rejected- without any feedback. And this after investing her time into preparing assignments and taking tests...\nI try to coach her out from depressive thoughts she is getting, but it's not really helping. If I was running a company I would take her onboard, she wants to be UX but I think she would do whatever the current need would be to provide value.\nDo you know of anyone looking to get junior UX? Any advice would be of great value to her, thanks in advance!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33140493\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "Aside from a foundational understanding of database operations I really lack the proper knowledge to make proper design descisions for my databases and aplications that interact with those databases. There arent many people at my company that are particularly wise when it comes to this topic and it feels like we are really missing out on some really simple improvements just because we are oblivious to them.\nAre there any recommedations for essential reading or proper practice guides for improving database skills? I'm reading 'Database Internals' by Alex Petrov and its really interesting so far but not so practically applicable for me at the moment. It would be great to hear any resources that made a real impact on how you went about working with databases.\nI'm mainly interested in SQL databases but resources on no-SQL would be welcome too.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33118819\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 3",

It illustrated 5-6 different dimensions which one might optimize for (e.g. charging speed, capacity, cost, lifetime, etc) on these little charts which looked a bit like spiders' webs.\nI thought that was a great resource, but didn't save it at the time.  Anyone know what I'm talking about or have a link? Thanks!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33059097\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

Since this is early stage, I am not planning on spending a lot of time on the design, but would be great to have some guides/books that can help with the basics. For example a checklist of things that you need to consider with advice on how to pick each (font, color palette, basic layout, etc..)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32998487\nPoints: 6\n# Comments: 5",

          "description": "I haven't built mobile apps in years.  These days I carry an Android phone and am generally unhappy with how poorly these applications require a network connection to do anything. Many apps don't fail stable in the sense that if there is a server error they don't present the last known good view of data.  What this means in practice is if there is low network availability (on a train, at a concert or festival, a sporting event) many of these apps completely break.\nBack years ago I would design apps to sync to a local database (which was relatively easy to do on IOS). Apps would maintain consistent state on the device and leverage local storage.  I haven't looked under the hood but many apps appear to be using HTMLish front ends that are stateless, except for some cached login information.  As a user - what I see is that the app repeatedly tries to login and fetch all information every time you load it.  Which if you have perfect LTE/5G/WIFI is sort of ok, but in other situations sucks.  if the app can't talk to the network it really doesn't work at all.\nExample apps that generally fail stable: gmail, text messaging\nSort of fail stable: slack, although if you get a push message slack requires talking to the network to get the message even though it came through the push message.  In practice this means significant latency between seeing the message on the phone and then going to the conversation view (which can take forever to load under poor networking).  Back when I built apps we stuck the contents of the push message in the local DB so it was visible for users \nApps that don't fail stable: Hyundai blue link, Electrify America\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32970485\nPoints: 27\n# Comments: 14",

          "description": "I am a regular on a web forum where users quite often share screenshots from their iPhone, and in an attempt to redact identifying information in these screenshots, often do I find PII swabbed with the highlighting tool.\nEven with the Opacity set to 100% and the color to Black, it leaves the sensitive information underneath visible (yes I understand this is a highlighter, move on this note below).\nBefore you tell me the proper way to do it, which is to ...\n(once in Markup)\n1. Tap the Plus button on the far bottom right\n2. Select the Rectangle or Circle shape\n3. Tap the Shape Options button in the bottom left (the icon used doesn't even make it obvious as to what this button is for)\n4. Select Solid Fill for the shape\n5. Position solid shape over the sensitive information\n...\nMy argument is that while it is possible to properly redact sensitive information, it's much too easy for people to improperly redact because it is difficult to tell that a 100% opacity black highlighter does not work. On a phone screen, it can look completely opaque. Only once you see it on a better display do you realize just how visible the info is.\nAlso, while the pencil/pen tool (far left) does properly redact, its max size is much too small. People who use this one and just haphazardly try to scribble over all of the info, which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.\nSolutions:\n1. Create a tool specific for redacting\n2. Make it so that 100% opacity highlighting is opaque (or at least warn the user if they set the opacity to 100%). Yes, this is not what \"highlighting\" is, but make the default opacity value like 30-50% and have people change it as needed. If it looks opaque on a phone screen, IT SHOULD BE.\n3. Allow the user to set the max width of the pen/pencil tool much larger. Make it a sliding scale instead of 5 discrete sizes.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32941035\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

You then get one RSS feed which combines all releases into one stream.\nCreating multiple streams that combine by topic, programming language or whatever would be great too.\nDoes something like this exist? Or something similar? I know that Github offers feeds for single projects, but it feels tedious to add like 50+ single feeds to the reader.\nThanks for any tips!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33209227\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

A standalone desktop app is coming soon.\nHappy to hear any feedback and answer any questions!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33183781\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

Every morning you decide what you will do and what you will not do by swiping away objectives and only keeping ones you want to focus on for the day. Throughout the day you can mark items as complete and check on what objectives remain.\nI built Nodu to use myself (and to get my feet wet with SwiftUI). After reaching a V1, I decided to release it to the public.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33081253\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

As a developer, I've never liked it.\nReact and Tailwind made it an infinitely better experience for me, but something was still missing.

At the same time, I felt lost with No-code editors because they are made for designers not developers.\nI've written about it extensively here: https://rogovoy.me/blog/writing-html-sucks\nImpulse is my experiment to bridge that gap and make a \"design\" tool that works directly with my code.\nWith Impulse, I've come to love web design (again?).\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33007344\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",
