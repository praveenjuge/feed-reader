In case you’re not aware of what “alt text” or (“alternative” text) is, it’s the text value of the alt attribute of an <img>. It should describe the image (although in practice doesn’t always!).\nAs a user you might never notice alt text, but there are contexts where it’s incredibly important. Screenreaders will announce the alt attribute to a user, so for someone who is blind or partially sighted, the alt attribute can provide vital content that might otherwise be missed. It’s not good practice to put important text content in an image, but if for some reason you do have to do it then providing the same information in the alt text is essential to ensuring screenreader users get an equivalent experience.\nAnother time alt…",

I think it was Ahmad Shadeed who mentioned this on Twitter the other day, but I could be wrong.\nSo if you want to use clamp() for some fluid typography, say, with a calc() function for the middle value, instead of doing this:\nh1 {\n  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, calc(1rem + 3vw), 4rem);\n}\nYou can do this:\nh1 {\n  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 1rem + 3vw, 4rem);\n}\nIt totally makes sense, because min(), max() and clamp() already are math functions. But nonetheless, it’s something I wasn’t aware of before!\nIt works with custom properties too — check out this demo.\nIncidentally, if you want to know more about fluid typography in CSS (including accessibility concerns), this comprehensive guide by Adrian Bece has you covered.",

And then if I’m honest there’s a fourth and fifth variety: e-waste and a bag of old clothes and toys to donate. The big three live outside in the side yard and those last two live in piles in my garage until I can’t handle looking at them anymore.\nThe side yard has three enormous trash bins. The compost is always empty. The trash fills up, but we can atomic elbow that last bag in there. No problem. Our recycling… well, our recycling is always full and overflowing. You see, we’re bottlenecked by the city’s two week pick up cycle. When the bin fills up we create staging areas with paper bags to triage the excess recycling. The minute the city hauls off the previous load, we’ve filled up half of our capacity on our next tw…",

This post is for RSS subscribers only.\nRead more about RSS Club.\n\nTwo years ago, Easter of 2020, I was chatting with some friends about crypto and one friend was starting to set aside some money and invest. Seemed harmless to do with “fun money”. We were in a pandemic after all, so no one was doing anything anyways. This was the height of the Gamestop and $DOGE meme stock market drama. I dismissed crypto at the time, but I used my Stocks app to follow the prices of $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, $DOGE, $SHIB, $LUNA, $XRP, $XTZ, and a some others that crossed my periphery field of view.\nYou see, it’s not hard to sell me on crypto. “Big banks, payday loans, and fees are problematic” = yes. “We can decentralize identity and web logins” = yes, cool. “We can decentralize payment” …",

          "description": "One principle I’ve come to embrace is that the answer is rarely ever a spectrum. At first glance, a single-axis spectrum might make perfect sense, a reduction of the problem, a right and a left, a binary dichotomy but with a grey area in the middle. But as I grow older a spectrum falls short for me in a couple different dimensions.\nTake color for instance. As kids we learned about the ROYGBIV visible spectrum of light, the zone between infrared light and ultraviolet light that most of us humans can see.\n\nThe rainbow, a naturally occurring ubiquitous concept. Children love rainbows. A light spectrum makes for a great science experiment or album cover.

          "description": "Hi HN,\nwhile building something entirely, I realized that there is a lack of tools to pick colors for websites and web apps. While there certainly is an abundance of tools for color palettes, but they mostly give you three to five bright or pastel colors. Not what you need for websites. For that, you need one or two primary colors, and then stuff like text color, background, and so on.\nSo, together with another web dev I built a small web tool that allows picking exactly the colors you need for web projects and live preview your palette on a selection of demo websites.\nThe first version of the tool is online at https://colorsforwebsites.com. Free and no sign up.\nWe are already using this to for early stage projects, so I hope this provides value for you as well. Of course we are also happy about any and all feedback.\nCheerz :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31585749\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Trying submitting again. Previously shown here[0], Tamagui is now in beta.\nTamagui is the first UI kit for React that has an optimizing compiler - one that not only extracts styles at build-time, but even evaluates inline styles and inline logic like ternaries / conditional spreads. It also flattens components (even those logic-containing ones) completely down to a div or View on Native when possible.\nAll of this leads to amazing performance gains[1], especially on the web and low-end mobile devices.\nI think Tamagui is also really special outside of just the performance. It has an incredibly powerful theme system which you can truly change every aspect of every component through, it supports a `size` prop on every component that just works, and it has incredible first-class animation support.\nRead more on the recent Beta blog post:\nhttps://tamagui.dev/blog/tamagui-enters-beta-themes-and-anim...\n---\n[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29321748\n[1] https://tamagui.dev/docs/intro/benchmarks\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31470885\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I’ve been making art and putting it on the internet for 20 years or so. I’ve used:\n- forums\n- Blogger/Wordpress\n- personal portfolio sites\n- YouTube for tutorial videos\n- FB/Twitter/Instagram/Tumblr\n- Gumroad for digital products\nNone of these outlets feels like a good “home” to me. Forums were great for WIP feedback but the good ones all died and got hacked. Blogs and my personal sites have always been good, but discoverability isn’t there. Social media platforms gave me a little more visibility, but lock-in and platform culture are extremely toxic. Instagram, for example, is touted as THE social media platform for artists, but the way they process image uploads is awful. The promotion or burying of posts is opaque.\nI want to create my work and put it where people might have a chance of seeing it, without algorithmic shenanigans or dark patterns.\nWhy is this so difficult? How would you approach solving this?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31403791\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 3",

I've adopted the idea of \"use different shades gray to make UIs\" and, as a result, my sites look... professional but uninviting.\nConsider sites like:\n- https://curius.app/\n- https://www.notion.so/\n- https://www.focusmate.com/\nThese sites look warm and inviting. Being proficient with Tailwind CSS just helps me have good padding, margins, and a reasonable default color scheme. It doesn't help me make my site look... human.\nI feel like I need a \"design palette\" instead of a mere \"color/margin palette\". What's the recommendation for this?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31317653\nPoints: 7\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Hey!\nI’m interested in finding resources, postmortems, case studies, as well as personal success/failure stories of measuring development teams while scaling them - when it gets harder to do that directly, as you would in a small team.\nNow, don’t get me wrong, I’m not advocating for metrics like tasks delivered, commits done, lines of code changed (hard to even write the latter ones down without cringing). This kind of “productivity output measuring” sounds easily-gamed, very stressful, and ultimately fairly useless.\nThis can be a totally different approach - streamlining the identification of blockers, exploring what time sinks developers are being hindered by. I think this handbook by okay.com is a very good example of a great resource looking at the problem from that side: https://www.okayhq.com/handbook/getting-started/what-is\nMeasuring the time CI/CD pipelines take, PR’s take to be reviewed, etc. looks like a very sensible approach.\nWhat are your experiences? What worked for you? What did you hate?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31609471\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

Other times I am in flow at 100% and feel like if I didn't have to sleep or have meetings I could get everything on my plate finished.\nHow do others feel? Are you mostly working at your optimal productivity / motivation level? Has it changed as you got older?\nMaybe it's just me but there are days I get nothing done, and when you have daily stand-ups you simply cannot say that so you just make shit up or say you were swamped in busy work.\nI'm wondering if there is a better philosophy to managing people with this in mind, although I am finding that humans need deadlines and external pressure in some form or nothing gets done.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31563325\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

I hit them all the time unintentionally.\nMaybe hacker news could throw an @media section in the CSS and make the links large enough to avoid accidental taps on mobile?\nI have the same development philosphy as HN, roughly doing a minimal implementation that is close to what the machine requires. But I also value an interface that humans can use. I think with a couple lines of code HN could make this more usable without corrupting the spirit of a no-frills website.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31512626\nPoints: 5\n# Comments: 2",
