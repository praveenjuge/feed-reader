          "description": "In 2010 I discovered input masks.\nThey seemed like a smart way to prevent errors. Because they help users follow a format. And they do so without taking up space.\nBut the truth is that this fancy pattern degrades UX.\nHere’s why:\nProblem #1: They’re confusing\nFor example, the cursor advances automatically to the next position. And placeholder characters can’t be deleted.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tTelephone input mask replacing characters and advancing to the next position automatically\n\t\n\nProblem #2: They may be mistaken for an actual answer\nThis is because the mask looks like an input causing using to submit the form with errors.\nInput masks make the input look like it’s been answered\n\t\n\nProblem #3: They make the interface feel broken\nThis is because typing a restricted character gets ignored.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRestricted characters get ignored without giving users any feedback\n\t\n\nProblem #4: The format may be unfamiliar\nFor example, a phone number may require a country code which isn’t always expected and makes users work harder.\nInput masks may use unfamiliar formats that don’t make sense to everyone\n\t\n\nProblem #5: They’re misleading and verbose in screen readers\nFor example, they announce placeholder characters which aren’t part of the answer. And they don’t announce characters that were typed but ignored.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tVoiceover announces placeholder characters. And fails to announce characters that were typed but ignored.\n\t\n\nWhat to do instead\nLeave the input empty to make it obvious where the answer goes\nLet users type what they like so the interface doesn’t feel unresponsive and broken\nAllow multiple formats so users don’t have to fix something unnecessarily\nAllow users to check their answers either on a separate page or just below the field",

          "description": "I’ve previously written about the problems with regular sticky menus.\nIn response to those issues, some people suggest showing and hiding the menu as the user scrolls up and down.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tBondir’s sticky menu appears and disappears as the user scrolls\n\t\n\nThis seems smart because:\nthe menu gets out of the way to allow users to focus on the content\nit allows users to access the menu without having to scroll back to the top\nBut this approach is worse than regular sticky menus.\nHere’s why:\nProblem #1: They’re distracting\nThis is because as the user scrolls the content to fit in the viewport, the menu will suddenly appear.\nGood design doesn’t guess (wrongly) about what users need.\nProblem #2: They’re hard to control\nThis is because scrolling up too much reveals the menu when it’s not wanted. And scrolling down a bit by accident will hide it when it is wanted.\nGood design doesn’t take control away.\nProblem #3: They cause dizziness and nausea\nThis is because animation can cause dizziness, nausea, headaches and more.\nGood design avoids physical stress.\nProblem #4: They can impact performance\nThis is because JavaScript is needed to react to the scroll event which can drain the battery and degrade performance especially on low-powered devices.\nGood design is lightweight.\nWhat to do instead\nKeep pages short: Sticky menus are a symptom of long pages so fix the root cause.\nJust let users scroll: It’s a myth that scrolling is a problem. Even on mobile, the top of the page is a flick or 2 away mostly.\nPut relevant links in context: For example, add a subscribe form to the end of a post or add a CTA to a pricing section.\nUse a back-to-top link: They’re relatively unobtrusive (but only do this once you exhaust the other options).",

          "description": "In 2009 I was working on the Argos checkout flow.\nWe were considering focusing the first input when the page loads. The idea was to save users a click (never a good sign). Back then we had to use JS, but now we have the HTML5 autofocus attribute.\nEither way, automatically focusing the first input causes 5 specific problems that degrade UX.\nHere they are:\nProblem #1: it makes the page jump unexpectedly\nWhen any normal web page loads, focus remains at the top.\nWith autofocus, focus jumps suddenly to the first input.\nBut this is disorientating and may cause users to think something has gone wrong.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAutomatically focusing the input makes the page jump\n\t\n\nProblem #2: it stops users scrolling with the keyboard\nUsers often scroll a web page after page load by pressing ↑ and ↓.\nWith autofocus, the keys are ignored because the input is focused.\nThis makes the interface feel broken.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe up and down keys get ignored as focus is inside the input\n\t\n\nProblem #3: it stops users going back with the keyboard\nSome users navigate back by keyboard using #+← for example.\nWith autofocus, the shortcut is ignored because the input is focused.\nThis slows users down.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe keyboard shortcut to go back is ignored as focus is inside the input\n\t\n\nProblem #4: it’s unexpected for screen reader users\nWhen a web page loads, a screen reader announces the page title.\nWith autofocus, the input’s label is announced instead.\nThis is disorientating and causes users to lose context.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe screen reader announces the input instead of the page\n\t\n\nProblem #5: it works badly on mobile\nOn mobile, focusing an input usually opens the keyboard.\nWith autofocus this doesn’t happen. On Android, for example, the input is focused but the user has to tap again to open the keyboard.\nThis makes the interface feel broken.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tOn Android, the input is focused but the user needs to tap \n\t\n\nJust let users focus the first input\nGood design puts users in control.",

I have to say it’s pretty much the most inspiring conference I’ve ever been to. Right off the bat, Una hit the nail on the head when she said that (paraphrasing) if we thought 2022 was a good year for CSS, we ain’t seen nothin’ yet.\nUna’s talk was a whistle-stop tour of a huge number of features recently or just about to be released, which was mind-blowing in itself, but what was even more striking was the number of features she didn’t even have time to cover — a whole slide’s worth. It illustrates the blazing pace at which CSS is evolving right now, which as a CSS person, I’m very happy to see.\nBut I can understand why some people who aren’t quite as deeply immersed in the world of…",

          "description": "One of my favourite sessions at All Day Hey conference last month was Jack Franklin’s talk Abstractions, complexities and off-ramps. As web applications grow larger, they inevitably fall prey to complexity, despite our best intentions. The prevalence of third-party libraries to solve everyday coding problems is both a blessing and a curse. It can be tempting to reach for an off-the-shelf solution to save time now, but what happens what happens when that dependency is no longer maintained, or when developer needs change? Can you be sure you understand enough of the underlying code to fix any bugs created by pinning all-important functionality on an (often unpaid) open source maintainer?\nWe tend to npm install third-party dependencies unthinkingly. But these packages often rely on other depe…",

But those places were too cold and too remote for human operators in the winter months, so the Soviets devised a plan to deploy small Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs). Radioactive strontium-90 heats an arrangement of metal fins, the fins cool, and a semiconductor turns that energy into electricity. The RTG’s design was the same tech the Soviet Union used to deploy radio to areas without power. What could go wrong?\nIt’s worth noting this was the advent of the nuclear era; the pre-Chernobyl era.

          "description": "This is something I've been working on for a while. I've previously shared a video showing the designing and code exporting process of my web/mobile design tool[0]. I still felt at that point that there was a huge disconnect between development and design. I think I've solved that with these special components that allow:\n- developers to build their logic using zero effort, placeholder UI\n- designers to redesign these UI's while testing their work in its final form, in the full context of the application\n- developers to accept these ready-to-go designs in a way that doesn't clutter the codebase\nI oscillate between feeling ecstatic, because I feel like I'm on the edge of finally solving the back and forth handoff problem I've often dealt with, and some light despair, because I have a very small network (no decision makers) and would struggle to get something even perfect off the ground. I'm only saying this so someone reading is encouraged to either A) let me know that this is something they want or B) bring me back to reality, and explain why I'm wasting my time.\nCheers!\n[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36291173\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36491835\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Hey folks,\nI'm super excited to announce the release of a new UI for Apache Kafka, Confluent, Redpanda and Kinesis that focuses on Teams and Data Mesh. (Note: the desktop version is also very popular with individual developers!)\nWhy is this important? Because providing a solution that can be used by both IT and business (non-technical) users is essential when building applications that process business data.\nOf course, we are mainly developers working on Kadeck. So you won't miss any of the features you need to troubleshoot and monitor Kafka and your applications. In fact, we have put a lot of effort into making Kadeck the best UI for Apache Kafka on the market. This includes enterprise features such as fine-grained rights management, topic organisation with data owners, labels and topic (API) documentation, teams and roles as well as LDAP/AD connectivity, data policies and masking, audit log and much more.\nI hope you enjoy using Kadeck - either the free version or the Professional/Enterprise version - and please let me know your feedback. I always love to hear about your specific use case!\nHave a great day,\nBen\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36486868\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

I've been paying much more attention to the design space in tech and have become enamored with the idea of learning how to create similarly beautiful experiences. I've been particularly inspired by Andrew Wilkinson/Metalab, Brian Chesky/AirBNB, Apple, Any Distance, Flighty, etc. As I pay more attention to high quality design and UX, I'm realizing that outstanding design in and of itself can be enough to launch successful and beautiful software.\nI've been searching for high quality online education to study design in a more formal and rigorous manner, something equivalent to the MIT challenge, but all I've found are RISD's online certificates which cost $10k, or youtuber/twitter influencer courses. I'm willing to pay the 10 grand for those courses, but if I'm going to spend that much I'd like some validation that its really worth it.\nPrimarily though, I'd love to hear from any designers here about how you learned and honed your craft.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36469851\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I'm currently a SWE working at FAANGMULA, feeling a bit burnt out and exploring other paths within tech. I've been paying much more attention to the design space in tech and have become enamored with the idea of learning how to create similarly beautiful experiences. I've been particularly inspired by Andrew Wilkinson/Metalab, Brian Chesky/AirBNB, Apple, Any Distance, Flighty, etc. As I pay more attention to high quality design and UX, I'm realizing that outstanding design in and of itself can be enough to launch successful and beautiful software.\nI've been searching for high quality online education to study design in a more formal and rigorous manner, something equivalent to the MIT challenge, but all I've found are RISD's online certificates which cost $10k, or youtuber/twitter influencer courses. I'm willing to pay the 10 grand for those courses, but if I'm going to spend that much I'd like some validation that its really worth it.\nPrimarily though, I'd love to hear from any designers here about how you learned and honed your craft.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36465399\nPoints: 5\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "I don't even know where to start with this, but the UI/UX of Amazon Music is so incomprehensibly bad it's hard to believe it wasn't put together by first year interns. We're led to believe that FAANG hires the best of the best minds but it's increasingly obvious this can't be the case anymore. A short list of my experiences:\n* Infinite scroll is broken in the desktop browser. I can't access songs in my library beyond the letter A. Why infinite scroll is needed here or anywhere for that matter is an entire discussion unto itself.\n* Random music I've purchased is unavailable for streaming and has been reassigned to \"shuffle with other songs\" as I don't subscribe to unlimited. I can still download the songs and listen to them locally however. To put it another way, some stuff I've purchased looks like I haven't, perhaps in an attempt to get me to repurchase it.\n* Accessing a 30 second sample of a song is hidden behind a mess of dark patterns. Scrolling in this UI is broken as well with overlapping layers hiding text and graphics. In fact the whole purchasing of music has been deliberately obfuscated likely to encourage streaming.\n* Searching for music within your own library is nearly impossible.\nI could go on and on about this but my experiences have been so bad I'm left speechless as to how this made it to production. As a highly experienced technical user I can't help but feel how the average consumer forced to interact with this garbage feels.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36372298\nPoints: 6\n# Comments: 2",

But now with Reddit going dark and people looking for a new place to migrate to, I'm doing a quick launch today.\nA few quick things:\n1. I don't believe federated platforms will ever become mainstream. They have a whole host of problems, not the least of which is that they're too complicated for most people to use. This platform is not, therefore, federated.\n2. I don't know what the best way of monetizing a thing like this is. I see only two options: the Wikipedia model of running on donations, or being advertising supported (along with a paid ad-free tier).

          "description": "Hey hacker news\nI'm the founder and lead developer at Opine.cm, and we've just rolled out a new feature that hopefully will reduce the number iterations in your design or web-dev projects.\nI've always been a big fan of checklists. When checklists were introduced to hospitals prior to surgeries, the number of complications and deaths dropped by 35%. I use them a lot personally - but I know many designers and devs find it too much effort.\nThe reality is, we easily forget verbal feedback; the humble to-do list solves this. We've just taken the added step of using AI to turn any video feedback that you get into a to-do list.\nTo try it for yourself\n- Create an account at https://Opine.cm\n- Record some feedback on the design examples\n- Watch as the AI creates your to-do list.\nOr here's a demo\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/e7a6ccd0df0b4dfb8552bd08c7c8ab56\n(Quick note - The demo shows design work - but you can add also add websites in Opine.)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36353445\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hi everyone,\nI'm Joachim, and together with my co-founder, we're building Visoid - a tool for rendering architectural designs in an iterative manner.  We firmly believe that the future of this type of rendering, especially during the ideation stage of a project, will be heavily reliant on generative AI.\nTraditionally, you would send your designs to a professional and potentially wait several days for the renders to be ready, all the while going back and forth with consultations. With Visoid, you can now receive instant, beautiful renders at a fraction of the cost.\nOur platform is designed for architects and rendering professionals who work with visualizations of architectural designs. Visoid enables our users to iteratively modify the scene, materials, and elements in a sketch, 3D model or similar, controlled with a simple prompt.\nWe're still in the early stages, and while the output isn't always perfect, we've made significant strides in improving the quality and the control of the output images. We're confident that it's only a matter of time before we can consistently deliver higher quality images and with even more control.\nWe're still figuring out how to fit this product into the workflow of our users and would love to get your feedback. I will try to answer any questions you have.\nFor more example images, have a look at our Instagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/visoidai/\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36341692\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "I recently decided to document and open-source the component library that I've been using internally on all my react-tailwindcss projects and share it.\nRewind-UI uses only TailwindCSS classes, which can be overridden using the className prop on each component or can be fully customized using a theme provider.\nIt is built on top of the CVA (class-variance-authority - https://cva.style/docs) library, so if anyone needs to adjust the theme, will just need to edit the CVA files.\nFurthermore it must be noted that you can add either all the style files in your tailwind.config.js file, or only those that you are going to use, so that you can avoid having a bloated css file.\nYou can check out the repository here: https://github.com/rewindui/rewindui\nEven though it is still in beta I would love to hear your feedback on it.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36254203\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Lately I've been building an open source component library that I will be using on my projects at work and I'd love to get your thoughts and experiences on the react UI libraries you use, the challenges you face, and what you think could make them even better.\n1. Which React UI libraries do you use?\n2. What are your biggest struggles with the UI libraries you use? Every library has its pros and cons. I'd love to know the pain points you encounter while working with your chosen UI library. Are there any specific challenges or limitations you've come across that hinder your development process?\n3. What features do you feel are missing from your favorite UI libraries? Are there any particular features or functionalities that you wish your favorite library offered?\n4. What do you enjoy most about your preferred UI library? What do you enjoy most about the library you use?\n5. What are the most important features you look for when choosing a React UI library? When evaluating different UI libraries, what factors do you prioritize? Is it performance, ease of use, documentation, community support, or something else entirely?\nThank you in advance!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36238512\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 2",

It came up with a design that seems plausible to me (a non-expert), essentially using gyroscopes to induce controllable spin, and uses the Magnus effect to allow the orb to bend through the air like a soccer ball. Wanted to get Hacker New's take on whether this design is possible.\nStructure and Composition: The orb's structure is a sphere composed of strong, lightweight materials akin to those used in modern aircraft or spacecraft. These materials are capable of withstanding the pressures and forces experienced during flight while also minimizing the orb's overall weight.\nBuoyancy: The orb is filled with a lighter-than-air gas su…",

          "description": "I recently needed to check a past transfer to confirm that I was sending some crypto to the same wallet address. In the past, the last few transactions showed up on the \"Pay\" page. They have since renamed \"Pay\" to Transfers or something like that. They no longer show past transactions, so I went down a rabbit hole of searching through the app, couldn't find it, then had to google it and found a help page for Coinbase. There is a link in the article to coinbase.com/reports (I can find no way to get to it from the web app except by following the link from the help article.) Once there, you can select the date ranges you want and generate a transaction report in PDF or CSV and then you have to wait a bit while it generates the report for you to download.\nWhat kind of UI craziness is this? A user's transaction history is such a basic feature, I can't imagine contributing the obfuscation of this history to just incompetence. There must be some dark pattern here. Perhaps the want to hide from user's how much real money they are putting into the system? It seems like a serious security risk anyway. Someone with unauthorized access to an account could easily siphon off crypto and it would be difficult to notice unless you are frequently generating and downloading transaction reports and going through them.\nI am not finding much talk of this.

How to prep for System Design Interviews, given that most resources out there are very superficial in their explanation of what technology to use, when to use it and why to use it?\n2. Will becoming good at prepping for System Design interviews actually help in designing large scale systems better?\n3. If not 2, then how do you become better at designing actual systems?\nI already know that DDIA is a good resource but it does not help you design concrete systems.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36115528\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "I'm curious what methods people here use to avoid distractions when working on a computer. Obviously computers are excellent tools, but simply having access to an internet browser can be a gateway to a massive time sink.\nSome things I have tried:\n- Set up a Pi-Hole with distracting websites on the blacklist so the DNS requests do not resolve. I disabled this to dork around on the web today, so clearly not an effective commitment device.\n- \"Cold Turkey Writer\" which locks down your PC giving only a text box essentially, until you write X words. I didn't find this useful for my writing style since I tend to look up additional references/sources as I write, and losing access to that hurt my flow.\n- Using a Raspberry Pi 4B as my desktop PC, with the idea being I couldn't play games and YouTube isn't entertaining when 30% of the frames are dropping. I ended up wasting a bunch of time messing with Linux trying to get stuff to work (oh Obsidian needs to be compiled and installed for ARM, oh there's no Google Drive installer for Linux, let's set up rclone, oh the audio driver broke). It was cool to have a fanless, low-power PC but I went back to my Windows desktop out of frustration and desire to have things \"just work\".\nIs it futile to use hardware/software to try and fix a self-discipline issue? What works for you?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36346043\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "I’ve been using RSS readers for decades, but they’ve started feeling more and more like a chore. Something about the inbox/to-do list design, counts of unread items, managing teams and complex filtering rules... I realized they add to my stress level instead of reducing it.\nI’ve also come to rely on social media for discovery – hearing about new ideas, tools, papers, people, etc., but I’m so tired of the ads, spam, addictiveness, and toxicity.\nApricot is my attempt to distill the best of both worlds. It’s a web app where users subscribe to feeds like an RSS reader then see new items as they come in, in a single, combined, social media-style feed.\nApricot goes beyond traditional RSS readers in a couple other ways:\n  * Users can follow TV shows (via TVmaze), Spotify podcasts, Substack newsletters, YouTube channels, and Subreddits (if/when they come back online) in addition to traditional RSS feeds. I’m open to adding other platforms if there’s demand and the content is programmatically accessible.\n\n  * Cross-platform feed search. I know search isn’t hot at the moment but it’s pretty useful in this context. Search for “Star Trek” and find not just the TV shows, but the podcasts and Subreddits too.\n\n  * Items can be sorted chronologically or with an ML-powered recommender system.\n\n  * Users can filter their feed by platform, which is helpful for specific use cases like finding a good podcast episode for a car ride or a good TV episode to watch after dinner.\n\n  * On-demand, GPT-powered content summaries help users see what an article is really about before clicking. (gotta sprinkle some gen AI on there!)\n\nIf you’ve got a few minutes (and come on, with Reddit offline, I know you do), check it out and let me know what you think!\nApp: https://app.theapricot.io\nHomepage: https://theapricot.io\nBlog: https://blog.theapricot.io\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36314857\nPoints: 11\n# Comments: 17",

          "description": "Am I the only one using Thunderbird strictly as an RSS client? I've seen countless RSS clients recommended here over the years but none ever have the features to make me switch, mainly due to lacking extension support (for things like uBlock Origin and Bypass Paywalls) or privacy concerns from not running on a local Linux desktop. (I haven't heavily used the e-mail functionality in Thunderbird in over two decades. I haven't tried the Chat or any other functionality at all.)\nIs there something I'm missing out on? Is there a client with all the same features and then some that I just haven't found yet? I've looked at Feedly, Inoreader, and many others through the years but none have risen to the level of replacement. It's not broken so I'm not looking to fix it but I'm open to hearing how others manage their feeds to see if there's any possible improvements I've overlooked.\nFull disclosure: I've donated in the past to Thunderbird/Mozilla, including company matches.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36256681\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "I struggle with staying productive and organizing myself. I am a chronic procrastinator and have tried everything to be more productive like lists, calendars, apps, etc. but I still can't seem to get things done. I want to study more, read more, and finish my coding projects. However, I end up not doing much and feel terribly guilty. I suspect I may have ADHD or some kind of dopamine addiction but I'm not sure. I do well in school even by studying at the last minute, and I attend a rather challenging school. In my free time though, I end up doing very little or nothing, not knowing where my time went. I try to remove all distractions but it doesn't seem to work.\nDoes anyone have any advice or strategies on how I can improve my productivity and focus? How have you overcome similar challenges to achieve your goals and stay focused? I feel stuck in this cycle of procrastination and distraction and want to break free.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36184605\nPoints: 49\n# Comments: 62",

          "description": "I've been thinking a lot recently about how technology, particularly AI, can play a role in personal productivity. One concept that's caught my attention is the idea of an 'AI conversation companion' for tracking thoughts, ideas, and progress in various areas of life. Imagine having an AI that you can converse with on a regular basis, where it asks you thoughtful questions about topics you're interested in or working on. Over time, it adapts its questions based on your responses and generates summaries, which can be reviewed and reflected upon at any time.\nSuch an AI companion could act as a kind of automated journal or diary, providing a space for reflection and self-improvement, but with the added benefits of interactivity and adaptability. It could also serve as an accountability tool, reminding you of your goals and progress, and prompting regular reflection.\nWhat do you all think about the potential of using AI to aid productivity? Have you used any similar tools or services? What methods do you use today to prep helping future AI companions understand your life/goals?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36129315\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

I’m talking about VR having it’s ‘world-wide web’ moment instead of headsets being expensive, digital walled gardens. Seems to me that VR headsets have eaten themselves already. For example, A common criticism of Apple Vision Pro is “What problem does this solve? What is the killer app?”. Before the world-wide web, I believe the home personal computer was primarily used for games, similar to VR right now.\nActual HTML is a poor fit for this solution. Our ‘document’ metaphor doesn’t really translate so well to virtual space unless we’re doing work designed for the space (like spreadsheets or code). In such a case, floating windows may be appropriate to replace modern desktops. Otherwise, I think we need a protocol and language of some kind to serve and describe virtual space, either from the headsets or larger infrastructure.\nIs anyone working something like this?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36479864\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Hi,\nI really like HN and the simplicity of everything (from create/login workflow to submit links). Everything is fast, straight to the point, and clean/simple HTML.\nI've just a really minor complaint: on wide screen, reading comments is really painful (for me at least, I maximise all my windows...). It's not the size of the font, it's really the width of lines on wide screen. I've the impression that we're a lot of developers on HN, with huge screens, and the wide screens experience could be better in \"vanilla\" HN.\nI sometimes open a link in HackerWeb (for instance https://hackerweb.app/#/item/36238342) just to have a better reading experience...\nEvery thing else: don't change, it's perfect!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36238841\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 2",

The problem was that there was a repair attempt that had taken off the entire pad for the battery, and in fact had go through the pad, through the silk screen and had gone all the way into the fibre glass insulation layer (you might be able to see in the photo the woven pattern).\nBefore slapping a battery on and jumping the positive leg to the right component, I wanted to check that nothing else was missing. Thankfully the community have tried to preserve a lot of the history (in this case, the PCB traces) but also published it freely on the web.\nFrom this I also found a resistor had been lost in the previous repair. I don't think it's clear from my photo, but what I did was to bond the missing resistor in a completely different location (before it traces to a capacitor) and then use a jumper wire from the replaceable battery case. This was mostly in case the battery case was torn off again it wouldn't cause damage to the components on the board.\nOnce that was all done, the game happily had its clock and was returned to it's owner the same day.",

Then managed to pick up a faulty \"Color\" model for £40 on eBay listed as not working.\nOn inspection it looked, internally, very clean - no corrosion or damage. From my experience with Pokémon Mini handhelds, I was wondering if perhaps the power button wasn't getting the signal.\nSo I applied a slice of kitchen tin foil, some sticky tape and voilà, it powers up! I had to also apply it to the sound and start button (and I'll probably make this permanent with conductive paint one day), but otherwise it's all good.\n(And I snagged a flash cart so I was able to experience some translated romhacks too)",
