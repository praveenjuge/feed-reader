          "description": "Disabling paste is usually done in the name of security.\nFor example, let’s say the user has to type their email address twice. Using 2 separate inputs means a mismatch can be caught. But that doesn’t work if they paste an error from the first input into the second.\nBut disabling paste degrades UX and is a terrible way to stop users from making mistakes.\nHere’s why:\nProblem #1: It makes the interface feel broken\nThis is because users expect to be able to paste but instead it just gets ignored with no feedback.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tTrying to paste into the password field gets ignored as paste is disabled\n\t\n\nProblem #2: It slows users down\nThis is because the user has to type everything again from scratch.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tUser has to type the password manually because paste is disabled\n\t\n\nProblem #3: It increases the chance of error\nThis is because typing manually increases the chance of a mistake.\nGive control and let users check answers\nTo do this consider using:\nan email verification step\na ‘check answers’ page\na password reveal",

With most of Europe baking in a deadly heatwave with unprecedated temperature, the need for action on climate change is more pressing than ever. If you’re not sure what action you, as a developer, can take, my talk from All Day Hey conference provides some facts, figures and starting points for thinking about sustainability in the context of web development.\nAlthough it may seem like a big, scary topic, there’s a lot we can do in terms of mitigating environmental harm in our own work, sharing knowledge and influencing the industry as a whole. I hope you’ll find some useful takeaways here, and be encouraged to join the fight against climate change.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfPoOt7T5lg",

There’s a couple spots (southbound Burnet near North Loop) where you can catch air on a storm drain if you’re going the speed limit. The extreme Texas heat determines a lot of the road conditions by  warping the asphalt. The giant live oak tree clusters lifting entire sections of concrete do their part as well. But that doesn’t explain all the shoddy patch work rattling your hubcaps off.\nThere’s a human element happening as well. Some years ago I learned almost anyone can dig up a road.

On the positive side, nearly ~1,500 of those posts are from ~30 personal blogs I follow. That makes me happy that friends are posting on their sites and for the state of blogging in general.\nWhile I love RSS, it’s hard for me to “power thru” these personal blogs because… well… they’re personal. They’re more powerful and often more thoughtful and more well-researched than a content mill, more precious. Knowing there’s hundreds of gems in this pile of 1,500 posts slows me down. I want to savor these contributions, but it’s overwhelming like having the next year’s worth of content meals planned out.\nRather than let myself be overwhelmed, I made a deal with myself: One friend a day. I’ll zero out one personal blog a day. Dig in and get to know someone. Some have a handful of unread posts, some have hundreds. In a month or so I’ll finish and I’m sure the hopper will have refilled itself. Hopefully it’s more manageable this time.",

It’s petite and looks like a regular leather dad chair before it’s glorious transformation into a relaxation station. Per tradition, kids aren’t allowed to use dad’s recliner; it’s the one sacred space in our house.\nThe recliner has been a major boost to my calmness. Having my feet up after a long day of sitting at my desk produces a psychological effect that scientists refer to as “maxin’ and relaxin’”. This is not a sports-dad chair for yelling at my fantasy employees, oh no. This, my lovelies, is a book nook for a grown man. A stack of devices (iPad, Kindle, Macbook) sits piled next to the chair so I can follow whatever whim the Muses enchant me with, as the forefathers intended. President Ben Franklin once wrote in his diary “The secret to Man’s creativity is having a sweet ass recumbent chair.”\nThis recliner will launch a thousand blog posts. This recliner is where I’ll write the next great American sci-fi novel. This recliner is where I’ll create apps and games late at night after the family goes to sleep. This recliner is where I’ll nod off on lazy Saturday afternoons like a dog in the sun. This recliner is where I’ll store decades and decades of farts until I die and my children’s children judiciously and uncaringly throw it in a dumpster, divorced of sentimentality and awareness of the suitcases of emotional baggage from grandpa’s ancient computer job that I unpacked in this chair.",

It could be my taste buds evolving, some secret recipe update, or the news that the WHO is saying aspartame as “possibly carcinogenic”… but for whatever reason Diet Coke doesn’t taste as good to me as it used to, so I’m making changes. There’s a new beverage in my fridge: Liquid Death.\nLiquid Death? Isn’t that just water in a can? Yes, but specifically I’m enjoying the “Grim Leafer”, their agave iced tea. It’s a light flavor – agave-sweet, but not too sweet – an enjoyable step up from drinking boring ol’ water from a can. Although, the water in the ice cold can is delicious, cool, and refreshing. I’ve tried other drinks, but Liquid Death has been the one candidate with enough potential for a successful wholesale switch.\nLiquid Death is an interesting product to me. It’s entire brand is: water, but hardcore. As if Monster energy drinks started doing yoga and got passionate about staying hydrated. A weird blend of dad jokes and toxic masculinity applied to water. Why does water have to have skulls? Why not fill up a water bottle?\nI guess my answer for that is… I have water bottles. Thousands. I can do that but let’s be honest, sipping on water bottles is boring. A water bottle or double walled tumbler can’t match the tactile thrill of snapping into a cold one… mmm… that’s the user experience I crave. Me, a god, breaking open metal canisters with my bare hands. It’s not that sensational, but there’s a dopamine hit and selfish reward center activated in my brain.\nOne day I’ll ditch the cans and move over to plain ol’ sun tea or kombucha I brew in a window or closet (respectively). One habit substitution at a time though, starting with eliminating the “possibly carcinogenic” one.",

WebGPU is first and foremost the result of a collaborative effort including major companies such as Apple, Google, Intel, Mozilla, and Microsoft. Among them, some realized that WebGPU could be more than a Javascript API but a cross-platform graphics API that could be used by developers across ecosystems other than the web.

This post explains how to get started.\nPrior to Chrome 115, debugging webpages required building Chrome for iOS from source, as the release version of WKWebView did not support remote Web Inspector debugging. In Chrome 73, we added the chrome://inspect page which locally displays JavaScript logs to assist in debugging webpages. Now that WKWebView allows Web Inspector debugging in release (as of iOS 16.4), we have added a setting in Chrome 115 to enable this feature and further improve the developer experience.\n# Getting started\nOn your iOS device you need:\niOS 16.4 or greater.\nChrome 115 or greater.\nOn your Mac you need:\nThe Safari Develop menu enabled. Enable this from Safari application settings, Advanced Settings tab.\nOn your iOS device launch the Chrome app and navigate to Settings. In Content Settings, enable Web Inspector. Relaunch Chrome for iOS after changing this setting.\n# Debugging your site\nWith the setting enabled, you can debug any page running in Chrome for iOS by following these steps.\nConnect your iOS device to a Mac with a cable.\nIn Chrome for iOS, navigate to the website which you'd like to inspect.\nOn your Mac, launch Safari. From the Develop menu, hover over the name of your connected device and select the url of the website which you would like to inspect.\nThe displayed Web Inspector window will allow debugging of the current web view.

          "description": "I frequently make quick and small JS projects which do not need a complete React + Redux + Webpack environment (too heavy, bothersome to setup, re-learn and debug when it goes wrong).\nUntil now, I was mainly writing in them simple utils on top of native HTML API like `document.createElement` and `Element.prototype.textContent`.\nHowever, on a recent project, I just hit a spot where I began to have a lot of nodes, which made this call-based syntax hard to read.\nAfter wondering if I should use React and its nice JSX (leading to a whole setup) or learn another generally-complex UI framework with a nice syntax, I wondered if I could not just implement a solution that would both be readable yet very simple to setup and understand.\nSo here we comes! It's a very young and simple project (meant to be low maintenance), I may have missed some HTML peculiarities and I'm sure its share of performance gains.\nThe code is in the `main.mjs` file at the root of the repository.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37049525\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

My role will be on the backend and around infrastructure but since this is a core thing for them, I want to know more.\nIn particular, what is the best book/resource you would recommend for learning about modern UI/UX: principles, design methodology, practical tips?\nIt's important that it's not some foundational text from Bell Labs written in the 60s, although obviously nice if it mentioned a bit of history, but rather something focused on modern stuff, especially mobile apps. How is it actually done today.\nWhich technologies should I have at least cursory knowledge of, which tools are widely used, which are hip, and which are on the COBOL path? What is the modern approach to measuring and improving user experience?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37048996\nPoints: 5\n# Comments: 4",

          "description": "Hey HN,\nMy team and I recently released TotalWebTool as an all-in-one solution online to audit your website or web app. We'll release more documentation soon on all of the checks performed but it's currently over 150 covering technical SEO, security, performance, UX, code errors and accessibility issues. This includes everything from support for must haves like Core Web Vitals and goes all the way up to automated pen-tests (don't worry pen-tests are only manually initiated). We expect to continue growing the list of audits.\nThe goal is to be a place where you can keep track of your online properties and see whenever any issues arise. Automatic re-scans are supported.\nYou can try it today right from the homepage (https://totalwebtool.com) for a single page to see what it might find. We look forward to your feedback (likes and dislikes). API support for third parties is coming soon.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36963084\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I love the idea of making games for canvas in-browser. It's super fun and generally not very hard to get going with simple stuff. I've made a couple of very simple ( and ugly ) games on canvas already. They're not great because I'm not a game dev, I'm just some backend dork. As an aside, this has been a great \"intro to javascript\" for me, haha.\nWhether it's a good idea to build games in canvas or not is besides the point -- what I really need is a good \"introduction to game engine development\" so that I can have a stronger base to build my browser games on, and so I can learn the real fundamentals of game design.\nWhat do you recommend?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36877334\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hey HackerNews!\nI'm Renat Abyasov, CEO of Wonderslide, and today I'm thrilled to share our creation with you.\nWonderslide is an AI-powered presentation design tool that saves you time and effort. Simply input your draft, and in seconds, it generates stunning, fully editable PowerPoint slides.\nA few years ago, instead of reading a book to my daughter, I found myself creating slides for meetings and conferences. \"There must be a way to automate this routine,\" I thought. Then, I met a group of like-minded people who envisioned robots creating presentations instead of humans.\nWe had little more than a dream when we were just starting — a dream to stop wasting precious time on presentations. And now, after many countless iterations, we're finally ready to reveal our AI designer to the world.\nKey Features:\n • Automated slide layout and redesign with one click\n • ML-based image and icon matching\n • AI-powered text editing\n • Native export to .pptx\nThe AI designer seamlessly applies your content to the layout, incorporating color schemes, images, and icons, all optimized with the golden ratio in mind.\nUnder the hood, our neural networks analyze and structure different types of content, while the ChatGPT API helps highlight key points and condense text. The result is a range of slide versions for you to choose from.\nTry Wonderslide now and let us know your thoughts! Has it made creating presentations more efficient? Did it enhance the visual appeal? Is the user interface intuitive? Your feedback is invaluable as we strive to improve our service.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36775266\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hey there HN!\nI'm Marco and some time ago I've started (again) to stay up to date with RSS. But I wasn’t completely satisfied with the readers already out there, so I decided to built my own.\nWhat I want for an RSS reader is easily going through my feed and being able to open the article on the respective website. \nThat's because:\n- the majority of websites with an RSS feed don’t share the article’s full content because they want you to go on their website;\n- if an article is worth a long read and I want to save it, I’m using a read-it-later app.\n- I want to use a “disposable” browser and not my main one for reading, where I can nuke navigation data or auto-handle cookie banners (DuckDuckGo or Firefox Focus).\nWith that in mind, I decided to start the development of FeedFlow and now it's available for Android, iOS and macOS. On the tech side it's built with Jetpack Compose for the Android app, Compose Multiplatform for the desktop app, and SwiftUI for the iOS app. And the parsing is done with a library that I've developed called RSSParser: https://github.com/prof18/RSS-Parser\nFeedFlow offers a minimalistic feeds list and it opens the articles on their respective websites with the broswer of your choice (on mobile). FeedFlow also supports importing an existing RSS collection through OPML files.\nFeel free to ask any questions or share any feedback. Looking forward to it!\n- Marco\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36969264\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "I’m finding very little resource on this topic. However, it is paramount to follow it as a team grows or a company grows - I’ve known many companies whose developers effectively stopped developing anything of value, being burdened by bugs, bureaucracy, or poor relationships.\nTo be precise, productivity is the measure of outputs over inputs. In the engineering world, outputs are usually value increments (the definition of which varies according to each team’s mission and expertise. They could be user stories for devs, models for data scientists, terraform changes for ops), and input is time. I would note that I don’t know whether to count maintenance tasks in or out (such as keeping versions up to date) or the output definition. However, anything that does not bring obvious value (bug fixing, refactoring) should be counted out of output in terms of productivity - don’t get me wrong, refactoring is useful and important, because when done well it will improve future productivity. \nThe term “team” deserves some definition too. A team in my question has two attributes:\n- a common mission\n- size between 2 and 7 people\nI’m looking for testimonies and knowledge:\n- how is productivity measured in your team if you’re an engineer? In different teams if you’re at a management level? Conversely, is it not measured and do you know why?\n- how is productivity measured in companies you know, either through firsthand experience or well-documented sources? (Company articles, books)\n- are you aware of research in this area?\nOn a last side note, I would count research displayed in Accelerate out of the productivity question. The DORA metrics don’t delve into the complex details of “what is value for my team” and focus on the release level. The books and research are great, but arguably not about engineering productivity.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36939871\nPoints: 6\n# Comments: 13",

We’ve been hacking on software projects together for 15 years. We wanted an AI chat tool that runs on desktop and has a clean UI, so we built ReadyRunner.\nReadyRunner has 3 chat types:\n- Assistant Chat: Standard AI chat with a customizable library of system message prompts\n- ScratchPad: Collaborate on text/code with the AI in an editor alongside the chat (ScratchPad video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnbKLFR1TVs)\n- Document Chat: Upload and ask questions about PDF/text documents\nReadyRunner Features:\n- Powered by GPT-3 and GPT-4 (which you can switch mid-conversation)\n- Quick access hotkey\n- Runs on Mac, Windows or Web\n- System prompt library (customize assistant behavior in different ways)\n- Messages stream from top (so they are easier to read)\n- Messages in the assistant's memory are marked with a dot (and you can clear history mid-conversation)\nFree users get 10 free GPT-3 messages per month. Subscribers get more messages and GPT-4 access. Bring your own key plan for unlimited messages is also available.\nPlease give ReadyRunner a try and share your feedback.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36894326\nPoints: 7\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Am I the only one using Thunderbird strictly as an RSS client? I've seen countless RSS clients recommended here over the years but none ever have the features to make me switch, mainly due to lacking extension support (for things like uBlock Origin and Bypass Paywalls) or privacy concerns from not running on a local Linux desktop. (I haven't heavily used the e-mail functionality in Thunderbird in over two decades. I haven't tried the Chat or any other functionality at all.)\nIs there something I'm missing out on? Is there a client with all the same features and then some that I just haven't found yet? I've looked at Feedly, Inoreader, and many others through the years but none have risen to the level of replacement. It's not broken so I'm not looking to fix it but I'm open to hearing how others manage their feeds to see if there's any possible improvements I've overlooked.\nFull disclosure: I've donated in the past to Thunderbird/Mozilla, including company matches.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36691782\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 2",

High DPI, high resolution. Not excessively blurry, or retina-like. Good color representation.\n- Single monitor setup.\n- Be able to see 3 screens side by side comfortably, with my coding screen at minimum 16px font size\n- Around 1-1.5k.\n- Can be driven by a Macbook Pro\nI am currently comparing a Dell 43\" 4K Ultrasharp screen (dell u4323qe)  vs a LG 40\" Ultrawide 5kx2k (lg 40wp95c-w). I don't have any experience using an ultrawide vs a very large screen so feedback around that decision (or recommendations of other monitors) would be very useful.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36682537\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 16",

          "description": "My 11yo daughter has started to express interest in web app development. I run a web agency and my natural inclination would be to teach her a bit of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and then help her to “learn by doing”.\nPart of me, however, feels like these technologies risk becoming increasingly irrelevant. Between improvements in low-code/no-code platforms and LLMs that write code for you, I’m not sure how useful these skills will be to her down the road.\nWhat do people think? What are the right tools and technologies nowadays to put in front of a tween interested in software development?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36929720\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 5",

          "description": "Hello HN!  SnipCSS is a Free Chrome extension (with pro version) that I think many web developers would find useful!\nIf you ever tried to copy styles from devtools to recreate a design you know it's very tedious to select each element needed and copy styles. SnipCSS automates that better than anyone.  Nothing else merges/splices styles into a usable snippet that stays true to the original design.\nAfter getting the extension working well enough to collect snippets, I took it a lot further.  I added features to scope the CSS, templatize repeating items, inject lorem ipsum data, and then convert snippets to React/Vue with ChatGPT.\nI'm even building a template directory of snippets based on the designs I've collected from random websites.\nMaking a universal tool to componentize anything on a web is a big project so it took me a couple years to get here.\nDuring that time I've gotten very little feedback.  I really suck at talking to users.  So please let me know your thoughts and leave a comment!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36864963\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",
