So developing your CSS mobile-first should also be great, too…right? \nWell, not necessarily. Classic mobile-first CSS development is based on the principle of overwriting style declarations: you begin your CSS with default style declarations, and overwrite and/or add new styles as you add breakpoints with min-width media queries for larger viewports (for a good overview see “What is Mobile First CSS and Why Does It Rock?”). But all those exceptions create complexity and inefficiency, which in turn can lead to an increased testing effort and a code base that’s harder to maintain.

In case you’re not aware of what “alt text” or (“alternative” text) is, it’s the text value of the alt attribute of an <img>. It should describe the image (although in practice doesn’t always!).\nAs a user you might never notice alt text, but there are contexts where it’s incredibly important. Screenreaders will announce the alt attribute to a user, so for someone who is blind or partially sighted, the alt attribute can provide vital content that might otherwise be missed. It’s not good practice to put important text content in an image, but if for some reason you do have to do it then providing the same information in the alt text is essential to ensuring screenreader users get an equivalent experience.\nAnother time alt…",

The compost is always empty. The trash fills up, but we can atomic elbow that last bag in there. No problem. Our recycling… well, our recycling is always full and overflowing. You see, we’re bottlenecked by the city’s two week pick up cycle. When the bin fills up we create staging areas with paper bags to triage the excess recycling.

          "description": "Hi HN, Peter here, founder of Karate Labs (https://karatelabs.io) joined by my co-founder Kapil. Karate is an open-source solution unifying API and UI test automation, including mock servers and performance testing (https://github.com/karatelabs/karate).\nBack in 2016, I was part of the API platform team at Intuit. An issue had been slowing down the team: a particular test for a set of key services would randomly fail, and it was not clear if this was a problem with the test or if there was a genuine defect. The deeper I looked, the more the complexity around the test-suite freaked me out. It was using an in-house framework, which had evolved over years and the test depended on code in multiple files scattered across the workspace.

I also see data models all over the place between services, sometimes held inside an excel sheet. Also there's no standardized system that people actually use (Like UML but I rarely seen it used.)

There are also specific methodologies for software architecture, like creating ERDs and flowcharts. Same for the server infrastructure and persistent datastorage.\nWhat I'm looking for is one tool that combines all the various domains of a piece of software with varying levels of complexity. So something that gives a full overview that also allows you to 'zoom in' on specific layers for more detail.\nIs there any tool out there that provides this level of varied complexity and global overview? Of do you use something that's not made for it but works well?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31703199\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 12",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nwhile building something entirely, I realized that there is a lack of tools to pick colors for websites and web apps. While there certainly is an abundance of tools for color palettes, but they mostly give you three to five bright or pastel colors. Not what you need for websites. For that, you need one or two primary colors, and then stuff like text color, background, and so on.\nSo, together with another web dev I built a small web tool that allows picking exactly the colors you need for web projects and live preview your palette on a selection of demo websites.\nThe first version of the tool is online at https://colorsforwebsites.com. Free and no sign up.\nWe are already using this to for early stage projects, so I hope this provides value for you as well. Of course we are also happy about any and all feedback.\nCheerz :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31585749\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

From a glance, my idea of a bundler is a utility that takes code from software packages and assembles it with autogenerated boilerplates to produce front end applications that can run without any backend dependence.\nFrom looking at a few, my concern is they are inherently bloated and fill a gap that really shouldn’t exist.\nShouldn’t JS client code be assembled with packages as a standard, something that compiles together without all this filler nonsense?\nThese things typically produce tens of thousands of lines just to add simple libraries.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31562460\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 5",

          "description": "Trying submitting again. Previously shown here[0], Tamagui is now in beta.\nTamagui is the first UI kit for React that has an optimizing compiler - one that not only extracts styles at build-time, but even evaluates inline styles and inline logic like ternaries / conditional spreads. It also flattens components (even those logic-containing ones) completely down to a div or View on Native when possible.\nAll of this leads to amazing performance gains[1], especially on the web and low-end mobile devices.\nI think Tamagui is also really special outside of just the performance. It has an incredibly powerful theme system which you can truly change every aspect of every component through, it supports a `size` prop on every component that just works, and it has incredible first-class animation support.\nRead more on the recent Beta blog post:\nhttps://tamagui.dev/blog/tamagui-enters-beta-themes-and-anim...\n---\n[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29321748\n[1] https://tamagui.dev/docs/intro/benchmarks\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31470885\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

It’s a fairly new tech stack and the position is Senior/remote. I will have an onboarding buddy though.\nI will have to dig through a large codbase, and the codebase of the framework we are using.  Besides that, the business part is also completely new to me.\nI wonder: What are your tools and habits you use to accomplish something, store gained knowledge, dig through codebases etc.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31728507\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

I took an accidental 10 year hiatus and I've been polishing it up recently to get back into it.\nIt used to be really popular to promote your RSS feed. Might have just been the circles I swam in, but people knew what to do with it. I've maintained this big orange RSS symbol in my main navigation and I wonder: Does anybody actually know what to do with this now?\nFirefox used to offer subscription options but I don't see anything in the navbar any more. If you click the symbol on my page, you just see an ugly page of XML.\nIn the vain hope that somebody might want to see what I'm writing and be notified about it, how do I enable this? Do I have to post updates on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram and etc, etc?\nI've been consuming RSS for all this time but the rest of the world seems to have moved on.

          "description": "Hey!\nI’m interested in finding resources, postmortems, case studies, as well as personal success/failure stories of measuring development teams while scaling them - when it gets harder to do that directly, as you would in a small team.\nNow, don’t get me wrong, I’m not advocating for metrics like tasks delivered, commits done, lines of code changed (hard to even write the latter ones down without cringing). This kind of “productivity output measuring” sounds easily-gamed, very stressful, and ultimately fairly useless.\nThis can be a totally different approach - streamlining the identification of blockers, exploring what time sinks developers are being hindered by. I think this handbook by okay.com is a very good example of a great resource looking at the problem from that side: https://www.okayhq.com/handbook/getting-started/what-is\nMeasuring the time CI/CD pipelines take, PR’s take to be reviewed, etc. looks like a very sensible approach.\nWhat are your experiences? What worked for you? What did you hate?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31609471\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

Other times I am in flow at 100% and feel like if I didn't have to sleep or have meetings I could get everything on my plate finished.\nHow do others feel? Are you mostly working at your optimal productivity / motivation level? Has it changed as you got older?\nMaybe it's just me but there are days I get nothing done, and when you have daily stand-ups you simply cannot say that so you just make shit up or say you were swamped in busy work.\nI'm wondering if there is a better philosophy to managing people with this in mind, although I am finding that humans need deadlines and external pressure in some form or nothing gets done.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31563325\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "In the 90's, a number of teenagers made Geocities sites, which awakened their interest in web development and taught them some basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Many of these teens went on to become web developers.\nLater, many teenagers learned these skills as they customized their LiveJournal or MySpace.\nLater still, many teenagers learned these skills customizing their Tumblr.\nDoes Gen Z have anything like this, that is creating a pipeline to web development? I know Tumblr and LiveJournal still exist, but they don't seem to be popular with Gen Z at all.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31667761\nPoints: 33\n# Comments: 54",

I hit them all the time unintentionally.\nMaybe hacker news could throw an @media section in the CSS and make the links large enough to avoid accidental taps on mobile?\nI have the same development philosphy as HN, roughly doing a minimal implementation that is close to what the machine requires. But I also value an interface that humans can use. I think with a couple lines of code HN could make this more usable without corrupting the spirit of a no-frills website.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31512626\nPoints: 5\n# Comments: 2",
