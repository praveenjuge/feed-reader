There are a couple of useful (free) tools I reach for on these occasions.\nn:point\nn:point provides lightweight, publicly accessible API endpoints for your JSON data. It’s super easy to use: simply give it some JSON and it sets up an endpoint in seconds. No messing about with access tokens, it’s ideal if you just want to fetch some data. You can also define and lock the JSON schema. I’m using n:point for a Codrops article on creating an interactive line graph based on timeseries data.\nMockeroo\nIf you need to actually generate some data, Mockeroo is a tool that enables you to do just that. You can add rows of different types and Mockeroo will generate random data. There are configuration options, including setting ranges (for numbers and dates, for example), and including null values. If you’re happy writing Ruby, you can also include formulas and you can download the data in different formats.\nI’ve only used Mockeroo for generating JSON, but you can also create API endpoints. It’s not as quick as n:point to set up, but looks useful if you need to mock any more complex API requests.",

As someone who speaks a handful of languages, I like incorporating different languages, phrases, and untranslatable words into my day-to-day blogging. 「手答え」(tegotae) is an example of one of those words. It directly translates to “hand response” but is sometimes translated as “haptic feedback” or “game feel” when used in a video game context.\nOne problem with my use of other languages is that I’m lacking proper lang attributes on the foreign text, which makes it inaccessible.

          "description": "The YouTube gods surfaced me a video of classical guitarist Brandon Acker comparing a $200 guitar, a $2,000 guitar, a $20,000 guitar, and a $200,000 guitar. As you step up in orders of magnitude in cost, you start to see what creates value: the materials, the resonance, the sustain, the ease of playability. I’ve played guitar all my life and I never even imagined $200,000 guitars existed. I won’t spoil which one is the best but the result is shocking! Every guitarist I’ve talked to that’s seen this video had the same reaction.\ntl;dr- I would love to see someone do this with websites.\nBonus: Building a classical guitar from scratch\n\nIf you want a behind the scenes look at what goes into making a $20,000 guitar, musician and YouTuber Rob Scallon spends a week+ building a classical guitar with the same classical guitar luthier from the previous video,  Marshall Bruné. It’s a two hour video and I gobbled up every minute. Planks of wood and chunks of bone transformed through bending, shaving, sanding, gluing, and polishing; a transfiguration into a masterpiece. Incredible.\nAs mentioned in other carpentry videos I’ve watched, I love the little glimpses into the bespoke tools experts create to do their job well; the benders, the shapers, the hole cutters. The processes too! The fretboards are aged a minimum of seven years in a humidity controlled environment! How would you even know to do that without centuries of institutional knowledge? It’s interesting to see where these masters of their craft draw the line on what to do bespoke (the body) and where to leverage prefabrication and modern machinery (the neck).\ntl;dr- I would love to see someone do this with websites.",

The tokens could then be redeemed for activity on other websites. Since then, we've received feedback that the name led to a misunderstanding that the API provided a signal of trust determined by the browser. The word \"trust\" has different meanings for different sites, and the website issuing the token determines the signal of trust.\nWe're renaming the Trust Token API to Private State Token API to better showcase its privacy and utility benefits.\nThe API provides a small amount of storage to allow organizations to convey information from one context (token issuance) to another (token redemption)  in a privacy-preserving manner. The tokens are designed to help protect the user's identity by using techniques such as cryptographic  blind signatures.\n# Engage and share feedback\nDemo: The Trust Tokens origin trial has closed, so the demo won't work, but you can still view code for trust token issuance and redemption.\nGitHub: Read the proposal, raise questions and follow discussion.\nW3C: Discuss industry use cases in the Antifraud Community Group.",

The goal is to make interior design easy and fun, like playing with Lego.\nIt started off as an app to simulate housing in an MMORPG, since the furniture system there was atrocious. I'm now trying to adapt it as a simulator for general interior design.\nLike many 3D design software, there are a bunch of tools and controls, and first-time users may feel somewhat lost. So I've made a starting tutorial to help ease users into the controls.

The backend is in place, but I'm not quite comfortable with the UI part. I need to build a UI that is responsive. Are there any recommended drap/drop UI builders that can export the required HTML/CSS that I can just shove into my existing rails app?\nSites like wordpress will allow me to create a UI and some backend but it is a new backend that I'll need to learn.

          "description": "So much talk about Twitter alternatives in recent days, including people migrating to Mastodon and even Jack Dorsey announcing his new decentralized social media platform.\nI was thinking, if I was to build a new micro-blogging aka Twitter alternative, what technological choices would I make to get it quickly off the ground but allow for scale?\nWhat database technology or approach would you go for?\nWould you build a (mobile first) web application first or would you start straight away with a native iOS/Android app (maybe Flutter)?\nWould you go for a centralised or decentralized approach? If the latter, how would you decentralize it without sacrificing the \"public town square\" effect that Twitter currently has but is clearly lacking with the fragmentation of Mastodon?\nTo answer my own question, I would probably build a centralized platform like Twitter is now, probably opt for a fast NoSQL database like Google's Firestore in Datastore mode and to keep things simple I would probably even make sure that tweets would get automatically deleted after some years as I don't think it's needed to build a forever growing database of people's thoughts in that moment that persists for decades to come. Micro-blogging always felt to me as a thing right now, a thought in this moment but that thought could be different in a few days, months and definitely a few years, so why store it forever. Feels like I could save a huge operational cost and prevent abuse by not keeping tweets for beyond their relevancy.\nWhat are your thoughts?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33419574\nPoints: 137\n# Comments: 311",

I've been using atomics but as the complexity grows it becomes hard to review code for \"correctness\". My goal is to avoid holding locks for long periods of time.

          "description": "If you like me have many events during the day, you are probably also tired by constant switching to Mac Calendar or Google Calendar just to check when the next event starts. I searched for a widget that would show me upcoming events in some \"always visible\" way, but all apps showed the schedule in a separate window. So I decided to make a new app that would show a schedule right in a Dock icon.\nMore to this, My Upcoming Events shows a countdown in the same Dock icon several minutes before the start of the event, which is handy for me, so I can start right on time.\nLimitations: MacOS, Google Calendar only.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33371373\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

I'm pretty sure it was an article published after 2019.\nHopefully someone remembers this and can share the link with me in the comments.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33311156\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I'm working on an LED art project that combines a few realtime signals; audio and some other inputs to inform the visuals. I'm running things on an ESP32 right now and doing an FFT and some other sort of seat-of-the-pants DSP stuff on one core while the other handles bluetooth, LED control, etc. I've got some time to mess around and I'd like to get a broad strokes overview of the embedded DSP field to inform myself on where to explore next. I've got a fair bit of hands on experience but little formal training.\nUltimately the goal is to *make good art* so I'm not really looking for anything specific. In my head I'll get some good papers/textbooks/libraries/articles recommended to me and then I'll spend a few weeks to write toy implementations of whatever seems interesting in C to get a feel for the space.\nI'm particularly looking for the nitty-gritty type stuff, cool hacks that save cycles and improve latency, my goal here is visceral reactivity and I'd like to get some more tools in my toolkit that allow me to interpret and combine signals in realtime in interesting ways. Even info on cool math hacks like Carmack's fast inverse square root would be appreciated.\nP.S. Also of interest is material on debugging and modelling realtime code.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33294641\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I recently started using AWS for my new job, and am currently stuck with CloudWatch for logs. I used to dislike Graylog because of the clunky interface, but I just cannot extract anything from CloudWatch! My logs are there, I can view them but it's impossible to query them:\n- on the Log Streams page, the pagination doesn't work, I can only view page 1\n- if I do \"Search all streams\" with a basic filter (something like `foo = \"bar\"`) it doesn't return anything (I know there are some matches I can see them)\n- Logs Insights is limited to the last 3 hours of logs\nIs there an alternative CloudWatch interface somewhere that would allow me to finally query my logs? I don't care if it's a CLI, a heavy client or a webpage, I just want to query my logs...\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33286260\nPoints: 14\n# Comments: 4",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nI've recently gone through a few interviews where I did poorly on system design questions like \"design twitter.\" The interviewers expressed a wish to see me go more in depth on technologies, but I simply don't have much experience in any of them, as my current role is heavily ML focused and issues of scaling were long-ago solved by my large employer.\nMy question is are there any recommendations for ways to get more experience on system design? For most things it'd be as simple as \"start a project revolving around X\" but for scaling.. you kind of need users first. Was wondering how to get around this problem.\nThanks\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33263962\nPoints: 19\n# Comments: 9",

          "description": "The LTE digital baseband market was famously dominated by Qualcomm, which maintained a 60+% market share for nearly a decade (2009-2019).  MediaTek also successfully entered the market, but not for high end phones for high-income markets (U.S., Europe, etc.). Famously, both Intel and Broadcom (two semiconductor firms known for their ability to design successful chips in other markets, e.g., MPUs, cable modem chips, WiFi chips, Bluetooth chips, etc.) attempted to enter the market and failed. Broadcom exited the market and wound down their LTE business unit. Intel sold its group to Apple, which now has gone on to fail to develop a 5g digital baseband solution (Apple continues to use Qualcomm for its 5g digital baseband solution).\nWhy (from an engineering perspective) is it so difficult to develop an advanced  LTE (or 5G) digital baseband chip such that even semiconductor powerhouses like Intel and Broadcom have struggled to develop solutions which compare to Qualcomm's offerings?\nNote - answers from semiconductor design engineers appreciated :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33197429\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "This is not for 'deep' or 'slow' reading with intention and focus. The idea is that you have a large pool of incoming stories and you aren't interested in 'reading' all of them, but you want to reduce the chance of missing a single story. You want to 'screen' all stories.\nThis UI explores a 'mark-and-clear' idiom; you mark a group of stories as 'read' and then you clear that group, purging the stories from your view completely.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33176585\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

I can see she is slowly descending into depression since she gets rejected without being given feedback. Most recently she has gone through a series of interviews with the company, got to the final stage and was rejected- without any feedback. And this after investing her time into preparing assignments and taking tests...\nI try to coach her out from depressive thoughts she is getting, but it's not really helping. If I was running a company I would take her onboard, she wants to be UX but I think she would do whatever the current need would be to provide value.\nDo you know of anyone looking to get junior UX? Any advice would be of great value to her, thanks in advance!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33140493\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

There arent many people at my company that are particularly wise when it comes to this topic and it feels like we are really missing out on some really simple improvements just because we are oblivious to them.\nAre there any recommedations for essential reading or proper practice guides for improving database skills? I'm reading 'Database Internals' by Alex Petrov and its really interesting so far but not so practically applicable for me at the moment. It would be great to hear any resources that made a real impact on how you went about working with databases.\nI'm mainly interested in SQL databases but resources on no-SQL would be welcome too.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33118819\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 3",

I started on this with [html2notion](https://github.com/Jeadie/html2notion), but it turned out to be alot of work.\nWith Notion already having a [Notion web clipper](https://www.notion.so/web-clipper), I was wondering if it was worth implementing? Personally I read a small fraction of the blog posts from my RSS feed, and I like the spare page to take notes. For me, notion-rss solves the one core problem I have, acquiring and filtering high quality RSS feeds.

          "description": "I'm fairly new to the field and relatively late to the party (because I'm old), but a recurring theme that I'm noticing in my current company (which is a small startup) is how the faster you deliver the better you look to the CEO and even CTO's eyes.\nIn hour fairly infrequent meetings other engineers have raised the point that we should start valuing code quality and proper testing to our codebase, only to be met with arguments such as \"the customer doesn't pay for good code\".\nFurthermore, most likely an anecdotal bias and nothing else but I want to mention it: Online elitism revolves around shipping speed too. Comments like \"I can build X in Y hours\", \"I can skim the docs and build what I want with Z library in less than a day\", and so on.\nHow does everyone feel about it? Maybe it's just me but it feels weird. It's kinda like everyone I mentioned feels like there are no trade-offs to be concerned in regards to speed over quality or people decided that there's no reason to bother ourselves with contemplating what we're trading off speed with. Also, I feel that because quality is subjective and perfect is the enemy of done, people rely on objective metrics like \"time taken\".\nIs there truth and merit to this observation?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33394730\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

You then get one RSS feed which combines all releases into one stream.\nCreating multiple streams that combine by topic, programming language or whatever would be great too.\nDoes something like this exist? Or something similar? I know that Github offers feeds for single projects, but it feels tedious to add like 50+ single feeds to the reader.\nThanks for any tips!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33209227\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

A standalone desktop app is coming soon.\nHappy to hear any feedback and answer any questions!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33183781\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",
