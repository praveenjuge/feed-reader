It’s a bit of a maintenance patch featuring bug fixes, dependency updates, and some docs updates.\nRead on for the highlights or head to the v4.6.x docs to see the latest in action.\nWhat’s changed\nThere are two big highlights in v4.6.2:\nFirst, we’ve added an example to our Collapse plugin docs to show how to use horizontal collapsing. This has long been possible via our JS, but we never had an official class to utilize it.\nSecond, we’ve replaced the deprecated color-adjust with print-color-adjust in our Sass files as part of the Autoprefixer v10.4.6 issues. This should quiet the issues folks have seen from that dependency change. If you’re using our distribution CSS files, like bootstrap.min.css, you may still see the warning.\nBeyond that, we’ve addressed a few other things:\nTweaked the size of small and .small to compute to a whole pixel value (was 12.8px and now is 14px).\nImproved accessibility around our dropdowns, color contrast, and role attributes.\nFixed some broken links to supporting documentation.\nUpdated dependencies across the board.\nReview the GitHub v4.6.2 release changelog for more details.\nFrom here, we don’t expect to ship any meaningful updates to v4.6.x other than major security or dependency updates. Everything will focus on v5 and beyond after this release, starting with the stable release of v5.2.0. Bootstrap 4 will officially end of life January 1, 2023, though you’re obviously welcome to continue using it longer than that. Follow our release repo to stay in the loop on release maintenance status.\nSupport the team\nVisit our Open Collective page or our team members’ GitHub profiles to help support the maintainers contributing to Bootstrap.",

I’ve seen this idea shared by master CSS animators Jhey and Amit on separate occasions, and it’s such a neat little trick that it’s worth recording here!\nLet’s say we have a group of elements, and we want them to animate in turn on a loop — such as this wavy text example. We’re calculating the animation-delay value them using a custom property corresponding to the element’s index.\n<h1>\n  <span style=\"--i: 0\">B</span>\n  <span style=\"--i: 1\">O</span>\n  <span style=\"--i: 2\">U</span>\n  <span style=\"--i: 3\">N</span>\n  <span style=\"--i: 4\">C</span>\n  <span style=\"--i: 5\">I</span>\n  <span style=\"--i: 6\">N</span>\n  <span style=\"--i: 7\">G</span>\n</h1>\nspan {\n  --delay: calc(var(--i) * 200ms);\n …",

          "description": "Dave Rupert recently published a post expressing his frustration with the urgent case for action on climate change, and lack of co-ordinated policy action by the people in power. While much of the world suffers from extreme high temperures this summer, climate change has become a visible, tangible issue for many of us.\nDave rightly points out that the environmental responsibility has been unfairly hoisted onto the consumer, when in reality this is by the design of governments and large corporations, who have vested interests in maintaining the status quo. Individual lifestyle changes, such as reusable shopping bags, sorting our recycling, or going vegan are never going to make much of a difference when faced with the unstoppable juggernaut of capitalism.\nI agree that widespread societal ch…",

          "description": "Something I like about logical properties is the ability to set margins or padding on just a single axis on an element, while leaving the other alone. Say we have an element on which we’ve set some padding using the padding shorthand:\n/* This gives us 1rem padding all the way around */\n.box {\n  padding: 1rem;\n}\nIf, later on, we want to adjust the padding only on the x-axis (while preserving our original value on the y-axis), we have a couple of choices:\nWe could use padding-left and padding-right. Fine, but longer than our original shorthand.\n.box--some-variant {\n  padding-right: 2rem;\n  padding-left: 2rem;\n}\nWe could use the shorthand, but remembering to include our original values.\n.box--some-variant {\n  padding: 1rem 2rem;\n}\nI’m not a huge fan of having to repeat the original value for the y-axis padding. We could abstract those values out into custom properties — something like this:\n.box {\n  padding: var(--py, 1rem) var(--px, 1rem);\n}\n.box--some-variant {\n  --px: 2rem;\n}\nOn the other hand, there is a logical property that enables us to adjust the padding on a single axis: padding-inline refers to the padding on the x-axis when the document is in the left-to-right (default) or right-to-left writing mode. padding-block refers to the y-axis. (Those directions are reversed for a vertical writing mode.)\nSo instead we could write:\n.box {\n  padding: 1rem;\n}\n.box--some-variant {\n  padding-inline: 2rem;\n}\nCodepen demo →\nThe same applies to margins, borders and a bunch of others. And check out the inset property for a great positioning shorthand!\nLogical properties are very well supported in browsers now, so it’s a good time to start using them.",

That’s almost one Netflix… to have tab completion!? $10/month for copy-pasta from StackOverflow? No way, José.\nOn the other hand, if you asked me, “For ~$100/year, I can make coding a little easier.

          "description": "I’m not dying, but before I do I want to share with you — future generations of rockers — what I know about putting on a live music rock show.\nThe audience’s energy will match your energy. If you stand like a turd on the stage, they audience will stand like a bunch of turds. If you bob your head, they’ll bob their heads. If you move around, they’ll move around. If you show low confidence, they’ll have low confidence in you and start checking out.\nDon’t let your band drama show on stage. Every band has drama, but don’t let it show on stage. The audience isn’t there for that.\nPractice setting up and tearing down efficiently. Don’t make the audience wait and don’t be “that guy” who drags out setup extra long as some weirdo passive-aggressive attention seeking move. See previous rule.\nNo matter how big the stage, setup as close to each other as possible. Look and feel like a combined unit of people making music. Trust me, it will be more impressive.\nThe bassist and the drummer should stand next to each other. It’s all about the bass guitar and the kick drum locking in together.\nNever leave the van unattended during load-in or load-out. If you haven’t had your gear stolen at this point, it’s a miracle.\nLead guitar gets the attention, but the bass guitar brings the sex. Flashy medleys get attention, but people feel the bass, no matter how boring.\nDon’t riff stage banter. It’s hard to be witty on the fly unless you are very, very witty. Have some prepared goofs or smalltalk.\nMake friends with the soundboard operator. This person ultimately controls how good you sound and can make or break you.\n“Come forward to the stage” is at best a one-time suggestion. You can’t control people, never ask more than once.",

If you’re a mean person online, it’s the same as being mean in person.\nNo spamming. Conversations are a back and forth.\nIt’s okay to leave the chatroom if you’re uncomfortable.\nHopefully this sets a good foundation for “being online”. It’s earlier than we planned, but with friends’ travel schedules, COVID quarantines, and Texas heat advisories; parent-initiated Zooms and FaceTimes weren’t scaling. We’re now letting the kids self-govern their online hangouts through FaceTime and Messenger Kids. We’ve been conservative about what our kids can do with their devices (time limits, age/content restrictions, parent approval to download/buy, no open chat, etc) and some of those levers will stay in place, but it’s the beginning of a new era.\nThere’s already been some timezone-related 5:00 AM calls made, but hopefully with a bit more nudging around social norms this goes well.",

          "description": "I'm at the point where I am starting to write shaders to do custom effects in WebGL,  such as combining a left and a right image to make an anaglyph image.\nWhat I'm thinking about next is about how to make \"game like\" UIs on the web for desktop and mobile.  Some things that I am inspired by are:\n(1) The Playstation 3 interface https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XrossMediaBar\n(2) Interfaces in video games for viewing a database or documentation about the game world.  I'd like to make something similar but for some part of the real world.\nThe Pokédex from Pokémon is a familiar example but it's not such a good one because Pokémon games mostly run on low-spec handhelds,  so I am thinking more about what you'd see on a PC or TV console games...  But instead of using a game controller you'd be using the touchscreen,  mouse or keyboard.\n(3) However I very much like how games for the Nintendo DS/3DS use the touchscreen such as peeling stickers in Paper Mario Sticker Star and how you can make Luigi fight in the boss battles in Mario and Luigi Dream Team.  So some advanced capability for touch gestures is wanted.\nI'd prefer programming in Javascript,  could accept Typescript but it would be a hard sell if it (say) compiled something else to WebAssembly unless that came with awesome capabilities.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32442496\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Howdy HN! Been working on a side project of mine for about a year called Gloutir. It's essentially an 'agency of one' design and development service using a subscription or retainer model for billing (Stripe + Memberstack).\nI primarily focus on WordPress and Webflow design and development as I realized long ago that there's a huge demand for these services  in the design / marketing agency space.\nI've had a lot of success the past year with this work, and surprisingly (or unsurprisingly) every single client of mine has been a larger agency needing additional help. That kind of makes sense because an agency can immediately see the value in what I offer without really having to be convinced.\nRecently I've introduced a weekly option for clients looking to launch fast and spend less ($1,000 a week, maybe not sustainable but we’ll see). I'd love to get more involved with startups needing landing page work / design services.\nThere are a number of people doing stuff like this, but I do want to clarify that this is never going to be an \"unlimited design\" style subscription service. I've intentionally set a hard cap on the number of clients because it's simply impossible to accommodate more than a certain number of clients while keeping the quality of work where it needs to be.\nAnywho, curious what you all think and if you have any suggestions on how to improve.\nhttps://gloutir.com/\nAbout me: full time designer and developer at an agency. Can see more of my work at https://zchry.org.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32440171\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "Hi! Genie Builder is a free VSCode plugin that makes it easy to build web GUIs for Julia applications (and in future, Python apps too). Users can simply drag & drop UI elements to create interactive dashboards and data apps, without writing any frontend code.\nThe tool is designed for data scientists and researchers who need to expose their data models to business users with an interactive web application, but lack the software development skills to build one.\nGenie Builder completely eliminates the need to learn frontend development to code the UI. And very soon, we’re also going to support one-click cloud deployments to make it easy to build AND deploy data apps - no frontend nor devops skills required.\nI’m Adrian, the creator of the open-source Genie web framework (https://genieframework.com/). Genie offers low-code libraries for building data applications - just like Streamlit or Dash, but for JuliaLang. We developed Genie Builder because of feedback from our open source community who needs more productive data tooling.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32355012\nPoints: 30\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "So, recently i started giving out interviews. I have 7+ years of experience so one or two design rounds are expected. \nKeeping that in mind i revised my concepts on distributed system and read few famous papers on distributed system. it was fun visiting those concepts again.\nAlso, as advised i watched few scaling videos on youtube (i.e Design Uber etc.)\nI have experience building system from scratch and depending upon the requirement i have scaled few services in my organization.\nSo, my expectations from the design round was to have open-ended discussion with interviewer on certain component and discussing drill-down component architecture, scaling issues, drawbacks etc.\nBut For me at least, reality is quite different. I was asked to design BookMyShow ( Movie booking system ) in full. I mean the interviewers expectation was to just draw the components, write the api and design schema. He will understand my work by looking into it.\nI have given 5+ interviews as of now ( got offer from some of them). But i feel like design round wasn't justified.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32353046\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

When you want to discuss tradeoffs of those options who do you talk that over with?\nI am one of two technical cofounders for a small software company. We have really good discussions about the design of our product. I am pretty good at searching. We are comfortable weighing alternatives and making a decision and living with the consequences. All that said, sometimes I want to discuss with other people some of the design challenges we face, or seek input on how people have approached the problem.\nAre there fora that you enjoy for such discussion? It seems that it does not fit with the theme of most Q&A sites. Most IRC channels I know of are pretty focused on their own specific topic.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32331825\nPoints: 148\n# Comments: 101",

All I find is courses that are either too low level with technicalities or top high levels.\nYeah I know there is the data intensive applications I read it and it's not dealing with these specific design decisions its more of 40 k feel look.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32287084\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "TapeMeasure is a utility class, written in Swift, for generating a visual tape measure, or any other graphical elements that need layout in a measured sequence.\nI created this class to help with a pet project I'm working on, where I needed to generate segmented, labeled lines to use as axes on charts and graphs. It occurred to me that this seems to be a pretty common task, involving a lot of boilerplate code and tedious calculations. Why not decouple the code and move it into a dedicated class? It's self-contained, nice and simple, and easy to unit test.\nIt can also handle a lot of tweaks to the \"tape measure\", such as boundary clipping and shifting offsets. It's especially good for animation, where you can just change a parameter or two during animation, and call for the re-calculated data to re-render your measured line. That makes it great for animated sliding and scaling effects.\nAnyway, enjoy!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32279795\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "So here we go, our rebranding is done. New logo, new domain, what could go wrong.\nWe provide a tool to convert design files between Figma, XD, Sketch, Figma, PDF and more and have recently rebranded it from \"XD2Sketch\" to \"Magicul\". We started out as a simple tool to allow users to import XD files in Sketch hence the name XD2Sketch but soon added more features. The name just didn't make sense anymore. Magicul initially seemed to be a great name, but turned out to be a bit of an interesting pick when translated to French.\nWe've sent out a newsletter to our customers to let them know about the changes and here's what one of our users replied:\nHey folks,\nWhile I understand that you guys probably hope to operate primarily in English, I think it needs to be mentioned that your brand name \"Magicul\" in french, literally means \"Magical ass\"... but the real kicker is the .io of the domain, which literally means input & output...\nSo here goes the bad news... The entire french community is reading your brand name - literally - as: Magical ass (dot) in & out.\nAnd then there's the logo itself... which is a hole with a hat.\nChrist. You can't make this stuff up. This is ugh, umm, a brutally unfortunate brand?...lol\nI'm in Quebec, Canada, where french is dominant and so I'm keenly aware of this - and so are my partners, colleagues and friends. We all had a good laugh.\nDon't know what else to say...?\nBonne chance mes amis!\nHave a good one,\n- A fan of your work in Montreal.\nYou can checkout our website here: https://magicul.io\nI just thought this was too hilarious to not share.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32276120\nPoints: 134\n# Comments: 81",

          "description": "I'm still quite early in my career, only at my second SW Dev job. My previous position was a monolith app with arguably poor design resulting in large parts of the app being very tightly coupled when they shouldn't be. Obviously this make testing some parts of the app very difficult  and of course those were the critical parts of them app (our integration test suite took over 24 hours to run at one point).\nWhen I joined my current company they were in the process of breaking down their monolith into micro services which based on my work at my previous position seemed like a much better alternative. After some time here I feel like I'm unsure whether or not micro services are as amazing as they need to be but I'm currently chalking it up to my inexperience with them. It seems like there needs to be a balance of making sure that each service has a limited responsibility while also not having services too interdependent.\nSo basically I would like to learn more about good design practices and pitfalls to avoid. What resources have you guys used to learn more about micro services?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32250823\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hello HN, my name is Chris. My team and I are excited to announce the launch of our new open source UI component library called Skeleton.\nWe've been hard at work for several months and am thrilled to finally pull back the curtain. The goal is to put it out there, let folks go hands on, and gather any feedback we can. If there's bug, a component you would like to see added etc., then we want to know so we can continue to grow and make this better for everyone.\nBeing open source, we welcome any contributions from the community. If you're interested in joining, you can find us on Github:\nhttps://github.com/Brain-Bones/skeleton\nAnd yes, we realize that the combination of Svelte and Tailwind may place us in a niche. Personally speaking, we've had a lot of success with these technologies in the real world. We love what Rich Harris and his team are bringing to the frontend space with Svelte and SvelteKit, and have found Tailwind to be a great boon when creating design systems for web-based apps We're really hoping Skeleton can bridge the gap and provide the best of both worlds, while saving you the time of recreating these components yourself.\nThat's really the biggest benefit of Skeleton - the tight integration between Svelte and Tailwind CSS. It utilizes Tailwind’s utility classes to customize and extend the look and feel of each component. Then pairs this with Svelte’s awesome component architecture. This allows you to create customized, responsive, and reactive interfaces with surprisingly minimal effort.\nOf course, feel free to try it out for yourself. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm excited to see what everyone can produce with Skeleton!\nThanks!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32242781\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

We’re excited to share what we’ve been working on, the Lumina Desk (https://getlumina.com/desk).\nLast January, we founded Lumina with the mission of building the next-generation workspace.\nWe started off by launching a product called the Lumina Webcam, essentially a modern webcam that uses software to make you look good.\nBuilding hardware is hard, and it’s been no different for us. We ran an Indiegogo campaign in September that raised ~$700k, scrambled to figure out hardware production (encountering every obstacle you can imagine - customs, supplier issues, parts incompatibilities), and chewed through enough glass in order to start shipping in December.

In this writing, I have taken concepts from rank oriented forums like Reddit and Hacker News, but incorporated them with RSS to make something free of biased algorithms. I believe this could give users not just a personal reader for themselves, but one that allows users to connect through comments and relational feeds. Ones that display feeds by what all users of an instance follow and feeds among multiple instances of this platform design.\nHow the main feed ranking works\nEvery user has their own personal subscription list of RSS feeds.

          "description": "Productivity timers needed to be triggered manually before each task, Making it a chore by itself, Often leading to us not using them after a while and They don't take health into consideration.\nHealth timers are intrusive, Even then they are not always accurate and They don't take productivity into consideration.\nButt Mover addresses those problems by using a butt trigger for automatically starting the productivity timer when we sit on the chair before our workstation and a break timer which reminds us to take a walk automatically when we get up.\nButt Mover also incentivizes its usage through a Game. When the health(tasks/breaks) reaches zero its game over.\nI've been iterating different forms of Butt Mover over past two years and released the web application earlier this year(After feedback from several HN users). Today I'm making the core application open-source as I've committed myself to make the Health & Education applications I build open-source.\nI hope you'd use Butt Mover for yourself and build Butt Trigger for others to improve productivity and health. Feedback and contributions to improve the project is appreciated.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32346878\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "It seems obvious to me that something like RSS would make a great events publication format, and I'm wondering if anyone has already thought of this.\nSay I would like to follow the events of my local art gallery and the local gigs of a certain musician. The gallery and musician could put out a feed which I could follow, with values including date-time, address, info-url, ticket-url, details. My event-feed reader would pull in the gallery's and musician's events from their website, and populate a calendar with them. Moreover, I could set the reader to only display events in the region I care about, so the only gigs of the musician that would appear would be the ones when they come to my town.\nThey seems a simple, decentralised way of following events, but I'm surprised nothing like this already exists?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32304474\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Recently I was reading about fluid simulation and stumbled upon the Gauss Seidel method. I got interested in how it works and made a program that visualizes the method in action.\nI had the idea of making an interactive book-like thing for a while, so took this as a chance to do just that.\nNote that touch input doesn't work and the layout is targeted towards bigger screens, so it doesn't function properly on mobile.\nIt was fun to make and I wanted to share it. Maybe someone will find it useful. Corrections and feedback are welcome.\nTechnical Stuff\n- A single 1.7MB HTML file with embedded JavaScript and WebAssembly. You can save this single file and double click it to run.\n- A math typesetter from scratch in C that compiles/renders the equations in real-time (uses KaTex fonts and STB true type to rasterize the fonts).\n- Platform code is done using Sokol (tested on windows and web).\n- The UI is done using Dear ImGui (Most of the code is done in C++ to use ImGui without a wrapper except for the equations compiler).\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32371246\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hello HN, my name is Chris. My team and I are excited to announce the launch of our new open source UI component library called Skeleton.\nWe've been hard at work for several months and am thrilled to finally pull back the curtain. The goal is to put it out there, let folks go hands on, and gather any feedback we can. If there's bug, a component you would like to see added etc., then we want to know so we can continue to grow and make this better for everyone.\nBeing open source, we welcome any contributions from the community. If you're interested in joining, you can find us on Github:\nhttps://github.com/Brain-Bones/skeleton\nAnd yes, we realize that the combination of Svelte and Tailwind may place us in a niche. Personally speaking, we've had a lot of success with these technologies in the real world. We love what Rich Harris and his team are bringing to the frontend space with Svelte and SvelteKit, and have found Tailwind to be a great boon when creating design systems for web-based apps We're really hoping Skeleton can bridge the gap and provide the best of both worlds, while saving you the time of recreating these components yourself.\nThat's really the biggest benefit of Skeleton - the tight integration between Svelte and Tailwind CSS. It utilizes Tailwind’s utility classes to customize and extend the look and feel of each component. Then pairs this with Svelte’s awesome component architecture. This allows you to create customized, responsive, and reactive interfaces with surprisingly minimal effort.\nOf course, feel free to try it out for yourself. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm excited to see what everyone can produce with Skeleton!\nThanks!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32242781\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

I aimed the site to be for people like me, so no telemetry and minimal JS was the goal. I know this is rather small and incomplete compared to other projects but I've thought you folk might be interested.\nNot sure if it breaks the pure part, but the site also uses Flask.\nIf you're lucky, you might find the app alive at: https://formie.div72.xyz.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32193896\nPoints: 16\n# Comments: 13",

It adapts to your preferred design tools, tech stack, and workflows with ease and lets you launch upto 4x faster, while letting designers design the way they want and giving high-quality responsive code that developers love.\nWith this launch, you can convert your Figma designs into React, React Native, Next.js, Gatsby, and HTML-CSS code. You get a live-responsive prototype that runs on code (we call these ‘real-fidelity prototypes’) and when good to go, you can either export the code to build on top of it or directly deploy to Netlify, Vercel, or Github.\nToday, we have also launched on Product Hunt. Let us know your thoughts and suggestions: https://www.producthunt.com/posts/locofy-ai.\nOur team will be answering all your questions!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32135638\nPoints: 6\n# Comments: 2",
