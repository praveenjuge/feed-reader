Twitter was never without its problems, but the consequences of it being run by an actual psychopath are already being felt. I was reluctant to have yet another social network to manage, but witnessing the mass exodus from Twitter of so many of the people I care about hearing from has led to my feed no longer feeling like the place it once was, as those voices gradually disappear.

          "description": "I was reading about Akira the other day and stumbled across an interesting casual fact:\nPainstakingly animated by hand, the care that went into Akira can be seen in every frame; there’s 327 different colour shades in the film, 50 of which were invented for it.\nFifty colors! Invented! An incredulous claim, but here’s a clip from a contemporaneous behind-the-scenes VHS documentary of Akria explaining the situation with the invented colors.\n\nTo accommodate the dark themes of the film and the five-stage variations of character shading, they added 50 shades of color to the commonly-used animation color palette. You can see the physical color palette in a couple places in the clip.\nKimie Yamana adding more… ahem… color… to the topic.\nIf you look at the color chart you’ll see the tremendous variety of dark tones. Many colors you wouldn’t see in other animation. There’s such subtlety in the various tones, you wouldn’t notice them on a television screen. But in the theater the large variety of colors really makes a difference.\nAdding more, almost imperceptible, tones to the color palette allowed the neon-noir setting of a cyberpunk Neo Tokyo to thrive. Light plays a major role in the film and the use of color allowed the city itself to come alive as a character. A shadowy city that has light, life, and explosions.\nImpressive. If you watch the whole behind the scenes video, you get a sense of the massive undertaking that was Akira. Blockbuster budgets and all the big name studios pitching in to make something bigger than themselves. Something timeless. Something breathtaking.",

          "description": "Dragon’s Heaven is an eccentric anime directed by Makoto Hashimoto that —after hearing about it— I instantly dropped everything to watch it. It’s a giant robot mech anime with a Mœbius-”inspired” aesthetic. Actually, it’s a 100% rip-off of Mœbius, but it’s so well executed it stands on its own as something uniquely original (in a “great artists steal” kind of way). All the sand blowing and dimpled grunge effects that characterize Mœbius’s work were done by hand frame by frame… it’s a stunning work of art.\nThe sci-fi stands on its own as well. It’s the story of Ikuru, a girl in the year 3195 who awakens a robot named Shaian who has been dormant for 1,000 years. Shaian deactivated itself after a battle when its human copilot was killed in action. Shaian soon discovers his nemesis is still operational and doing battle in Brazil. It’s a Machines vs. Machines+Humans story with an assertive female protagonist. It makes you think about the relationships between humans and machines; will it be symbiotic or authoritarian? Also the notion that machines will outlive their human counterparts by millennia and hold on to centuries-long beef is interesting to think about as we feed machines with our biases in the present day.\nBut that’s not all! It gets weirder (beyond the awkward robot-human innuendo). The film is sandwiched between a poorly shot, ultra-smokey practical effects title sequence on the frontside and a documentary of how the director himself made the title sequence on the backside. It has the vibe of a gritty 1980s behind-the-scenes (like Alien or Star Wars) but also the air that no one could tell Hashimoto “No, this model thing isn’t good.” Some human quirks wrapped up in a film about two embattled robots.\nIf you’re curious about something called “Dragon’s Heaven” but has very little to do with actual dragons, I recommend it on the artwork alone. Feel free to skip all the non-anime parts.",

          "description": "One of our family pandemic purchases was an electronic piano, a Yamaha P-121. My son was showing interest in music and we thought we’d be good parents and nurture that. His interest waned fast (read: in minutes), but I still play it! I grew up with a piano in the house so I’ve always been able to noodle, and I took a class in college, but I’ve never been able to fluently read sheet music enough to enjoy playing the piano. That is until I found E-Z Play Today music books1.\n\nE-Z Play Today music books are beginner level books that take the mystery out of musical notation. Each note gets its corresponding letter inside it, no stacked notes, and bass chords written in a boxes above the staff. It’s guitar tabs but for piano and I love it.\nAre they the exact notes? No.\nAre the melodies just single notes? Yes.\nDoes it help me learn musical notation? Maybe.\nAre almost all the songs transposed to the Key of C so they’re easier to play? Yes.\nE-Z Play Today meets me where I am. It’s almost exactly what I want out of a song book; “Here’s the minimum viable version of this well-known song.” I have no dreams of becoming a concert pianist, I just want to enjoy playing the piano without feeling illiterate and uncoordinated. My left hand is playing a melody and my right hand is holding down a chord. Easy.\nAs dumbed down as this may be, I’m enjoying the approach and there’s a wide variety of genres and artists in their collection. I’m sure I’ll buy more. I broke out the Christmas song book in November and it’s been a small bit of joy to fill the house with some holiday spirit.\nNever change this website please. ↩",

I love this video because it reminds me of simpler times where we watched idle videos on the internet all day instead of the staring in abject horror at the endless timeline. A single man knocking down a silo, what a metaphor for our current times! The silo falling also reminds me of an old Texan-ism by former Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn:\nAny jackass can kick a barn down, but it took a carpenter to build it.\nNow we are barn-less. Silo-less. Wandering open pastures for the next watering hole.\nWherever you end up I want to offer an idea; you are the value.

          "description": "In recent weeks, a handful of people asked me what’s been happening in Web Components Land. Well, as President of Web Components, I have good news and the state of Web Components is pretty strong right now.\nI did my Frontend Masters course on Web Components in April and since then there’s even more positive momentum happening in the Web Components space. Here’s a high-level list of developments over the last 6 months or so:\nAccording to the 2022 Jamstack Survey “Web Components have arrived” (jamstack.org)\nBrad Frost talks about web components (bradfrost.com)\nSafari is prototyping Declarative Shadow DOM (github.com)\nElement Internals is under development in Safari (github.com)\nWebkit turned on Constructable/Adopted Stylesheets (github.com)\nEleventy introduced WebC … which isn’t capital-”WC” Web Components, but shares a similar ethos\nEnhance.dev is a whole framework built on web components\nWeb Components Community Group collected their list of top concerns for TPAC\nExciting times. When I filmed my course, these more advanced Web Component concepts (Declarative Shadow DOM, Element Internals, Adopted Stylesheets, etc) were a smidge depressing to talk about because of their unknown Safari status. I could say the technology existed, but provide no roadmap for when it would get better support. But, if I’m reading these standards positions right, hopefully the consumer branch of Safari will support them soon.\nOn top of more feature support, more tooling is also great news for Web Components. Alternate takes, different ideas, varied perspectives! While it can cause some confusion when navigating the Web Component waters, the more perspectives the better for these little building blocks.\nWatch my Frontend Masters Course",

This allows sites\nto build easy sign-in experiences that are more secure.\n# What is a passkey?\nA passkey is a digital credential, tied to a user account and a website or application. Passkeys are more secure than\npasswords because they enable users to sign in to apps and websites with a\nbiometric sensor (such as a fingerprint or facial recognition), PIN, or pattern,\nfreeing them from having to remember and manage passwords. Because they are\nWebAuthn credentials, they include the\nfollowing security features:\nPasskeys use public-key cryptography so sites don't have to store passwords or secrets.\nUsers can't be phished because a passkey can only be used with the website or app that created it.\nWebsites could create and use WebAuthn credentials on devices and\nsecurity keys via a modal UI in the browser. To do so, websites had to\nredesign their sign-in flow to let users select the WebAuthn flow using a\nseparate button. By allowing passkeys to enable autofill, websites can now\nprovide the same experience for both password and passkey users.\n# Conditional UI\nAllowing websites to make a WebAuthn request without triggering the modal UI is\ncalled \"conditional mediation\". This autofill integration is often referred to\nas a conditional\nUI.\n          \n  A user signing in with a condtional UI\n\n# How it works\nAs soon as the user taps on the username input field, an autofill suggestion\ndialog pops up with the stored passkeys and password autofill suggestions. The\nuser can then choose an account and use the device screen lock to sign in. This\nenables users to sign in to the website with the existing password form as if\nnothing has changed, but with the added security benefit of\npasskeys.\n# How to use conditional UI\nTo use the WebAuthn conditional UI, learn how to Create a passkey for\npasswordless logins and Sign in with a\npasskey through form autofill.\nPhoto by Scott Graham on Unsplash",

          "description": "Genuine question: if one were to architect a web app to use disk for storage, rather than a database, how would one do it?\nLately, there's been a lot of buzz about SQLite, and I myself have been impressed with DuckDB. I've also found myself doing my prototyping using plain JSON files on disk, and then \"productionizing\" to use a database when I need to deploy.\nSo: suppose I wanted to be able to have multiple web servers - it's nice to be able to create more servers as needed - read and write data to a disk. What would one do? What's the easiest way to share files across multiple servers? How do you ensure you have enough disk? Or partition traffic?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33754038\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I am willing to bet (inflation-adjusted) 1000$ that in the next decade, multiple teams will see the advent of Wasm and WebGPU as a perfect reason to have yet another go at a cross-plattform UI framework. These projects will claim to have \"native\" UI elements, but it will be obvious that the are really just rebuilding everything to look like the native counterparts (similar to Flutter). Especially on macOS and iOS, major interactions will be unsupported or implemented in wrong ways (problems will likely occur around the menu bar, keyboard navigation, and integration with OS services). Scrolling will feel off on touchscreen devices and text rendering will differ from the native look. Still, some of these frameworks will have tens of thousands of stars on GitHub and be used by major companies. I would not be surprised if these frameworks were built with Rust and be seen by many as the thing that would finally bring Rust to the mainstream. I see it as likely that in whatever language these frameworks will be written, they will introduce some weird new syntax and paradigms to accomodate a more \"intuitive\" (probably declarative) style of writing UI code. Meanwhile, little to no progress will be made developing techniques and frameworks to build apps that are actually better for the end user.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33730173\nPoints: 27\n# Comments: 11",

There are online lists of peoples favorite SID music, and online players, see [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]. Because I have different tastes, I had the motivation to make my own list and UX. So from january 2020 to september 2022, I listened through the HVSC having over 50k songs, resulting in a list of 600-700 favorites. I put together a UX so I can easily access them. This project is mostly for my own enjoyment, but I guess that many others here would also enjoy it.

          "description": "Hey all. I don't know how many designers are here, but I'm currently in a bit of a pickle and would like some advice.\nI am a recent college graduate that has been trusted with running the design team at a startup. I've been hired as a full-time UX designer and am currently leading a team of three design interns. I have no real experience running a design team, and am wondering how I should best proceed in managing the team. Things have been pretty disorganized, and we recently had a meeting in which most of our time was spent in pretty unproductive disagreement. As the person who is more or less running the design team I feel totally responsible for this, and would like to know how I could best run meetings and assign tasks in order to generate lots of ideas, while making sure discussion stays productive come decision making time. I'd also appreciate any tips on how to facilitate healthy discussion when discussing differences in opinions. I'm really new to all of this and a bit out of my element, but I really want to do my best and would appreciate any advice.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33616047\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 3",

No reading, searching, user profiles, or any other feature.\n+ Users too just want it to post. We can assume many users don't want any apps - including this one - to routinely examine their user profiles, followers, or protected memberships on the platform.\n+ However - and here's the problem IMO - the API's /post endpoint forces the app to have \"read readuser post\" scopes just to call this post-only API. (\"Scopes\" are OAuth terminology for broad permissions).\nWhy I think this is bad design:\n+ The API fails to differentiate between external access and internal  access.

We've recently hired a new development team, and I'd like to learn more technical skills in order to really understand the development side of the product, as well as to communicate ideas better and to understand our design constraints. I have a little bit of coding experience from school and am using some online tools to learn CSS/HTML/Javascript. I'm also using some online resources to learn about software architecture. Is this the best way to go about this? What would be some good resources for me to learn this skills?

          "description": "Hi, I’m the technical founder of OneGen. I've been a software engineer for over a decade, but it wasn't until the pandemic that I decided to take a leap of faith and build an innovative solution to designing data models.\nMost applications & SDKs support more than one platform. And for each platform, software engineers write and maintain the same (or similar) data models.\nI thought that if I could design data models completely independent of a database or a programming language in a way that allows versioning and collaboration and then generate the model code for whatever the technology stack is, it would be pretty cool.\nOneGen doesn't work as a one-time code generator. Instead, you design and continuously maintain your data models right inside the app to achieve a single source of truth.\nWe're excited to announce our free beta release to you.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33533340\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

The goal is to make interior design easy and fun, like playing with Lego.\nIt started off as an app to simulate housing in an MMORPG, since the furniture system there was atrocious. I'm now trying to adapt it as a simulator for general interior design.\nLike many 3D design software, there are a bunch of tools and controls, and first-time users may feel somewhat lost. So I've made a starting tutorial to help ease users into the controls. Do you think the tutorial works well?\nLet me know what else can be improved!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33468495\nPoints: 14\n# Comments: 5",

          "description": "My news diet consists of the following:\n* email newsletters (substack)\n* selected articles (a lot from Hackernews)\n* I also subscribe to some promotional newsletters (events, certain products). Not sure how I would fit these\nHowever, I have been struggling with keeping my inbox clean and readable with the newsletters and am considering to switch to an RSS reader. I have several criteria:\n1. I need to be able to add one-off articles to the reader (such as finding an interesting article on Hackernews for later consumption).\n2. I would love to be able to add rules. For example, if I don't read an article for several days, I would like it to disappear from my inbox (archived) or be marked as read so it doesn't clog my reading.\n3. Needs to be accessible on computer (web/app) and  mobile (ideally via app).\nWould love to hear how other people manage this. I'm also happy to pay for a good solution here.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33613354\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 8",

Not only this, they also change the status on Discord, Slack, Telegram and many other apps.\nThis is a Growth Hack for them but this was very frustrating for me to know and especially they don't have any authority over my WhatsApp Status.\nWhen I did some reverse engineering, I found SideKick is adding an extension that injects content script on web.whatsapp.com and it changes the WhatsApp status automatically every 3 days or so and then they also send the analytics events to their servers.\nThey may/may not be doing anything with my data but the bigger question is when people over Internet are using browsers like these, they get full access to what you browse and everything else like Cookies, Passwords, etc.\nEven they can stitch your sessions in Incognito if they want in the backend \\_(~_~)_/. Who knows.\nBrowser extensions are still vetted by respective vendors like Google & Mozilla but how do we ensure we are browsing the Internet safely?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33606176\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Web crawling in this day and age is loaded with caveats, and must be done carefully as to not put an unnecessary load on other people's infrastructure. I'd really like to try to make my own web search tool, so I'm trying to scope out something simple enough to get me started. Here's what I have so far.\n- I don't want to parse anything in the SimilarWeb Top 50.\n- I don't want to render JS\n- I'd like to keep a web index that is still measured in TBs\nI've done search engines for research papers in the past. The key difference was that I could collect that data very easily through a documented API. Now I need to either build or use a crawler and I'm not sure where to begin. Here are some thoughts that I have so far.\n- I'm probably going to write the crawler in Go. It seems like a good fit for this sort of software.\n- How do I start collecting lists of domains? Do I just start hitting public IPv4 addresses on Ports 80 and 443?\n- If I run something like this with proper rate limiting on a server, would Cloudflare inevitably just start blocking me?\n- If I were to run this from a machine connected to the Internet via a residential ISP, then would I get a nasty letter from my ISP?\nAny advice or feedback is appreciated. The goal of this project is to learn more about web crawling moreso than to build a product that would be sold.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33824222\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

It also tries to validate the selector expressions before running the parsing.

          "description": "Coming from WPF and Winform, I find web development to be unnecessarily complex, but I refuse to believe that’s true.\nI just want to make a simple web app, no React, Angular or any of that. That can’t be too hard right? I’m sure in large scale, that stuff has its place, but I don’t need it. To me, the browser is the UI framework.\nWhen I Google around to get started, I find obnoxious Medium articles. I don’t want to copy and paste instructions and throw something together without a clue what’s going on. Mozilla has good documentation, but I don’t know what’s a good source to actually get a web app running locally that I can eventually deploy online. Do I really need Node? Compared to WPF/Winform this is a mess, or so I hope not.\nI want to make a simple app where users can create and fill out a form. ATC test plans, to be exact.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33635218\nPoints: 170\n# Comments: 166",

          "description": "I'm scraping information regarding civil servants' calendars. This is all public, text-only information. I'd like to keep a copy of the raw HTML files I'm scraping for historical purposes, and also in case there's a bug and I need to re-run the scrapers.\nThis sounds like a great usage for a forward proxy like Squid or Apache Traffic Server. However, I couldn't find in their docs a way to both:\n* Keep a permanent history of the cached pages\n* Access old versions of the cached pages (think Wayback Machine)\nDoes anyone know if this is possible? I could potentially mirror the pages using wget or httrack, but a forward cache is a better solution as the caching process is driven by the scraper itself.\nThanks!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33563016\nPoints: 23\n# Comments: 16",

          "description": "Hi folks, I've been working on a visual devtool chrome extension for Tailwind CSS for quite some time now and just launched in recently.\nIt let's you tweak your website from the browser itself   and copy the classes or html afterwards to paste in your IDE. It's especially well suited to try out changes quickly, but I've built most of the landing page with the help of the extension itself.\nYou can try it out in the landing page itself (no need to install anything).\nFeatures:\n- Click on any class (eg: px-4) and try out other values easily.\n-  Preview the website in responsive mode and quickly toggle between breakpoints. auto detects breakpoints set in the config.\n- Quickly try out new variants. Supports arbitrary variants too.\n- Lets you try out arbitrary and negative property values.\n- Add, remove or re-order elements.\n- Edit element attributes and text nodes\netc.\nI'm excited to share it here and would love to hear your feedback and suggestions.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33534806\nPoints: 7\n# Comments: 0",

It’s nice to see how web development evolves, cross-browser support is great for most of the things and we can focus on building great experiences. The result is for example Mastodon, a communication service built on web standard protocols, independent of big tech companies. Or Pixelfed, or PHP, the language that drives most of our server software. Web Components finally get some traction as more and more vendors of widgets build libraries around it. Thanks to all who help the web standards evolving, who help other people by creating open source solutions, to those who write how-to-use articles and to those who share them. Enjoy this week…",
