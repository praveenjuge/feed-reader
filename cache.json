          "description": "Starting with Chrome 114, the Chrome team is reducing the time between the branch for a release, and the actual release to stable. The aim is to shorten the time it takes to launch, and reduce merges.\nThis will not change the release date for Chrome stable or early stable. It will, however, align the beta release date across platforms. Before Chrome 114, the iOS release went to beta a week before the Desktop and Android releases.\nThe following table shows how this change affects the 114 release.\nStage\n      Chrome 114 (Old)\n      Chrome 114 (Revised)\n    \nFeature Freeze\n      Thu, Apr 6\n      Tue, Apr 11\n    \nBranch \n      Thu, Apr 20\n      Tue, Apr 25\n    \nBeta Promotion\n      Thu, May 4\n      Wed, May 3\n    \nBeta Promotion (iOS)\n      Wed, Apr 26\n      Wed, May 3\n    \nStable Cut\n      Tue, May 23\n      Tue, May 23\n    \nStable Cut (iOS)\n      Tue, May 16\n      Tue, May 23\n    \nEarly Stable Release\n      Wed, May 24\n      Wed, May 24\n    \nStable Release\n      Tue, May 30\n      Tue, May 30\n    \nNote that Chrome 115 stable will be delayed for two weeks to accommodate the July release freeze, all dates after this have been adjusted to account for the two week delay.\nYou can keep track of upcoming releases on the Chrome Status Roadmap, and see the schedule in detail on the Chromium Dashboard. We publish a post on this site for each beta release, so you can keep track of upcoming changes to Chrome.\nHero image by Caleb George.",

          "description": "At work, we recently discussed the issues arising from UX/UI designers using visual tools like Figma or Sketch to create mockups that front-end developers have to manually reverse-engineer into HTML/CSS. While these tools provide useful means of visual expression, they often lead to developers having to infer design vocabulary from the mockups themselves, causing a loss of value and potential misinterpretations.\nAs a community, how can we bridge the gap between visual and text-based web design to preserve design reasoning and intent? Are there better ways to communicate design requirements without relying solely on visual mockups? How can we emphasize the importance of a clear connection between description and visual presentation in modern web design tools to avoid costly mistakes and improve accessibility?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35386850\nPoints: 7\n# Comments: 5",

Here’s a video: https://player.vimeo.com/video/797476910.\nGetting from a product idea to a design is too hard. Wireframing tools (e.g. Balsamiq) are limited and their output is too low-fidelity to get people excited about the idea. On the other hand, high-fidelity design tools (e.g. Figma) require advanced skills and are better for tweaking fine details than hashing out a big picture. Meanwhile, companies have an insatiable need to make new screens and change existing ones, and hiring more designers is time-consuming and expensive.\nDavid and I were on the design tools team at Airbnb when we realized there’s another solution: let designers encode their knowledge (e.g. design rules …",

          "description": "Hi HN, I'm Chun Rapeepat.\nLast week I started playing with GPT-4 and tried different ways to use it to optimize my dev workflow. It was fun, and I was just blown away by what GPT-4 can do.\nThe idea of CodePrompt first came to mind when I read \"Show HN: GPT Repo Loader – load entire code repos into GPT prompts\" [1]. It was precisely what I wanted to do! So I tried it.\nThe GPT Repo Loader works pretty well on a small codebase; However, due to its limitations in loading all files and content into the prompt, I still ran into token context limit issues and needed to copy/edit the code myself.\nThat's when I started working on CodePrompt. Instead of loading the entire repo, why not just load only relevant files or portions of code (or function headers?) that need for the requirement?\nHow I designed the user journey of CodePrompt.xyz:\n1. Choose a GPT model.\n2. Select a repo that you want to work with.\n3. Pick the relevant files that you want to include in the prompt.\n4. Add specific instructions and remove irrelevant codes as needed.\n5. Copy the prompt to your chosen GPT model to generate the desired output. Chat & Iterate.\n6. If you want to do something else, just go to (3) again.\nThis allows me to easily generate prompts to do something like \n- Implement features that evolve edits on multiple files\n- Create new components while reusing existing codebase\n- Generate code with the same style as other files, etc.\nI would love to hear all your feedback and ideas on how I can improve it. Or if you want to chat, feel free to ping me on my Twitter @chunrapeepat.\nP.S. The project is 100% open-source and free to use. \nCheck it out: https://github.com/chunrapeepat/codeprompt\n[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35191303\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35370579\nPoints: 5\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "I am interested in knowing how a bidding system works from a system design perspective.  I haven't been able to find a detail design for this.  There are a couple of challenges that I can think of:\n- many bidders for a specific item requiring multiple nodes\n- accepting a bid is a transaction?\n- ordering of bids as they come in\n- invalidating bids once and reflecting that to a customer very quickly\nUsually systems that are distributed that also need to be fast choose eventual consistency, but I am not sure how that would work in a bidding environment.  Any detailed resources (papers, blog posts, videos etc...) that I can review?  Thanks!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35342855\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "I'm thrilled to share with you all a personal milestone in my life that I feel compelled to celebrate. My girlfriend, Julia, has been pursuing her dream of becoming a UX/UI designer for almost a year now while working in logistics, and today she has finally published her first project!\nI can't express how proud I am of her for putting in the hard work to make her dream a reality. It's not easy to balance work and study (you know, sleepless nights to chase a dream), but she has done it with great determination.\nNow that Julia has completed her first project, she's excited to take the next step in her journey and is actively searching for job opportunities in UX/UI design. If any of you have any leads or know of any open positions in this field, we would be immensely grateful for any advice or guidance you can offer.\nI know some of you may think it's a small feat, but to us, it's a significant accomplishment worth toasting. As a community of innovators and dreamers, I hope we can all take inspiration from Julia's story and strive to follow our passions relentlessly.\nLet's raise a glass to Julia and all the aspiring designers out there who are working hard to turn their dreams into reality. Cheers!\nHer project published on Behance: https://www.behance.net/gallery/166920067/TagPalette-UXUI-Design\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35320207\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "What’s the current state and future of work-from-anywhere, productivity devices for someone with poor vision?\nI’m not talking about answering emails at the coffee shop with a laptop. I’m talking about hanging off a glacier in the sun, writing code.\nAnd by poor vision, I mean, corrected, I can just about read a newspaper in poor lighting. I can’t see your laptop over your shoulder. You’ll need to jack up the font size, thanks. I’ve never understood shiny screens, it’s like a mirror to me.\nI’m not worried about power supply, yet. The current state of batteries should be fine.\nAlso connectivity is not a problem, yet. I’ll tether my phone, or use some satellite service.\nI appreciate that this is idealistic but bear with me. My dream life scenario is that I’m on some physical adventure/expedition, and suddenly we need some code to save our lives. (Anyone do this?)\nSo I need terminals, IDE’s, connectivity, text and voice based communication, GPT. All the good stuff. I don’t need high resolution or photo/video editing, yet.\nLess ambitiously and more realistically, I’d like to work in my back garden when the sun is out.\nI’ve always been on the fence about keyboards. I don’t like the rigid posture required but I have adapted to become an efficient user of this tool. And fixing the keyboard to the tiny screen (classic laptop) makes it worse. I’ve always thought we can do better.\nAm I just looking for a rugged E-ink tablet?\nI should also add, I’m super optimistic and re-energised about where the tech is headed with E-ink for displays and GPT for productivity. The opportunities feel liberating.\nThanks\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35599057\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hi everyone!\nAron (@arondeparon) here, founder of Gistreader.com.\nI was an avid user of Google Reader back in the day, but for some reason, I silently rolled over when they decided to kill it and never looked at RSS again.\nLately, I am getting more and more frustrated by the fact that most of the content that I consume is being pushed at me by some kind of algorithm. I wanted more control over this process, so decided to build GistReader.\nIn its basic form, GistReader is an RSS reader that aims to make your reading experience as fast and pleasant as possible. In addition to that, it uses AI to automatically create summaries of your articles and uses text-to-speech to optionally read a condensed version of an article to you out loud.\nGistReader is my first-ever product launch, so as you might expect, I'm pretty nervous about that, especially when it comes to sharing it on HN :)\nPlease, feel free to let me know what you think. It's all very early-days (lots of things I want to fix/improve/build) and the only way I can improve is by getting solid feedback from people that might actually use it.\nThanks!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35516274\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I ask this because so often I see people recommending tools and techniques by saying things like \"this dramatically increased my productivity!\" or \"this sped up my workflow by an order of magnitude!\"\nHow can we take such claims seriously? Most things do not improve our productivity THAT much. However, some things truly do.\nLet me give some examples of things I think truly have \"dramatically improved\" my productivity.\n  - testing, specifically integration tests\n  - memory safety (garbage collection, borrow checker, etc.)\n  - version control (git, etc.)\n  - closures and lambdas\n  - unix pipes and the idea of composing larger programs out of smaller ones\n  - Chrome debugger when working with javascript\n    - I hesitate to say \"debuggers\" in general because I actually think GDB didn't \"dramatically\" improve my productivity back when I programmed in C. And I don't even use a debugger at all when I program in python. But the Chrome debugger has numerous features I use all the time.\n\n  - static type systems\n    - could be a small win but I don't find myself \"dramatically more productive\"\n  - TDD\n  - IDEs\n    - some IDEs are better than others, but I have yet to experience a dramatic increase in productivity simply by using a new IDE. Text editor + terminal is pretty strong tbh.\n  - serverless architecture\n    - I could see the argument for scaling concerns, but at a smaller scale I don't see a productivity boost compared to a monolith Rails/Django app\n  - classes and class-style OOP, inheritance\n    - I haven't written a class in a long time, and I haven't used inheritance in a REALLY long time. I just don't think these are huge wins in most cases. Note that I'm not even advocating for FP here. I program in a procedural style most of the time in all honesty.\n\nThanks! I look forward to seeing the replies.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35350969\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "Hi, I've been playing around with doc2.site which uses Google Docs to create web pages. I tried several Chat GPT plugins to enhance my doc content with semantics like headings, emphasised text etc.\nThe problem is I always get plain text responses from Chat GPT (and plugins) even if you ask for the HTML output and then if you copy paste the output into Google Docs, you get the HTML tags like \nblah\n.I found a script that does copy the output as HTML:\n\"const blob = new Blob([html], {type: 'text/html'});\" so it's super easy actually but I couldn't find a plugin that handles it nicely like a copy paste response as HTML button.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35449723\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

There was also some gunk inside the device, which again, just needed cleaning.\nThe touch screen, after testing, was fine too. Maybe it was the ribbon that needed re-seating, and I did completely take the DS Lite apart and re-shell it (originally it was red with a LOT of stickers) - I feel like the re-shell has a bit of a Star Wars dark side vibe!",

But in future, there's easier contact points to jump to.\nOtherwise, now all the buttons work, and TIL: mash the shoulder buttons can equate to a totalled joycon!",

Originally I wanted to swap all the parts to a new PCB, but that requires actually purchasing another Pokémon Crystal (which sell for around £20-30) - which didn't make sense.\nUltimately I cleaned as much as I could under the pad and then used solder mask to secure the gold finger down and now it's secure and safe for a good many years of usage.

And unlike heftier legacy frameworks like React, when you need to add interactivity they can still be extremely lightweight by leveraging (dare I say it…) The Platform™ *audible gasp*.\nBut let’s not get distracted from the task at hand: we want to evaluate a few different options on the table to apply styles (CSS) to our web components.\nHere are the things we want to think about:\nEncapsulation.

SPA advocates have rebranded this architecture as a Multi-Page Application (MPA) but fundamentally this is how the web has always operated.\nClassic multi-page architecture has a few benefits:\nBetter empty-cache performance: your site can render faster.\n\nAs web browsers become more privacy-focused and users spread their browsing across multiple web-capable devices, empty-caches visits are increasingly common.\nFaster sites make more money.
