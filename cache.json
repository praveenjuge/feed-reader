The reasoning goes that many web applications are intentionally built more like native apps than like websites, prioritizing efficiency during lengthy browsing sessions after the web app is already open rather than optimizing for a first visit.\nWhile I would argue that site delivery optimizations should not need to conflict with post-load optimizations (...and wonder if users carry their low performance expectations of native app startup time over to the web anyway), it is true that these represent different moments in user experience and need to be measured differently.

When JS reliance is minimal, fixing poor delivery performance can be as simple as instructing the browser to load certain scripts at a lower priority and allow HTML content to render sooner. But when a site is dependent on JavaScript for generating its HTML content in the first place, those sorts of optimizations can’t help, and in those cases fixing the problem may require deep and time-consuming architectural changes.\nWhile it has been around longer, the pa…",

          "description": "Last week I had the privilege of participating in Smashing Conference in Freiburg. One of the standout sessions was from Asim Hussain, of the Green Software Foundation, who talked about what a Net-Zero strategy means for organisations building websites. It was interesting to hear about the challenges of measuring the carbon emissions of a website, and the many different aspects that must be considered while doing so.\nAsim pointed out that offsets are not an effective way of getting to Net-Zero, which might seem controversial to some, given that many companies that claim to be carbon neutral are at least partly counting carbon offsetting towards that goal.

This is a pretty smart way to go about writing robust CSS that caters for users with a whole range of browsers and devices with different capabilities, and is infinitely preferable to user agent sniffing. We can check whether a browser supports aspect-ratio, say, and provide a fallback in cases where lack of support would hamper the user experience.\n.some-element {\n  max-height: 200px;\n}\n@supports (aspect-ratio: 1) {\n  .some-element {\n    aspect-ratio: 1;\n    max-height: none;\n  }\n}\nThis particular block of code sets a max-height on an element, except when aspect-ratio is supported, when we’ll use that instead.\nWe could make this a bit more concis…",

Cruising through the archives, I found a translation of a 1989 issue of BEEP magazine which features one of my favorite sources of inspiration: Shigeru Miyamoto, creator of Mario.\nWhen asked “What’s the secret to success in the game industry?” he had this to say:\nWell, what’s worked for me so far is finding something I want to make that matches up with what the market currently needs.\nIf you believe in your idea, and that it’s something people will want, then all that remains is for you to polish and raise it to a sufficient level of quality. So no matter how talented of a staff you’ve been blessed with, if you don’t have a clear direction for your idea, I don’t think a good game will come out of it. The goal is for each staff member, individually, to contribute to the overall “finish” of the work, so it’s just a matter of having each person fulfill their role. And as the lead creator, even if the rest of the staff sometimes loses sight of the whole picture, it’s your job to hold the course and make sure you keep to that initial vision.\nUnfortunately I’ve seen it happen many times where the developers get carried away with themselves, and they’re having a really good time, but it ends up harming the playability of the finished game.\nAny time Miyamoto-san talks about “games” I map this to “websites” in my head. I’m endlessly inspired. These three short paragraphs contain multitudes.\nFind something you want to make that matches up with something the market currently needs.\nPolish and raise your idea to a sufficient level of quality.\nYou need clear direction for your idea, even with a talented staff.\nThe goal is for each staff member to contribute.\nIt’s your job to hold the course and keep to the initial vision.\nDevelopers getting carried away ends up harming the end product\nAll of these.

Each year I've looked forward to meeting with developers, learning what they were working on, and hearing their needs.  As we weren't able to meet in-person for the last two years, our online CDS events were the best way for us to connect through AMAs, workshops, office hours and more.\nEach year, we plan our engagements based on the state of the ecosystem to ensure we are addressing developers' needs as best we can. This year, instead of hosting CDS and asking you to come to us, we're meeting you where you are in your region, at your favorite conferences and events, and on various online forums such as Twitter Spaces. Check out the list of events where you'll find the Chrome team and bookmark this page to get the latest updates.\nI'm so excited to get back into the community and we look forward to connecting with you at a virtual event, GDG DevFest, performance.now(), or another summit near you!",

          "description": "I haven't built mobile apps in years.  These days I carry an Android phone and am generally unhappy with how poorly these applications require a network connection to do anything. Many apps don't fail stable in the sense that if there is a server error they don't present the last known good view of data.  What this means in practice is if there is low network availability (on a train, at a concert or festival, a sporting event) many of these apps completely break.\nBack years ago I would design apps to sync to a local database (which was relatively easy to do on IOS). Apps would maintain consistent state on the device and leverage local storage.  I haven't looked under the hood but many apps appear to be using HTMLish front ends that are stateless, except for some cached login information.  As a user - what I see is that the app repeatedly tries to login and fetch all information every time you load it.  Which if you have perfect LTE/5G/WIFI is sort of ok, but in other situations sucks.  if the app can't talk to the network it really doesn't work at all.\nExample apps that generally fail stable: gmail, text messaging\nSort of fail stable: slack, although if you get a push message slack requires talking to the network to get the message even though it came through the push message.  In practice this means significant latency between seeing the message on the phone and then going to the conversation view (which can take forever to load under poor networking).  Back when I built apps we stuck the contents of the push message in the local DB so it was visible for users \nApps that don't fail stable: Hyundai blue link, Electrify America\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32970485\nPoints: 27\n# Comments: 14",

          "description": "I am a regular on a web forum where users quite often share screenshots from their iPhone, and in an attempt to redact identifying information in these screenshots, often do I find PII swabbed with the highlighting tool.\nEven with the Opacity set to 100% and the color to Black, it leaves the sensitive information underneath visible (yes I understand this is a highlighter, move on this note below).\nBefore you tell me the proper way to do it, which is to ...\n(once in Markup)\n1. Tap the Plus button on the far bottom right\n2. Select the Rectangle or Circle shape\n3. Tap the Shape Options button in the bottom left (the icon used doesn't even make it obvious as to what this button is for)\n4. Select Solid Fill for the shape\n5. Position solid shape over the sensitive information\n...\nMy argument is that while it is possible to properly redact sensitive information, it's much too easy for people to improperly redact because it is difficult to tell that a 100% opacity black highlighter does not work. On a phone screen, it can look completely opaque. Only once you see it on a better display do you realize just how visible the info is.\nAlso, while the pencil/pen tool (far left) does properly redact, its max size is much too small. People who use this one and just haphazardly try to scribble over all of the info, which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.\nSolutions:\n1. Create a tool specific for redacting\n2. Make it so that 100% opacity highlighting is opaque (or at least warn the user if they set the opacity to 100%). Yes, this is not what \"highlighting\" is, but make the default opacity value like 30-50% and have people change it as needed. If it looks opaque on a phone screen, IT SHOULD BE.\n3. Allow the user to set the max width of the pen/pencil tool much larger. Make it a sliding scale instead of 5 discrete sizes.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32941035\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

I have came up with various solutions but I would like to hear from someone who has some real experience with this very niche type of project, if possible.\nMostly the issue is real money vs virtual money in the system. Chargebacks, returns, currencies, multiple bank accounts, multiple payment processors, fees for bank or payment processors transfers that can make real money mismatch the virtual money and so on.\nIt's not a simple question I could ask and get a straight answer so I guess it will be more like a discussion.\nTanks.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32901169\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "A few weeks ago I bought a one month Disney+ subscription to check it out. I have all kinds of problems when using their web player compared to Netflix and YouTube:\n- subtitle settings get reset every time I close the website.\n- the button for changing subtitles is in the upper right corner. Once you open the menu the button for closing it appears in the upper left corner. You can't close the menu by clicking outside of it, despite the fact that you can still see the blurred video in the background.\n- pressing space doesn't pause the video, but repeats the last action you did. If you closed the subtitle menu by pressing esc, pressing space will open it again. If you entered the full screen mode, pressing space will close it.\n- there is no way (afaik) to open a list of all episodes from within the player. You have to go back to the show's main page, choose the season (because it always defaults to season 1) and scroll a horizontal list (which always defaults to the first episode) using a button that appears only once you hover it. Scrolling with a mouse scroll/touchpad doesn't work.\n- it is impossible to search for movies using a director's name. For example, I know that Disney+ has a lot of Charlie Kaufman's and Wes Anderson's movies available - they are my favorite directors - but I couldn't quickly check which specific movies there are.\nI know that it's possible that I have higher standards of UX because I'm a programmer, but I doubt that Disney+'s interface is intuitive to anyone.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32837397\nPoints: 43\n# Comments: 89",

          "description": "I recently purchased an old iPhone 11 Pro Max to try out, after being an Android user the last 12yrs, last phone being the Oneplus 7. I knew there would be big differences and I tried to be as accepting as possible along the way.\nIt's been a few weeks now and I would really like to hear from current or former iPhone users on their thoughts about iOS's maneuverability.\nMy thoughts:\nThe iOS UI thrives on having the user perform tedious steps to perform very simple actions [1], is difficult to use in one hand (I understand there are smaller models but I wanted a bigger battery, this should not excuse the lack of maneuverability), and THERE IS NO UNIVERSAL BACK BUTTON! When you need to go back, you have to figure out how the current app wants you to go backwards. Swipe from the left edge? anywhere on screen? or exit using the button at the top of the screen? It's a guessing game every time.\nI really want to like this phone, the hardware is incredible and the software support for years is terrific. Could long time users please chime in on how they got used to it?\n[1] Reaching to the top right corner to drag down the Control Panel. Having to press the 'Select' button in Photos instead of long pressing a photo. Having to tap a toggle icon exactly for it to change status.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32832474\nPoints: 13\n# Comments: 29",

          "description": "Disclaimer: Thought Experiment. Does not need to be \"practical\". Let your NIH flow and your imagination run wild\nWe've learned a lot about computers in the decades we've been producing. A lot of software assumes that computers work a certain way. See Go lang and how it handles file permissions. In the Linux Kernel drivers exist that supports the IBM 3270 Display System which at this point is over 50 years old. Terminal Emulators mimic the VT100. All of this makes sense given the context in which they were developed and created. But if you were developing an OS in 2022 without these constraints what would you remove and or change? Would you keep 32bit support? Arm, Risc and or x86?, monolithic or microkernel?, C, Rust, Zig, D, C++, or something else?, how would it talk to hardware?, what would your executable format look like?\nAlso if anyone has any interesting links to cutting edge research into Modern Operating Systems I'd love to browse them!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32813072\nPoints: 31\n# Comments: 26",

So I've taken what I learned from building that, and have spent all my spare time this year building Modern for HN.\nI realize this won't be for everyone, but it was a fun project to work on, and I'm really happy with the result so far. Hope you like it too!\nLots more planned for future updates, and suggestions welcome :)\n[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29461735\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32768590\nPoints: 222\n# Comments: 142",

          "description": "I have only had around 2 YoE as a backend developer, but I already have a deep interest in system design.\nThat said, I have realistic expectations in that becoming a software architect requires field experience with different systems, patterns, making mistakes and learning some lessons the hard way.\nNonetheless, I already started learning at least the theoretical foundations thanks to:\n* Designing Data-Intensive Applications\n* System Design Primer\n* Web Scalability for Startup Engineers\n* System Design Interview by Alex Xu\n* Quastor subscription\n* Infoq talks, etc.\nMy interest is only increasing, and I try to participate as much as possible in architecture-related discussions at work with the more experienced developers.\nThanks to the learning resources, it's no longer a problem to understand the theory, but due to lack of experience, I understandably feel anxious and unconfident thinking about designing something myself.\nLet me make it clear, I understand that with that little experience under the belt, you can't suddenly become a software architect after having read a book.\nHowever, some day everyone should start. It would be really cool to find out how currently experienced software architects started their path, designed their first systems, what they would recommend to optimize and fasten the learning process.\nThanks!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32753619\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nLong story short - I'm looking around to see if there are any job boards that would be focused on finding UX people.\nMy friend has a degree in architecture, she was working for quite a few years in variety of building design shops. At some point in her life she moved to suburbs and had children, took a few years off to care for them. Now kids are in school and she is looking to go back to work life, she is craving for interaction with people. She decided to pivot her career and do UX since it is something she is familiar with from her previous jobs, the reason for doing this is that where she lives it would take her roughly 2 hours driving to get to the city and her previous industry is not very remote-friendly.\nShe is trying to get hired as junior UX, however with no success. It had been a couple of months now and she is reaching the point of being depressed for being rejected from every place shy is applying to. I have no experience with UX to give her advice on making her first steps.\nI know it's probably not the best time for juniors but life likes to write scenarios with no regard to economic situation... so any advice would be highly appreciated :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32694898\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I've been building products for many years and, most of the time, my \"admin UI\" would be some SQL GUI (currently Adminer with a custom plugin).\nThat's what I'd use to resolve support cases, change some data for the customers when it's absent from the real UI, etc.\nUsually, there's just no time to build internal admin apps when you're a solo founder or a small team.\nHowever, I'm not really happy with this way of doing things. There's no \"global search\", no place to attach notes, and often it's hard to jump to related records (e.g. client -> client's transactions) quickly.\nAs I'd run the SQL GUI locally, it's always hard to share links to some records with my team, other than in the form of screenshots.\nThe list of problems goes on and on.\n-----\nHence it prompted this question. What do you use? How do you debug data issues? How do you help customers? How do you share links (whatever form they take) to data with your team and collaborate?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32687949\nPoints: 6\n# Comments: 9",

          "description": "I might be too 'junior' to grok what goes behind the curtains. When I did a quick survey amongst my software friends, all of their workplaces have been pushing for bringing people back in offices. Some are a bit soft and coy about it (\"From November, we will allow you to choose WFH for half the week!\"), And some are straightforward \"you have to\".\nIn my workplace, the management itself reported high remote productivity. Despite this, we will be asked to work remotely only half the time. They even have a big new building in city center location.\nIs it simply something cynical, e.g. Trying to hold on to prime real estate, or somplyyabout control? Or is there indeed legitimate net benefit to working in offices?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32741902\nPoints: 14\n# Comments: 22",

          "description": "I'm not a web developer, but I dabble in it because I find it interesting. I went through some courses like The Odin Project and others to learn the basics of HTML/CSS/JS, and I thought it made a lot of sense: HTML structures the page, CSS handles the style, and JS handles the functionality.\nHowever, after working for software companies for a few years, it seems like almost nobody uses these technologies in the way they're presented on websites like w3schools to make web applications. Instead, they use component-based frameworks like React. To me, these frameworks seem way more complicated than HTML/CSS/JS, and I don't understand what problem they're trying to solve. What makes the trade-off of all that extra complexity and abstraction worth it? Aren't HTML/CSS/JS perfectly fine and time-tested tools for web development on their own?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32780191\nPoints: 250\n# Comments: 316",

The HTTP server does server-side rendering, including serving up static CSS and SVG files.\nFor reasons, the web server framework doesn't support \ncaching out-of-the-box and we hand-roll our own.\nI thought we might as well complexify our deployment step instead and reap some performance benefits. Immediately, I thought to use Amazon S3 for the CSS files. Does any one else do this? Is there something lower latency than S3?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32730788\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",
