          "description": "One of my favorite ideas for Twitter was by Oliver Reichenstein in a post called “Make Bots Identifiable”. Oliver makes the case that apps should notify users if the author of the post is a feed, a bot, or an actual human and the UI of the application should reflect that accordingly. The example Oliver gives is setting bot text into monospace and giving it an obvious 🤖 icon.\n\nIt’s a simple premise: “make bots identifiable”. Think of how this would neuter Russian disinformation worldwide. It would expose the underbelly of buying bot followers, exposing fake influencers and hustlers as social and political frauds. This, of course, depends on social media companies running bot analysis on their users, which they’d never do because it would pollute the New Users Chart Goes Brrrr metrics that Wall Street loves.\nOn Mastodon, however, you can self-identify your account as a human or a bot. Not every feed/bot account does this and not every Mastodon client reflects this option in their UI, but one that does is Elk. Bots in the main feed get a small 🤖 icon, like in Oliver’s dream! I decided to use Arc’s Boosts feature to add some custom CSS to make the text monospace for an even more obvious effect.\n\n/* Elk.zone */\ndiv[flex]:has([i-mdi\\:robot-outline]) .status-body {\n  font-family: monospace;\n}\n\n\nThe result is obvious and clear.\n\nSimple selector, not the cleanest, but got to use :has(). It’d be nice if more Mastodon clients (or Twitter, or YouTube, or Twitch, or Bluesky, or whatever’s next) surfaced this kind of information in the main feed. Anyways…\nArc Boosts are cool 😎\nAdd human-readable classnames and allow humans to change your site if they want (or need) to\nMake the Web more human",

I get it, you want new users, but your existing users need to log in too!\n2) auto play of video previews.\nNetflix, YouTube, Etc… they all do it. I don’t want the movie to start because I clicked to read the full description, or worse on the main screen just because I stop navigating for a second to read the blurb. I don’t want videos in my suggested feed on YouTube to play silently and then start 20 or 30 seconds into the video once I do click them. Does ANYBODY find these useful?  Why are they the default behaviors? Who do they benefit? Don’t they just end up costing unnecessary bandwidth?  I know that I can usually turn them off, but having to search for the setting is frustrating.\n…and don’t even get me started on form validators that are overly strict when they could just strip the unwanted delimiters or white space themselves, or password fields that cannot be pasted, or password rules that make it impossible to generate a random password.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35749631\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 6",

          "description": "Hey! Alexis and Tobi here. We built a native macOS client for ChatGPT API that is free to use (macOS Ventura).\nhttps://www.jamgpt.app/\nWe built and fine-tuned it to scratch our own specific text-processing itches, so we just wanted to share this with the community.\nIf you work with a lot of text or code like we do, check it out.\nIts core features include:\n- Instantly talk to ChatGPT from anywhere on your Mac by pressing a keyboard shortcut.\n- Avoid typing out repetitive prompts by saving prompts and accessing them quickly.\n- Just download and start typing as you would with ChatGPT. No need to learn anything new.\n- Comes with both dark and light mode options\nBatteries included: For the first 100 prompts, you can use our API key to try it out right away. After that, you can add your own OpenAI API key. The app is completely free to use and will remain so.\nWe may add additional pro features in the future, but we have no commercial intentions at the moment. Whatever you see now will remain free.\nThis is our first version, so things aren't perfect yet, and some features might be missing.\nGive it a spin and let’s talk! We’d love to hear your feedback.\nCheers! Tobi & Alexis\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35714731\nPoints: 7\n# Comments: 8",

I'm probably not the first to agree on this, and there are probably people who disagree.\nThis is how I would build a social media app as an example. But it works for a wide variety applications, from social to money to inventory tracking, and it's served me well each time.\n1. Make each table a logical collection of events that have occurred, not objects or state. This is not CRUD. One row means one event, for example a table `react` means \"a user reacted to some post.\" Keep these events as close as possible to the end user's intent.\n2. Never delete or update rows as a way to record events. This would mean forgetting that something happened. Only do that for manual corrections or spec…",

          "description": "Please hear me out: Do not consider this as some unrealistic ambitious project that I am going to pursue. This is purely a thought experiment and design discussion on the feasibility of the idea that bothers me.\nI use Emacs most of the time. I do consider it a great piece of software purely due to its extensible nature. I can go on about how Emacs is fabulous, but that is not the point here.\nI use VSCODE too. And it is also a great text editor based on Electron.\nElectron is a great framework too.\nMost of us while doing software development, use a browser. Either for browsing documentation, finding answers, checking the meaning of the error messages, etc. We copy code from the editor, shell to the browser, and back to the editor, and shell.\nAlso using electron we can create almost any kind of desktop application. Currently what is happening is we create/ship the entire Chrome/JS run time to create an entirely new application for each specific case.\nNow let's try to put the pieces together.\nWhy can't there be a single editor that has a similar extensible nature as emacs but uses JavaScript as the scripting language, and develop extension using HTML and CSS unlike only a text-based extension using elisp in emacs, so that we can leverage the Chrome runtime efficiently?\nWhy can't we browse the web, edit text, and use the terminal all simultaneously?\nYes, anything is possible given that we solve the hurdles.\nBased on your expertise and experience what challenges do you consider one may face during the design and implementation of these requirements?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35683141\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 8",

I looked for a couple minutes and couldn’t find anything so it’s possible I missed it - but nothing is obvious.\nAdditionally, the expected place one would look for such a “feature” is the top right of the page - and that’s where the mobile site puts the link to messages. So it seems to be kind of an intentional loop into getting Users to view messages rather than leaving.\nAm somewhat dumbfounded by this but certainly seems like a dark pattern. Phuck you linkedin for this kind of stuff. I’ve always hated this platform and know others share similar feelings (and know there are advocates for it - fair enough).\nMy browser is set to not store cookies/cache anyway so after closing the mobile browser I was logged out.

It looks similar to ChatGPT, but has a few more features.\nIt does require you to have an API key for the GPT API. The API key is stored in your browser local storage , but a hash of it is used to make sure your history is unique to you. The hash is stored in the backend.\nThere are two main reasons why I created this for myself, you also might find it useful:\n- I would really wanted ChatGPT to have access get contents from websites\n- I don't like subscription fees and I don't like how slow the free ChatGPT is, I like to pay-as-I-go, and GPT API already allows me to do that\nP.S. There's also a Chrome extension for summarising pages, but it's my first time creating a Chrome extension. It's ugly and buggy, and the slow review process of the Chrome web app developer  console doesn't help.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35664563\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I'm obsessed with OpenAI and ChatGPT and I want to work on a voice powered version so that I can just chat with it directly.\nI find the streaming text based response distracting and honestly I'd just like to talk to it as if it were a partner/collaborator.\nMy thinking is to use OpenAI Whisper as the Speech to Text (STT) input:\nhttps://openai.com/research/whisper\nThen stream the results to a Text To Speech (TTS).\nI'm going to use the raw OpenAI chat API to access GPT directly.\nI'm going to OSS it and put it up on Github.\nThe problem I'm having now is that I need a way to stream the output of ChatGPT to the the TTS system.\nI think I need something BETTER than the Google Cloud Speech API so I'm looking for a recommendation.\nMy idea is to buffer the output from GPT until I have 1-2 sentences, THEN start streaming that, on sentence boundaries, to the TTS system.\nThat should enable both low latency responses but also give the TTS system a decent chance of making the results sound like an actual human without any jarring breaks (at least I hope)\nThe problem is that the Google Cloud Speech API doesn't have a streaming API.\nThough I guess if I only send 2-3 sentences at a time that I can aggregate these in the client and keep the latency small.\nThoughts?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35429834\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

This reminded me of how I had no idea how impactful this word could be for users. I’ll add the word “don’t worry” here as well when referring to their issues.\nI came to understand that they can come across as dismissive or condescending. Or, even worse, can make the person feel as though their problem is insignificant or that they are not intelligent enough to understand the solution.\nTo change this behaviour, I had a userscript that highlighted these words whenever I typed them, making me more aware of them and looking for ways to rewrite the sentence.\nCan you think of a work habit you had that you wanted to change, and what steps you took to change it?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35764181\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hello Hacker News community,\nI wanted to share with you a tool I created called MonitUp that has helped me improve my productivity by tracking my computer activities and providing weekly recommendations based on the data.\nMonitUp tracks which apps and websites I use during the day, and based on that data, it offers recommendations on how I can better manage my time and be more productive. For example, it has suggested that I create a schedule for myself that includes time for work, rest, and leisure activities, and to prioritize my tasks so that I'm focusing on the most important ones first.\nI created MonitUp because I was struggling with productivity and wanted a way to track my time and get recommendations on how to improve. It has been incredibly helpful for me, and I wanted to share it with the Hacker News community.\nI'm not here to advertise my product, but rather to share my experience and offer a recommendation for anyone who is looking for a tool to help them improve their productivity. If you're interested in trying MonitUp out, feel free to visit our website at https://timetracking.monitup.com/ and sign up for a free trial.\nI'm also here to ask for feedback from the community. What do you think about MonitUp? What other features would you like to see? How can I improve the tool to better serve our users?\nThank you for taking the time to read this, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.\nBest,\nFaruk Durak\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35679935\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

I’m talking about hanging off a glacier in the sun, writing code.\nAnd by poor vision, I mean, corrected, I can just about read a newspaper in poor lighting. I can’t see your laptop over your shoulder. You’ll need to jack up the font size, thanks. I’ve never understood shiny screens, it’s like a mirror to me.\nI’m not worried about power supply, yet. The current state of batteries should be fine.\nAlso connectivity is not a problem, yet. I’ll tether my phone, or use some satellite service.\nI appreciate that this is idealistic but bear with me. My dream life scenario is that I’m on some physical adventure/expedition, and suddenly we need some code to save our lives. (Anyone do this?)\nSo I need terminals, IDE’s, connectivity, text and voice based communication, GPT. All the good stuff. I don’t need high resolution or photo/video editing, yet.\nLess ambitiously and more realistically, I’d like to work in my back garden when the sun is out.\nI’ve always been on the fence about keyboards. I don’t like the rigid posture required but I have adapted to become an efficient user of this tool. And fixing the keyboard to the tiny screen (classic laptop) makes it worse. I’ve always thought we can do better.\nAm I just looking for a rugged E-ink tablet?\nI should also add, I’m super optimistic and re-energised about where the tech is headed with E-ink for displays and GPT for productivity. The opportunities feel liberating.\nThanks\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35599057\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hi everyone!\nAron (@arondeparon) here, founder of Gistreader.com.\nI was an avid user of Google Reader back in the day, but for some reason, I silently rolled over when they decided to kill it and never looked at RSS again.\nLately, I am getting more and more frustrated by the fact that most of the content that I consume is being pushed at me by some kind of algorithm. I wanted more control over this process, so decided to build GistReader.\nIn its basic form, GistReader is an RSS reader that aims to make your reading experience as fast and pleasant as possible. In addition to that, it uses AI to automatically create summaries of your articles and uses text-to-speech to optionally read a condensed version of an article to you out loud.\nGistReader is my first-ever product launch, so as you might expect, I'm pretty nervous about that, especially when it comes to sharing it on HN :)\nPlease, feel free to let me know what you think. It's all very early-days (lots of things I want to fix/improve/build) and the only way I can improve is by getting solid feedback from people that might actually use it.\nThanks!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35516274\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hi, I've been playing around with doc2.site which uses Google Docs to create web pages. I tried several Chat GPT plugins to enhance my doc content with semantics like headings, emphasised text etc.\nThe problem is I always get plain text responses from Chat GPT (and plugins) even if you ask for the HTML output and then if you copy paste the output into Google Docs, you get the HTML tags like \nblah\n.I found a script that does copy the output as HTML:\n\"const blob = new Blob([html], {type: 'text/html'});\" so it's super easy actually but I couldn't find a plugin that handles it nicely like a copy paste response as HTML button.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35449723\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",
