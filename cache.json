          "description": "In 2009 I was working on the Argos checkout flow.\nWe were considering focusing the first input when the page loads. The idea was to save users a click (never a good sign). Back then we had to use JS, but now we have the HTML5 autofocus attribute.\nEither way, automatically focusing the first input causes 5 specific problems that degrade UX.\nHere they are:\nProblem #1: it makes the page jump unexpectedly\nWhen any normal web page loads, focus remains at the top.\nWith autofocus, focus jumps suddenly to the first input.\nBut this is disorientating and may cause users to think something has gone wrong.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAutomatically focusing the input makes the page jump\n\t\n\nProblem #2: it stops users scrolling with the keyboard\nUsers often scroll a web page after page load by pressing ↑ and ↓.\nWith autofocus, the keys are ignored because the input is focused.\nThis makes the interface feel broken.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe up and down keys get ignored as focus is inside the input\n\t\n\nProblem #3: it stops users going back with the keyboard\nSome users navigate back by keyboard using #+← for example.\nWith autofocus, the shortcut is ignored because the input is focused.\nThis slows users down.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe keyboard shortcut to go back is ignored as focus is inside the input\n\t\n\nProblem #4: it’s unexpected for screen reader users\nWhen a web page loads, a screen reader announces the page title.\nWith autofocus, the input’s label is announced instead.\nThis is disorientating and causes users to lose context.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe screen reader announces the input instead of the page\n\t\n\nProblem #5: it works badly on mobile\nOn mobile, focusing an input usually opens the keyboard.\nWith autofocus this doesn’t happen. On Android, for example, the input is focused but the user has to tap again to open the keyboard.\nThis makes the interface feel broken.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tOn Android, the input is focused but the user needs to tap \n\t\n\nJust let users focus the first input\nGood design puts users in control.",

          "description": "In 2016 I worked at the Department for Work and Pensions.\nI was working on a complex form field made up of nested fieldsets. It was inaccessible which surprised me because I was only using fieldsets, legends, labels and radio buttons. Nothing fancy.\nBut as I did more research, it became clearer that nested fieldsets can be problematic.\nHere’s why:\nProblem #1: screen readers only announce the inner legend\nLet’s say you have appointment times organised by day and period.\nA fieldset for each day and for morning and afternoon\n\t\n\nIf the user moves from 3:15pm on Tuesday to 9:55am on Wednesday, screen readers will announce ‘9:55am, morning’. They will not announce ‘Wednesday 23 October’.\nThis is confusing and may cause users to select the wrong date. Or it may cause them to traverse the page line by line because they don’t trust the interface.\nProblem #2: screen readers won’t announce the end of a fieldset\nLet’s say you have a question that says ‘Do you like chocolate?’ And selecting ‘Yes’ reveals a nested question that says ‘Do you prefer light or dark chocolate?’\nRadio buttons that reveal another question\n\t\n\nIf the user moves from ‘Dark chocolate’ to ‘No’, screen readers will not announce that they left the inner fieldset.\nThis is confusing because ‘No’ does not make sense as an answer for ‘Do you prefer light or dark chocolate?’\nAvoid nested fieldsets where possible\nFor appointment times the fieldset for morning and afternoon could be removed because each label already says ‘am’ or ‘pm’.\nFor the conditional reveal the nested question could be shown on the next page. This may sound long winded but it usually reduces cognitive load and speeds users up.\n(Note: Some nested fieldsets may be okay. For example, I often use them to reveal a date field with day, month and year inputs after selecting ‘Yes’ to knowing that date. This hasn’t raised issues in accessibility audits.)",

          "description": "Today we're proud to announce the release of Carbon Control, an exciting new feature in Catchpoint WebPageTest.\nCentral to this new feature is the inclusion of a new  experimental metric in WebPageTest for measuring a website's Carbon Footprint. Measuring carbon footprint has been the most requested and discussed issue in our tracker, and for good reasons: the web community is increasingly concerned about reducing our contributions to climate change, and companies will increasingly be held accountable for monitoring and reducing their emissions. At Catchpoint WebPageTest, we find this challenge worthy and interesting and we're proud to contribute tools to the effort.\nBut Carbon Control goes farther than merely measuring your footprint... it allows you to take action! That's where the \"cont…",

          "description": "WebPageTest is a great tool for measuring your website’s performance, providing detailed metrics and actionable advice. They’ve just released a brand new add-on, Carbon Capture, which measures the CO2 emissions generated by a website. It includes detailed breakdowns on which resources have the greatest carbon impact, as well as quantifying the total emissions. Read all about it in this blog post by Scott Jehl at WebPageTest.\nThis is awesome in terms of providing more visibility to developers on the environmental impact of the products we build. I hope it will help provide greater incentives for debt and their clients to prioritise performance and sustainability. Perhaps in the not too distant future we’ll see these metrics as a standard part of developer tools, making carbon awareness fully mainstream.\nWe should also remember these are estimated emissions, using our best available resources for measuring our websites carbon emissions right now, as Fershad writes in his excellent article Is data transfer the best proxy for website carbon emissions?. But hopefully it won’t be too long before we see these tools proving a more accurate picture.\nVideo: Building a Greener Web\nI gave a talk at All Day Hey conference recently about why this stuff matters, and some practical steps we as developers can take to reduce the environmental impact of the products we build. Watch it here to learn more.",

          "description": "The Soviet Union had an engineering problem. Thousands of miles of remote frozen arctic coastline that needed lighthouses and radio towers which required power. But those places were too cold and too remote for human operators in the winter months, so the Soviets devised a plan to deploy small Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs). Radioactive strontium-90 heats an arrangement of metal fins, the fins cool, and a semiconductor turns that energy into electricity. The RTG’s design was the same tech the Soviet Union used to deploy radio to areas without power. What could go wrong?\nIt’s worth noting this was the advent of the nuclear era; the pre-Chernobyl era. There had been no nuclear disaster that might have made them question this strategy, the superpowers had mastered the atom afte…",

          "description": "I love Behind The Scenes style documentaries of animated films. It’s a niche genre but very fulfilling for me – a dad who watches almost exclusively animated TV and films with my children. Above is a playlist of ~20 short behind-the-scenes documentaries of some of the greatest animated films from some of the greatest animation studios. I rewatch all these from time to time and reference them frequently, so I thought I’d collect them in a playlist and share.\nThe obsession started before kids actually, as part of trying to learning how large creative projects are successful. I get a lot of inspiration from seeing how animated films come together. Animated films that take years to make are incredibly different from the work I do but share some principles that I feel apply to large software projects like websites.\nThere’s tons of gleanable insights from their processes and tools. Processes like “dailies” or a “brain trust” like they talked about in the book Creativity, Inc. seem apt for web development. I often wonder if a Producer/Director-model would be better for websites.\nI have some non-YouTube recommendations as well. I’ve posted some them before, but here’s a running list of documentaries and docu-series I’ve come across:\nBeyond Infinity (2022, Disney+)\nInto the Unknown: Making Frozen 2 (2020, Disney+)\nInside Pixar (2020, Disney+)\nI Know That Voice (2013, Prime Video)\nThe Kingdom of Dreams and Madness (2013, HBO Max)\nWaking Sleeping Beauty (2009, Disney+)\nThe Pixar Story (2007, Disney+)\nFrank and Ollie (1995, Disney+)\nAlways up for more YouTube and feature length documentaries, if you have any you liked send them my way.",

They can lead to a feeling of visually generic sameness instead of a feeling of cohesion across an experience.\nWe’re all subtly influenced by the zeitgeist of the day but —in my experience— a lot of the look and feel of components in a design system get born out of a fear of variable content. On my first big design system project I remember someone telling me, “This component has to be able to exist in any context” and I felt the weight of the universe pressing on my shoulders.

          "description": "The shorthand for embedding an image in Markdown is the following:\n\n![descriptive text goes here](example.jpg)\n\n\nThis works for rendering an image in the same way a skateboard is a minimum viable replacement for car; it rolls, but not fast. To render an image responsibly in modern times you need a handful more properties than src and alt ; namely height, width, loading, and decoding attributes.\n\n<img src=\"example.jpg\" \n     alt=\"descriptive text goes here\" \n     height=\"400\" \n     width=\"300\" \n     decoding=\"async\"\n     loading=\"lazy\">\n\n\nHere’s a quick summary of what those other attributes do and why you should have them:\nheight + width - The HTML spec changed slightly and now setting a height and width draws an aspect-ratio’d box for the image to paints in. This prevents layout shift as the image loads.\ndecoding=\"async\" (Optional) - This prevents the browser from blocking other content and move image decoding  it decodes the image data to a bitmap. I feel like this should be the browser default?\nloading=\"lazy\" (Optional) - Recommended for any image below the fold.\nHonorable mentions\nsrcset + sizes - If you want the fastest images, you can offer different sizes and cuts of your images. I don’t do this and Lighthouse is always mad about it.\nfetchpriority - This is like driving a manual stick shift, but may be useful. I think loading=\"lazy|eager\" are easier to reason about than fetchpriority but I’m not your boss.\nSome Markdown formatters have a custom syntax that supports adding more attributes, like Kramdown…\n\n![descriptive text goes here](example.jpg){: height=\"36px\" width=\"36px\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" }\n\n\nThis makes your Markdown less readable and less portable to other engines. If you’re going to include all these attributes, you might as well use an HTML <img> tag. This will make your images consistent with the other (unsupported without plugins) media like <video>, <audio>, <picture>, and <svg> in your Markdown posts.",

One is sweet, nimble; it serenades. The other grinds like endlessly like a cat in a vice; a groaning wooden automaton.\nAs much as I dislike the hurdy-gurdy as a concept, history shows that the hurdy-gurdy democratized music and lowered the bar for people to create (loud) music. The hurdy-gurdy was widely used in churches before organs got popular. It stands to reason this mechanized monstrosity with push button keys was easier to popularize than it’s more technical stringed cousins.\nAs history progressed, the fiddle came back into the mainstream and orchestras ruled the mainstream for centuries… until the guitar.\nThere’s a metaphor in here about software engineering somewhere, I’m sure of it.",

This article explores how WebGPU is an improvement over the current solution of WebGL, with a sneak peek at future developments.

By allowing web applications to take advantage of GPUs, WebGL enables amazing experiences on the web—from Google Earth, to interactive music videos, to 3D real-estate walkthroughs and more. WebGL was based on the OpenGL family of APIs first developed in 1992. That's a long time ago!

Wanted to get Hacker New's take on whether this design is possible.\nStructure and Composition: The orb's structure is a sphere composed of strong, lightweight materials akin to those used in modern aircraft or spacecraft. These materials are capable of withstanding the pressures and forces experienced during flight while also minimizing the orb's overall weight.\nBuoyancy: The orb is filled with a lighter-than-air gas su…",

          "description": "I recently needed to check a past transfer to confirm that I was sending some crypto to the same wallet address. In the past, the last few transactions showed up on the \"Pay\" page. They have since renamed \"Pay\" to Transfers or something like that. They no longer show past transactions, so I went down a rabbit hole of searching through the app, couldn't find it, then had to google it and found a help page for Coinbase. There is a link in the article to coinbase.com/reports (I can find no way to get to it from the web app except by following the link from the help article.) Once there, you can select the date ranges you want and generate a transaction report in PDF or CSV and then you have to wait a bit while it generates the report for you to download.\nWhat kind of UI craziness is this? A user's transaction history is such a basic feature, I can't imagine contributing the obfuscation of this history to just incompetence. There must be some dark pattern here. Perhaps the want to hide from user's how much real money they are putting into the system? It seems like a serious security risk anyway. Someone with unauthorized access to an account could easily siphon off crypto and it would be difficult to notice unless you are frequently generating and downloading transaction reports and going through them.\nI am not finding much talk of this. Am I in the minority thinking that this is a mission critical, absolutely bare bones feature that should be front and center of any finance related app?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36179175\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nI am assuming that most Software Engineers don’t get hands on System Design work in their day-to-day job, my questions are:\n1. How to prep for System Design Interviews, given that most resources out there are very superficial in their explanation of what technology to use, when to use it and why to use it?\n2. Will becoming good at prepping for System Design interviews actually help in designing large scale systems better?\n3. If not 2, then how do you become better at designing actual systems?\nI already know that DDIA is a good resource but it does not help you design concrete systems.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36115528\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "I'm seeing it's a common theme, especially in the Python community, to implement tightly coupled UIs and business logic. It's done in the name of convenience, but inevitably backfires once you go past trivial applications.\nI've lived the whole evolution of web-based applications, back when CSS didn't exist and PHP was something added to HTML to make it \"dynamic\". I'm glad web development has evolved; I think everyone is. But why do we have to go back to it, repackage it as something cool and make the same mistakes?\nI understand it's appealing to those whose title isn't \"software engineer\", because MVC can be a pain. Should it be though?\nI'm working in this space, building a state-driven half no-code/half Python framework , but rather than driving more attention to it I'd like to discuss the premise.\nIs this a battle worth fighting? Or am I making a big deal out of something no one cares about?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35977460\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

You install the platform's agent to your infrastructure, add the registry you wanna deploy images from, and deploy them.\nWe made the platform to allow people who don't know anything about containers to set them up in dozens or hundreds of deployment targets. We thought it would be an interesting use case to engineers, too, who are uninterested or don't have the time to manage deployments and container maintenance in terminals.\nHope you find the platform useful and let us know if you have any feedback!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35960944\nPoints: 13\n# Comments: 1",

I am a chronic procrastinator and have tried everything to be more productive like lists, calendars, apps, etc. but I still can't seem to get things done. I want to study more, read more, and finish my coding projects. However, I end up not doing much and feel terribly guilty. I suspect I may have ADHD or some kind of dopamine addiction but I'm not sure. I do well in school even by studying at the last minute, and I attend a rather challenging school. In my free time though, I end up doing very little or nothing, not knowing where my time went. I try to remove all distractions but it doesn't seem to work.\nDoes anyone have any advice or strategies on how I can improve my productivity and focus? How have you overcome similar challenges to achieve your goals and stay focused? I feel stuck in this cycle of procrastination and distraction and want to break free.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36184605\nPoints: 49\n# Comments: 62",

          "description": "I've been thinking a lot recently about how technology, particularly AI, can play a role in personal productivity. One concept that's caught my attention is the idea of an 'AI conversation companion' for tracking thoughts, ideas, and progress in various areas of life. Imagine having an AI that you can converse with on a regular basis, where it asks you thoughtful questions about topics you're interested in or working on. Over time, it adapts its questions based on your responses and generates summaries, which can be reviewed and reflected upon at any time.\nSuch an AI companion could act as a kind of automated journal or diary, providing a space for reflection and self-improvement, but with the added benefits of interactivity and adaptability. It could also serve as an accountability tool, reminding you of your goals and progress, and prompting regular reflection.\nWhat do you all think about the potential of using AI to aid productivity? Have you used any similar tools or services? What methods do you use today to prep helping future AI companions understand your life/goals?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36129315\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

The main differentiator is that Yakread uses machine learning to rank the articles in your feed: as you click on articles from a particular RSS/newsletter subscription, other articles from that subscription will tend to be ranked higher in the future (via a bandit algorithm). Yakread also uses ML to recommend articles that other users have read, so your feed will have articles in it even before you sign up and add your own subscriptions.\nFor the recommendations, I'm using the collaborative filtering implementation from Spark MLlib[1]. I model RSS feeds instead of individual articles: when you click an article, that counts as a \"point\" for that article's RSS feed; at recommendation time, the algorithm first selects an RSS fe…",

          "description": "Do you ever feel like you're not making progress towards your life goals? Maybe you've set a goal to exercise more, read more books, or learn a new skill, but you struggle to stay motivated and on track. If this sounds familiar, habit tracking can be a powerful tool to help you achieve your goals.\nNotion is a versatile all-in-one workspace that can be customized to fit your specific needs. It's a great platform for tracking your habits and progress towards your life goals.\nHere's an example of a Notion system for tracking life goals and habits that allows you to track your life goals and habits on a daily basis, and provides a weekly summary to help you identify trends and areas for improvement. You can customize the template to fit your specific goals and habits, adding or removing items as necessary.\nHabit tracking in Notion has been a game-changer for me. It's helped me stay accountable, build momentum, and ultimately achieve my goals. By tracking my habits, I've been able to identify areas for improvement and adjust my strategies accordingly.\nIn addition to habit tracking, Notion also offers other features that can help you achieve your life goals. You can create a vision board to visualize your goals, track your progress towards them, and even break them down into smaller, more manageable tasks.\nIf you're looking for a way to achieve your life goals and build better habits, I highly recommend trying habit tracking in Notion. It's a powerful tool that can help you stay motivated and on track.\nLet me know if you have any questions or if you've found other helpful ways to track your life goals and habits!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35880510\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

I created this lib in the need of a simple and tiny framework to easily do AJAX-style navigation / replacement of fragments in the page, in a web application.\nFor people who don't want to use client-side-rendering and complex frameworks à la React, there are nowadays a few \"HTML-over-the-wire\" libraries, like HTMX, Unpoly or this super-tiny one Swap.js :)\nOne other key thing is that no external tool is needed: no bundler, no webpack, no TypeScript compiler, no minification needed. Just write HTML, JS (+ your preferred server-side language: PHP, Python, etc.) and it works.\nThe framework makes use of fetch (of course) but also MutationObserver API to be able to launch actions when parts of the DOM change.\nLet me know what you think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35991783\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

You start with plain old html and use alpinejs to enhance it to bring no-page-reload interactivity to web apps.\nThe Fir toolkit is designed for Go developers with moderate html/css & js skills who want to progressively build reactive web apps without mastering complex web frameworks. It includes a Go library and an Alpine.js plugin.\nHow it works ?\nOn receiving user-interactions the fir server re-renders html templates and sends it over the wire where the fir client library selectively updates the changed areas.\nWhen a user event is received by a Fir route, an array of html templates are rendered on the server and returned as an array of DOM events to the browser. The DOM events are consumed by the alpinejs plugin and dispatched within the DOM where listeners attached to elements can use the event to update the DOM.\nSee the demo and quickstart here: https://livefir.fly.dev/\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35881963\nPoints: 125\n# Comments: 39",

From my experience with Pokémon Mini handhelds, I was wondering if perhaps the power button wasn't getting the signal.\nSo I applied a slice of kitchen tin foil, some sticky tape and voilà, it powers up! I had to also apply it to the sound and start button (and I'll probably make this permanent with conductive paint one day), but otherwise it's all good.\n(And I snagged a flash cart so I was able to experience some translated romhacks too)",

The problem was that there was a repair attempt that had taken off the entire pad for the battery, and in fact had go through the pad, through the silk screen and had gone all the way into the fibre glass insulation layer (you might be able to see in the photo the woven pattern).\nBefore slapping a battery on and jumping the positive leg to the right component, I wanted to check that nothing else was missing. Thankfully the community have tried to preserve a lot of the history (in this case, the PCB traces) but also published it freely on the web.\nFrom this I also found a resistor had been lost in the previous repair. I don't think it's clear from my photo, but what I did was to bond the missing resistor in a completely different location (before it traces to a capacitor) and then use a jumper wire from the replaceable battery case. This was mostly in case the battery case was torn off again it wouldn't cause damage to the components on the board.\nOnce that was all done, the game happily had its clock and was returned to it's owner the same day.",
