I think it was Ahmad Shadeed who mentioned this on Twitter the other day, but I could be wrong.\nSo if you want to use clamp() for some fluid typography, say, with a calc() function for the middle value, instead of doing this:\nh1 {\n  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, calc(1rem + 3vw), 4rem);\n}\nYou can do this:\nh1 {\n  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 1rem + 3vw, 4rem);\n}\nIt totally makes sense, because min(), max() and clamp() already are math functions. But nonetheless, it’s something I wasn’t aware of before!\nIt works with custom properties too — check out this demo.\nIncidentally, if you want to know more about fluid typography in CSS (including accessibility concerns), this comprehensive guide by Adrian Bece has you covered.",

It’s great to see browsers working to support new CSS features quicker than ever before, and that pace should persist with Interop, an initiative where browser vendors work together to implement features interoperably. And with so-called “evergreen” browsers, most users should see those new features right away, as their browsers update seamlessly.\nBut, as Jim Neilsen pointed out, that doesn’t mean every user has the latest and greatest browser version.

This post is for RSS subscribers only.\nRead more about RSS Club.\n\nTwo years ago, Easter of 2020, I was chatting with some friends about crypto and one friend was starting to set aside some money and invest. Seemed harmless to do with “fun money”. We were in a pandemic after all, so no one was doing anything anyways. This was the height of the Gamestop and $DOGE meme stock market drama. I dismissed crypto at the time, but I used my Stocks app to follow the prices of $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, $DOGE, $SHIB, $LUNA, $XRP, $XTZ, and a some others that crossed my periphery field of view.\nYou see, it’s not hard to sell me on crypto. “Big banks, payday loans, and fees are problematic” = yes. “We can decentralize identity and web logins” = yes, cool. “We can decentralize payment” …",

At first glance, a single-axis spectrum might make perfect sense, a reduction of the problem, a right and a left, a binary dichotomy but with a grey area in the middle. But as I grow older a spectrum falls short for me in a couple different dimensions.\nTake color for instance. As kids we learned about the ROYGBIV visible spectrum of light, the zone between infrared light and ultraviolet light that most of us humans can see.\n\nThe rainbow, a naturally occurring ubiquitous concept. Children love rainbows. A light spectrum makes for a great science experiment or album cover. All the hues of visible light rolled into one gradient stripe.\nIn design tools the different hues are often represented in a 360º color wheel…",

          "description": "I got some landscaping done this month and as a reward the YouTube algorithm brought me a new genre of video called “Tall Grass”. These are the lawns with shoulder high grass, filled with mice and snakes, endlessly consuming buildings, fences, and concrete. It’s complete and utter ASMR for me.\n\nMy favorite among them is Al Bladez. Al and his best friend AJ take one day a week and offer to mow someone-in-need’s yard for free. To be clear, there’s an economy here, the homeowner gets their yard mowed and Al gets a YouTube video out of the deal which garners a million views. But the homeowners — and more often than not, the neighbors — are incredibly thankful to see the transformations.\nThe circumstances differ from yard to yard. Sometimes the homeowner is elderly, ailing, deceased, or in the hospital; unable or unfit to mow their lawn. In those situations Al’s work is a simple act of charity.\nSometimes, the homeowner is perfectly able but hasn’t mowed their lawn. What I love about Al is that he doesn’t show an ounce of judgement. Al doesn’t care if you’ve been in jail, or if you’re too poor, your mower broke, you’re unemployed, you’re struggling with addiction, or you’re just plain lazy. He’s there to cut grass — tall grass — and bring a bit of pride back to his community and hopefully help people dodge citations from the city.\nTo top it off, Al’s personal slogan is “Impact Over Views” and whew, that’s a lot to think about. I love that outlook and wish I could embody it more.\nWhatever religion Al is peddling, I want to be a part of it.",

This weekend I started on my planned redesign, but as I started nudging my About section, I found myself in a fight with my typography. After some hemming and hawing, I made the drastic decision to nuke my stylesheets and start over.\n~81 file changes later, I made another decision to yeet my changes live and do an open redesign. Not my original plan, but it’ll be good blog fodder. One thing I want to avoid is killing blogging momentum by getting sunk in a redesign branch.\nWithout further ado, as with any redesign, let’s see what we’re dealing with first…\nWebsite feature inventory\nHere’s a list of all the features on my little website that I maintain:\n330+ blog posts\nArt-directed posts with custom CSS, JavaScript, and SV…",

          "description": "Trying submitting again. Previously shown here[0], Tamagui is now in beta.\nTamagui is the first UI kit for React that has an optimizing compiler - one that not only extracts styles at build-time, but even evaluates inline styles and inline logic like ternaries / conditional spreads. It also flattens components (even those logic-containing ones) completely down to a div or View on Native when possible.\nAll of this leads to amazing performance gains[1], especially on the web and low-end mobile devices.\nI think Tamagui is also really special outside of just the performance. It has an incredibly powerful theme system which you can truly change every aspect of every component through, it supports a `size` prop on every component that just works, and it has incredible first-class animation support.\nRead more on the recent Beta blog post:\nhttps://tamagui.dev/blog/tamagui-enters-beta-themes-and-anim...\n---\n[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29321748\n[1] https://tamagui.dev/docs/intro/benchmarks\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31470885\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I’ve been making art and putting it on the internet for 20 years or so. I’ve used:\n- forums\n- Blogger/Wordpress\n- personal portfolio sites\n- YouTube for tutorial videos\n- FB/Twitter/Instagram/Tumblr\n- Gumroad for digital products\nNone of these outlets feels like a good “home” to me. Forums were great for WIP feedback but the good ones all died and got hacked. Blogs and my personal sites have always been good, but discoverability isn’t there. Social media platforms gave me a little more visibility, but lock-in and platform culture are extremely toxic. Instagram, for example, is touted as THE social media platform for artists, but the way they process image uploads is awful. The promotion or burying of posts is opaque.\nI want to create my work and put it where people might have a chance of seeing it, without algorithmic shenanigans or dark patterns.\nWhy is this so difficult? How would you approach solving this?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31403791\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 3",

I've adopted the idea of \"use different shades gray to make UIs\" and, as a result, my sites look... professional but uninviting.\nConsider sites like:\n- https://curius.app/\n- https://www.notion.so/\n- https://www.focusmate.com/\nThese sites look warm and inviting. Being proficient with Tailwind CSS just helps me have good padding, margins, and a reasonable default color scheme. It doesn't help me make my site look... human.\nI feel like I need a \"design palette\" instead of a mere \"color/margin palette\". What's the recommendation for this?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31317653\nPoints: 7\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "I had this question a while ago, trying to understand what is it about that swiping user experience on dating sites that makes them so appealing?\nObviously, the content matters too but I couldn’t get over the fact that just swiping is fun and maybe there is something in there.\nTo test my hypothesis, I started working on this project couple of weeks ago to see if swiping can increase \"survey\" engagement. The results were actually great in the sample size that I tested.\nLove to hear your thoughts and feedback: https://tuun.app/\nBest,\n Soheil\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31441859\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 1",
