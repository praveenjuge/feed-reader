Walks, boats, ebooks, I even bought a new iPad Mini to support my YouTube and RSS habits. Today my daughter turns six and I’m particularly sensitive to the passage of time. Lots of sunshine, lots of roses, but this month did bring with it some bad news.\nSome highlights…\n\nThe big news is that Shop Talk started a YouTube series. It’s thrice weekly’ish, 10~20 minute videos over on the CSS Tricks YouTube channel. I wrote a bit about it, but Chris and I are having a good time making videos. We’re up to 12 videos so far.

          "description": "🎉 After nearly ten years of weekly podcasts, Shop Talk has entered into a new realm: Video. Under the umbrella of the CSS-Tricks YouTube channel we’ve started posting daily-ish videos about front-end web development. This is a 🔥 year for CSS, so there’s no shortage of topics or #hotdrama to talk about and demo.\nWe’re still dialing in the formula, but it’s shaping up to look like 15~20 minute videos delivered thrice weekly. Math-wise, that’s not too different than doing another one hour podcast every week. Video of course is a little more involved, you need to spend a bit more effort planning out tech demos. Keeping our same (overly?) casual feel makes it all sustainable for us. If Chris and I were doing video content full time it might make sense to write and edit a bit more, but both of us have day jobs, are running companies, and contributing code.\nOne nice by-product of exploring video is that we get a chance to re-explain mouth-coding examples or overly visual concepts that were probably confusing on the audio podcast. As much as I love podcasting, the lack of visual examples for a visual field like Web Design and Development is a limitation. I like that the YouTube series is like supplementary material to ideas covered in the podcast, rather than a replacement.\nOkay! That’s it! I hope you enjoy the little foray into video.\nWatch on YouTube\nAnd I wouldn’t be a YouTuber if I didn’t say… Be sure to drop a like and subscribe, that really helps us out in the algorithm. And ring that bell for notifications when new videos come out.",

This was a good practice because the idea was now out of my head and I wouldn’t stay up at night thinking about it. Over time that grew to about eighty posts in different states of completeness and it became overwhelming. 16,000+ words, terribly organized.\nA flat folder full of alphabetically sorted markdown files was not intuitively useful. I had no idea which posts were most recent, which were almost done, and which needed to go away. Lots of those drafts were a zingy title and a vague one-liner of text. Reverse engineering my own ideas when I revisited them later was difficult. It became mentally taxing to manage my own blog.\nIn a fit of desperation, I took my posts one step away from “the met…",

What connection\nare they using (for example Wi-Fi, 2G) and so on. The answers to these questions\ncan affect product development decisions such as choosing the\ntechnologies to render the content. This report provides timeline data to inform\ndevelopers on these questions for a list of countries, such as the US, Brazil,\nJapan, and others. Three platforms are included when data is available: Android,\nWindows, and ChromeOS.\nLooking at the data, there might be some interesting things for developers to\nthink about. For example, in Japan on the Android platform, the majority of\nusers have five to eight cores, and the prevalence is quite a bit higher than in\nthe US, and much higher than in next billion user (NBU) countries. Another\nexample: if you look at RAM on Android, a very low percentage of Brazil devices\nhave RAM larger than 5 GB, which is much lower than in the US, and also lower\nthan India. We hope publishing information like this periodically will help\ndevelopers have a better understanding of the Chrome user device\ncharacteristics.\nThis data comes from usage statistics sent to Google from Chrome installations.\nIn Chrome, users can choose to send usage statistics and crash reports to Google\nto help improve Chrome's feature set and stability. Usage statistics and crash\nreports are enabled by default for Chrome consumer installs and can be disabled\nduring installation or in Chrome's settings. Metrics collection is pseudonymous,\nand metrics are tagged by an opaque per-install identifier that is not joinable\nwith other datasets.  If the metrics collection is re-enabled, the unique\nidentifier will also be reset. We used the data collected to calculate the\nvarious statistics in this\nreport.\nPhoto by Halacious on Unsplash",
