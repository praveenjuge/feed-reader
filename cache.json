Pressing Enter or Tab inserts them into your code.\nPerhaps you need something more custom? There are many extensions in the VS Code Marketplace that provide snippets in a variety of languages. Personally, I use Sarah Drasner’s Vue VS Code Snippets extension, which includes a whole bunch of snippets for Vue.\nWriting our own snippets\nBut we can also create our own snippets!

          "description": "If you’ve been writing CSS for any length of time, the chances are you’ll have come across situations where you need to hide some text visually, but still have that text available to assistive technologies (such as screenreaders). Icon buttons and skip links are just two examples. (There are plenty more.) Simply using display: none hides text from assistive technologies, which is not useful to us in this scenario. So developers over the years have come up with clever ways to hide text visually, which usually manifest as a utility class that gets copied and pasted into every project, often called .visually-hidden or .sr-only — something like:\n.sr-only {\n  border: 0 !important;\n  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px) !important;\n  -webkit-clip-path: inset(50%) !important;\n  clip-path: inset(50%) !important;\n  height: 1px !important;\n  overflow: hidden !important;\n  margin: -1px !important;\n  padding: 0 !important;\n  position: absolute !important;\n  width: 1px !important;\n  white-space: nowrap !important;\n}\nIt’s so common that even popular CSS frameworks like Tailwind come with built-in .sr-only classes.\nBut as Ben Myers points out in this excellent article on why the web needs this as a native feature, there are problems with this. One issue is that there are many variations on this snippet, which have been found to cause problems as browsers and have evolved over time. Ben argues that it’s about time this became a native feature, and I absolutely agree. In the article, Ben outlines some of the advantages and drawbacks to the various forms this might take, such as a value of the display property, a property all of its own, or a HTML attribute. I recommend giving it a read, and hopefully something will come out of it 🙂\nRead the article →",

It is then left to the receiving web server to determine if and how to use this information.\nWe want to protect the user's privacy by only sending this header on requests if the app developer explicitly opts in to share with services embedded within the WebView. To achieve this and let current online services that depend on this header migrate away from using it, we will run a Deprecation Origin Trial, while removing the header for general traffic. In parallel, we will be developing new privacy-preserving APIs (such as client attestation APIs) to match the use cases where the X-Requested-With header is being used today.\nYou can read more about why we're making this change and how it works over at the Android Developer's Blog in Improving user privacy by requiring opt-in to send X-Requested-With header from WebView.",

Apart from Google, project partners include Microsoft, Intel, Samsung, and others. The project enables amazing web applications like Photoshop by exposing the capabilities of the underlying operating systems to the web platform, while maintaining user security, privacy, trust, and other core tenets of the web.\nBut what are examples of apps that make use of these capabilities? Our answer to this question is the Project Fugu API Showcase. It is sourced by community submissions, and contains a filterable list of apps that make use of one or more of the Fugu APIs.\nPropose missing apps to the showcase by submitting them via an anonymous form. Submissions are reviewed regularly and the showcase will be updated accordingly.\nAfter living in an embedded iframe that didn't really allow the showcase to fully shine, we have now worked on migrating it to a new home, and have polished its look and feel a fair bit, too. Find the Project Fugu API Showcase at its new location developer.chrome.com/fugu-showcase!\nLaunch each app by clicking its name, screenshot, or the Launch app link. For many apps, you can also see the source code by clicking View source. On browsers that support the Web Share API, click Share app to do exactly that. As a special inception Easter egg, the Project Fugu API Showcase is of course contained in the Project Fugu API Showcase.\nBe sure to subscribe to the RSS feed so you never miss a new Fugu app.",

          "description": "I'm thrilled to share with you all a personal milestone in my life that I feel compelled to celebrate. My girlfriend, Julia, has been pursuing her dream of becoming a UX/UI designer for almost a year now while working in logistics, and today she has finally published her first project!\nI can't express how proud I am of her for putting in the hard work to make her dream a reality. It's not easy to balance work and study (you know, sleepless nights to chase a dream), but she has done it with great determination.\nNow that Julia has completed her first project, she's excited to take the next step in her journey and is actively searching for job opportunities in UX/UI design. If any of you have any leads or know of any open positions in this field, we would be immensely grateful for any advice or guidance you can offer.\nI know some of you may think it's a small feat, but to us, it's a significant accomplishment worth toasting. As a community of innovators and dreamers, I hope we can all take inspiration from Julia's story and strive to follow our passions relentlessly.\nLet's raise a glass to Julia and all the aspiring designers out there who are working hard to turn their dreams into reality. Cheers!\nHer project published on Behance: https://www.behance.net/gallery/166920067/TagPalette-UXUI-Design\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35320207\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Like many people here, I have been using ChatGPT almost since its launch. Considering the massive adoption, I am a bit surprised that the interface hasn't evolved one bit in 3 months.\nMy issues:\n-  Why is there no shortcut to my account/profile settings from ChatGPT's left panel?\n-  Why are my DALL-E money and ChatGPT/API money kept separate? These are two products from the same company, asking twice for my CC number.\n-  Why do I have to refresh my page manually every time something went wrong? Couldn't the page either refresh itself or recreate a clean connexion?\n-  Why isn't there a \"log in\" button from OpenAI's landing page, plus a SSO detecting that I am already connected and linking (for instance) to my account, the products I use, etc.?\n-  Why are their URLs so confusing? DALL-E is living at \"labs.openai.com\" (for the actual product) or \"openai.com/product/dall-e-2\" (for the product presentation). For ChatGPT it's \"chat.openai.com/chat\" (why \"chat\" twice btw?), but it's \"platform.openai.com/playground\" for the playground. Of course no page links to the others so you have to go back to the landing to access any of them (or access them through Google).\n-  And finally, why is the search on their website so bad? I was looking for the playground, but \"openai.com/search?q=playground\" sucked so much that I had to use Google to find it. And we are talking about an AI company indexing its own pages.\nI understand OpenAI has other important things to do right now, but these are minor issues that would take a mediocre dev a few days to fix. This would easily make me 10% happier with a 1/1000000th of the resources needed to improve their models. Also, remember that Google got huge in the beginning by caring about stuff like this. So, why does nobody care?\nEDIT: formatting\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35236635\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 2",

There is a lack of standardization in the industry, some mention compensation, some mention hard requirements, some are more flexible in requirements.\nI'm curious if you were to build a job description standard, what types of fields would you want included? Some ideas of the top of my head:\n- Compensation Bands\n- If hard requirements are present, an explanation of why (i.e we don't have capacity for mentorship, so we are looking for X years of work experience)\n- LinkedIn of the hiring manager\n- LinkedIn of the existing team\n- A detailed over of the interview process\nWould love to know what others think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35082448\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Hi HN! We just released the public alpha version of Mathesar (https://mathesar.org/, code: https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar).\nMathesar is an open source tool that provides a spreadsheet-like interface to a PostgreSQL database.\nI was originally inspired by wanting to build something like Dabble DB. I was in awe of their user experience for working with relational data. There’s plenty of “relational spreadsheet” software out there, but I haven’t been able to find anything with a comparable UX since Twitter shut Dabble DB down.\nWe're a non-profit project. The core team is based out of a US 501(c)(3).\nFeatures:\n* Built on Postgres: Connect to an existing Postgres database or set one up from scratch.\n* Utilizes Postgres Features:  Mathesar’s UI uses Postgres features. e.g. \"Links\" in the UI are foreign keys in the database.\n* Set up Data Models: Easily create and update Postgres schemas and tables.\n* Data Entry: Use our spreadsheet-like interface to view, create, update, and delete table records.\n* Data Explorer: Use our Data Explorer to build queries without knowing anything about SQL or joins.\n* Schema Migrations: Transfer columns between tables in two clicks in the UI.\n* Custom Data Types:: Custom data types for emails and URLs (more coming soon), validated at the database level.\nLinks:\nCODE: https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar\nLIVE DEMO: https://demo.mathesar.org/\nDOCS: https://docs.mathesar.org/\nCOMMUNITY: https://wiki.mathesar.org/en/community\nWEBSITE: https:/mathesar.org/\nSPONSOR US: https://github.com/sponsors/centerofci or https://opencollective.com/mathesar\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34999774\nPoints: 132\n# Comments: 32",

          "description": "I wrote a simple site that uses the HN API to save new submissions. Even if they're deleted on Hacker News, they'll be saved on hLog. It looks for new posts every 3 minutes.\nIt also has a basic search that looks at the title, url and submission text (if any).\nIt's not optimised in terms of pagination of results (nor the actual page content). If you press \"Search\" without anything in the search box, you'll get a list of all the records in the database. There are around 4,200 right now.\nI wrote it in Python (Django) using SQLite3. It runs on a free VPS hosted on Oracle Cloud. I wrote this mainly to improve my understanding of Django. I'm mainly a backend guy but i want to build some frontend skills and i thought a project like this would allow me to learn that.\nAny feedback would be much appreciated, even if it's negative. I know there are hundreds (if not thousands) of HN mirrors/clones out there, but this is for my learning. If you could suggest any improvements, i may be able to learn new things i otherwise wouldn't have.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34964104\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on ways to understand (intentional not saying measure) productivity of software engineers with metrics. I know it's a polarising topic and difficult to tackle. Usually the path of discussion goes to \"commits are not relevant\", \"my situation is unique\", \"requirements are changing\", and so forth. But in the same time, after so many projects delivered and considering the maturity of tooling we have today (acknowledging that this make it also very complex), there are many, many things which are kind of predictable and similar to other delivered products. Outside a small percentage of developers which work on innovations, r&d and areas which by nature are unpredictable, the vast majority are just doing the same stuff.\nSo what are your ways of understanding that someone is productive or not which is not based on gut, perception and other subjective factors?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35245329\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 8",

          "description": "Hi HN!\nI am quite excited as this is my second product, launched today: Versionfeeds.\nhttps://versionfeeds.com\nWhat is Versionfeeds? I was quite annoyed by the fact that I had no central place where I could see all the software releases. I use software a lot, be it at my job, to build my side projects, or tools hosted on my NAS at home. It's literally dozens, if not hundreds of tools, packages or even programming languages. And most of them receive updates regularly.\nThat is why I built Versionfeeds. It allows me to bundle all the releases for the software I need and love, into one dedicated feed. At the moment, all public repositories on Github and Gitlab are available. You can also search on npm (Javascript) and Packagist (PHP) for your software. More providers will come soon.\nThe feeds adhere to the Atom standard and can be consumed with any feed reader. If maintainers use markdown in their release notes, it will be converted to HTML.\nAny feedback, wishes and ideas are welcome. Please share your thoughts with me. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35069802\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "The Zone is the state where you are completely focused and fully productive. It takes time to get there, but the slightest distraction can knock you out of it and you have to start over.\nSo I built this app to track productivity and measure the impact of interruptions.\nThis is how it can help:\n• Launching the app and starting to get in the Zone is a commitment to work. It can prevent you from procrastinating and is a good motivator to actually start working and to keep distractions away.\n• The timer can help you decide if it’s a good time to take a pause because you’ve been in the Zone for a long period, or if it is better to continue working because you’ve just entered the Zone.\n• Your colleagues will notice the color change from yellow to red. This is a great signal that helps them understand the impact of interruptions on your productivity.\n• Statistics help you measure your daily productive time.\n• Using your phone for other purposes is considered an interruption by the app, so that’s already one distraction taken care of.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35010752\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "When I make applications on my own account that are server-side rendered I frequently use CSS to style things in a way similar to what I think CSS was intended for initially,  that is,  I apply styles to meaningful parts of the document (e.g. \"div.statusbar\", \"table.postlisting th\".)\nFrequently I work on these things on and off for months or years and eventually they become a hot mess.\nI'm looking for something that will help me have some discipline.  I do not like BEM, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and other frameworks that want to impose alien structures on CSS.  I like the intention of SASS/SCSS but don't like the idea of complicating my build system.  (I like the idea of CSS Nesting as it works in Chrome but Firefox doesn't have it yet unfortunately.  I want to use the latest features but I need support for Firefox and Mobile Safari with Chrome as a distant third.)  I would consider using a JS polyfill and I am using jinja2 template so anything I can bake into my python back end (maybe compile & cache compiled CSS) would be possible.\nAny advice for frameworks or other organizing principles?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35223553\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

In researching options for the project (Go based), I've \"discovered\" that there's a _lot_ more to templates than what I've used in the past (Jinja2 via Django, Flask, and Ansible).\nSo to the actual web developers here, what template engines do you use and why? I've never worked with compiled templates but they seem interesting, though I don't know their cost/benefit tradeoffs very well yet.\nYour choice of language, stack, syntax preference, what-have-you! I'm just genuinely curious about the broader templating ecosystem and workflows.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35061863\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 3",

          "description": "Building UI used to be fun when there were limited choices. You would use bootstrap and sass/less  or css modules, and just get things done.\nNow there are just so many options to choose from and such a feeling of FOMO.\nEach new one that comes out and moves up the rankings (https://2022.stateofcss.com/en-US/css-in-js/) makes me feel a need to evaluate it. There is always a little benefit from each new framework but then it also can make other things harder.\nI really just want nice pre-built components to use.\nTailwind has great components and templates, but its such a mess too look at when you want to deal with dynamic styles, and is slow to compile with webpack and tricky with monorepos, and then you have to use things like twind, twin.macro, windicss.\nI miss the days of jquery + sass so badly. It was so straightforward. Nested css for everything and then when you need complex stuff: just use jquery to add/remove styles.\nEvery single new framework has so many edge cases that just wear you down. Styled Components and Emotion seemed so great, but just so many freaking edge cases, and perf issues.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35039964\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 3",

Would love to know what you guys think.\nThe idea is to have something very simple to use that people can just download and use. If they want, tweak as per their liking. (You will need an OpenAI API to use it).\n- It doesn't call or use any 3rd party services (except jQuery and Bootstrap loaded from a CDN). Use your own API key, call the OpenAI API directly in its normal functioning ( there is a chatbot feature to pull top HN headlines which calls the HN API ).\n- Its just an HTML file, so you can run it from anywhere.\nRepo:\nhttps://github.com/dminGod/CallGPT\nDirect github pages demo: \nhttps://dmingod.github.io/CallGPT/chat_gpt.html\n- You can also use presets.

          "description": "Though it's only been a few days since my last entry I got to the end of that week and took some stock and realised, aloud, that I had a good week.\nAgain, this is for me and those who know me. The usual tech nonsense will resume (one day!).\n\nI hadn't written anything on my blog for a while, or at least nothing that had flowed naturally so my \"flavour of funk\" post did come easily and it was good.\nThe Monday before that post (the evening before) I attended a (nearly impromptu) meetup run under Beyond Tellerrand from Marc Thiele and Storyblok. I saw friends who I've not seen in, what felt like a long time. I felt physically sick the whole time, in my guts but seeing talks, hearing ideas, seeing my friends faces - it was overall positive.\nThe next day I finally returned to the gym. It was gentle and I wrote the aforementioned blog post on the treadmill. It flowed out of me and the responsive was warm and friendly (thank you).\nThat evening I also had dinner with a long standing friend. So long that we agreed that we'd meet on the same day every month - which makes making sure we see each other much easier. It was nice, and they'd read my post (and are probably reading this post too, so hey ❤️).\nFinally on the Thursday I started individual therapy (or counselling) properly (I'd had an introduction session the week before). I realised, and had to think carefully about it, that I had had a good week.\nIn the week that followed (last week), I've been trying to focus my thoughts on positive things to tell myself. I'm working on quietening down Bob's voice in my head, and when it's quiet, I'd like to begin to fill that emptiness with positive things, nice things, in my head.\nIt's still early days, like those early pages in a book, those first weeks on a diet or at the gym, but it's positive. I'm hopeful.",

USB micro has a 5th line, though when it's connected to USB A on the other side that 5th line isn't connected.\nMy problem is that I also have a boat load of power only USB cables - and there's no way to tell using a visual inspection. You can buy tools that tell you if there's a data line, but I can make one fairly simply.\n\nI should caveat this with the fact that I just happened to have the parts laying around.\nIn short\nThe device is an LED power a battery power source and the USB's data wire is used to complete the circuit.\nParts\n\nProtoboard\nUSB A port\nUSB micro port\nLED\n220ohm (ish) resistor\nBattery (I used a game boy cartridge battery - again I had them laying around)\n\nWiring\nIn my version, I've included separate LEDs and checks for both the D+ and the D- but it's not really necessary - if D+ isn't there, neither is D-.\nThe pinout on the USB ports is the important detail, the outside pins (far left and far right) are VCC and ground (which we don't care about).
