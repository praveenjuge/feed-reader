Big meetings of more than 50 people will get shoehorned into a six-hour window on Thursdays, with a limit of one a week.\nThis is fascinating to me.  I get the desire to remove bloated meetings, but there are recurring meetings that I find genuinely valuable to have sync (project standups / staff meetings).  Curious if this ends up being a long term policy for Shopify or more of a culture reset.",

It’s been a great year for the company, as we’ve taken on a bunch of exciting projects and continued to make a name for ourselves. The year has been full of interesting challenges and learning opportunities for me personally, working with Vue and D3.js in particular, (and AWS, which has been less fun 😅) and it’s been a pleasure to work with the friendly and knowledgeable team.

Sometimes a small typo might elude us, sometimes we make the odd factual error despite our best efforts and research. Sometimes we phrase something clumsily, giving the wrong impression, omit some piece of information (intentionally or unintentionally), or perhaps misinterpret something we’ve read elsewhere. I’m as guilty as anyone. Especially on this blog, where I don’t always have time to proofread as thoroughly as I should. I worry a lot about being “correct”, particularly as my readership has increased over the past few years, and always endeavour to ensure my articles are as accurate as possible.

My brain is wired to remember margin and padding shorthands (top, right, bottom, left), but when it comes to corners it’s a different story. Do I start from the top left corner, or the top right? So I usually resort to the longhand, which is admittedly verbose, but at least has the advantage of being explicit, for me and any future readers of my code. For the record, these are equivalent:\ndiv {\n  border-radius: 10% 20% 30% 75%;\n}\ndiv {\n  border-top-left-radius: 10%;\n  border-top-right-radius: 20%;\n  border-bottom-right-radius: 30%;\n  border-bottom-left-radius: 75%;\n}\nIn the shorthand, we start from the top left corner, and go round clockwise, ending with the bottom left.\nIronically,…",

This post is for RSS subscribers only.\nRead more about RSS Club.\n\nAfter a good long hem n’ haw about Texas politics my friend Daniel filled a conversational pause by jokingly asking…\n“So what’s good?”\nA question made in jest, but it has stuck in me like a knife. I now see my ability to complain everywhere. On the walk to school with neighbors they ask how it’s going, “Ughck. I’m busy”, or “Ughck. It’s hot”, or “Ughck. Kids putting on shoes, amirite?!”\nI’m trying to figure this out. It’s starting to bother me because I don’t believe myself to be a negative or overly pessimistic person. But there are times I hear the vibe-killing “Debbie Downer” sludge pouring out of my mouth.\nThe best I can come up with is…\nI think it’s easier to complain? My negativity bias bubbling to the surface. Is it easier for humans to commiserate on bad circumstances rather than celebrate good ones?\nIt’s an attempt to self-deprecate? Life is going good but I don’t want you to think it’s going too good.\nMy engineering brain? I spend every day finding and predicting problems, is my brain over-tuned to find problems?\nEither that or I’m a big ol’ StrongSad. Hm.",

          "description": "Psst… I’ve been keeping a secret. As part of my Web Components course on Frontend Masters, I built an entire guidebook on how to get started with Web Components. A Web Components 101. I spent hundreds of hours preparing the materials for the course and I’m excited to announce that today I’m making the guidebook public for everyone to get started with Web Components.\nRead the Guidebook\nThis guidebook is different! Most Web Component resources drop you right into the JavaScript parts. Ughck. That’s fine, I guess, but seeing the markup for a <my-button> component doesn’t make my heart or brain sing. It also doesn’t help me understand one of Web Components’ biggest mental hurdles: The Shadow DOM. To overcome this, I’ve intentionally designed my course to build out layer-by-layer from HTML→CSS→JavaScript, like how old timers learned the web development in the past.\nStarting with <template> and <slot> –and most certainly with Web Component styling– you become familiar with the quirks of Shadow DOM first before writing your own from scratch. Following the navigation from left-to-right you’ll learn the ins-and-outs of Using → Styling → Writing the different flavors of Web Components. And because it’s part of the Web Platform, that knowledge will always be valuable.\nHTML-first may seem overly basic, but I find that lots of new and experienced developers alike have never even tried using a Web Component off the shelf. That’s my favorite part of Web Components! You can use lots of Web Components without a build process or any kind of Webpack sorcery. A script tag + HTML and you’re using them! Web Components make it easy to (dependably) use other people’s code.\nYou can of course still watch my Web Components course on Frontend Masters. I recommend it if you’re an visual or auditory learner like myself. There’s also a bit more back-and-forth with the live audience and their questions.",

          "description": "I watched the documentary General Magic (mentioned in Tony Fadell’s book Build) about the 1990s Apple spin-off company General Magic that built the iPhone before the iPhone. Ultimately the product was a commercial failure, but the documentary is a wonderful look at product design and what happens when you let talented engineers roam free range. They invented USB, created capacitive touch screen GUIs, and imagined the portable “Post-PC” world before Windows 95 and the Internet were ever popular. Ultimately the product was a failure, too early for its time. How did they build this product? Well the answer is… prototypes.\nMy favorite part of the documentary is Megan Smith beaming over her cabinet full of hardware prototypes. Her focus on making something people love, an intimate device, is infectious. Her eagerness to blend everyone’s wishes with the harsh reality of available and affordable hardware shows. Starting with off-the-shelf components and inventing if necessary. When describing the product, she’s not talking about megabytes, protocols, and pixels, but talking about the sound, the feeling, the touch of the product and software in people’s hands.\nI feel more vindicated than ever that prototypes, put in people’s hands, are the biggest opportunity to capture lightning in a bottle. These people are imagining and building the iPhone 17 years before the iPhone launched. Megan Smith talks like Steve Jobs, but Steve Jobs doesn’t work at Apple or General Magic. We often herald the invention of the iPhone or Android and these magic devices as invented out of thin air or our collective science fiction, but both of those products used by billions of people rose from the ashes of General Magic’s failure. That’s a lot to dwell on. The composting of failures produces rich and fertile soil.",

Writing, code, art… all with computers nipping at the heels with competency and speed. Fascinating. Unexpected in my lifetime. A mild bit alarming, but fascinating nonetheless.\nI don’t think it’s all bad, but my brain is still ramping up to the new reality that these handicrafts have (likely) been permanently altered. We should celebrate the lower bar for creative endeavors; you no longer need to be an expert at Photoshop to produce a creative image, just an expert at generating prompts. People are extracting beautiful artifacts from these machines. Incredible.\nAs interesting a future this creates, I’m a member of an old caste of people that still believes massive gains don’t come without realized costs; or more explicitly, electricity isn’t the only cost. What if the cost we’re paying is our perception of reality itself? It’s increasingly likely that the next thing you read or watch is the product of a content extruder. Your favorite author, artist, creator, influencer, job applicant, or manager; the curtain pulled back to reveal a series of six word prompts.

This early stable version will be released to a small percentage of users, with the majority of people getting the release a week later at the normal scheduled date, this will also be the date the new version is available from the Chrome download page.\nFor Chrome 110 the key dates will be:\nBeta: January 12, 2023\nEarly Stable: February 1, 2023\nStable: February 7, 2023\nYou can keep track of upcoming release dates and included features on the Chrome Status Roadmap, and on the Chromium Dashboard. The beta posts have more details of features, and any deprecations and removals for each release.\n# Why are we making this change?\nBy releasing stable to a small percentage of users early, we get a chance to monitor the release before it rolls out to all of our users. If any showstopping issue is discovered, it can be addressed while the impact is relatively small.\nFor most developers this change will have little impact. Keep following this blog for up to date information on features and any upcoming deprecations and removals.

          "description": "What - I am working on a specification/language which can describe a traditional system design process for web-services.\nWhy - Having a language for system-design will improve design interviews and system documentation. It can also give rise to \"Competitive Designing\" industry same as \"Competetive Programming\" exists currently.\nHow - I am exploring existing specs (Docker-compose, OpenAPI and UML) and a way to merge them. They will define the system.\nFor the actual execution, I will use the spec to setup a sandbox environments and run blank instances of services in them. Then I would use custom defined API flows from the spec to simulate an actually running system.\nThis is not the hard part. The hard part is finding a way to benchmark these API flows which gives reliable scores for the effectiveness of the system for a given problem and API flows.\nHappy to discuss more.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34271635\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "As seen with things like open source software, many developer tools, Hacker News as a website and people's opinions on CSS and modern web design on places like Reddit?\nCause it feels like many people's tastes come from the 80s/early 90s, with the idea that any sort of visual flourish or attempt at readability is completely irrelevant.\nAnd it makes me wonder why this is. Why do so many... hacker type individuals seem to prefer very brutalist, utilitarian designs over anything more fancy? Where did this preference for plain text at the expense of all else come from anyway?\nBecause I don't think this happens quite as much in other fields, like architecture, cooking or construction.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34246340\nPoints: 35\n# Comments: 78",

          "description": "I like how ActivityPub can be implemented on any website and provide a good set of endpoints to enable rich, social-media-like content interactions. I'd love to enable my current website to respond to those requests, but I don't want to either use \"activitypub-express\" or install a full Mastodon (or any other) server just for myself.\nMy idea was to implement the protocol myself, which would be a nice way to learn it and its problems. But I would also love to make it a library that can be applied by others on their own, already existing websites.\nThe problem that I am having is that the current methods to implement this kind of pluggable extension involve connecting to one specific back end framework, such as creating an Express middleware.\nWhat I was thinking was:\n- Use TypeScript (to leverage the large JS community)\n- Make it as vanilla as possible\n- Use fetch standards such as the Request and Response objects, which are available natively since Node 18\n- Provide multiple adapters for common frameworks such as Express, Fastify, Next.js, Astro, etc\nIs this solved elegantly on any other language or framework?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34037748\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

I know everyone has different preferences and work styles, but I can’t help but think what I’ve been able to apply would be useful for other developers at my company.\nUndoubtedly, there are other developers at my company have their own set of programs/workflows they use to increase their efficiency that I think could be useful to me and others.\nI'm curious to know what strategies other developers use or have used within their company to share productivity tips and programs with their colleagues. For example, is there a dedicated Teams/Slack channel, an internal wiki, or some other type of software where engineers can share/demo programs and shortcuts they use in their day-to-day work?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34330634\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I've been experimenting with a smart RSS reader and I've been using Superfeedr to ingest content.  Superfeedr monitors RSS feeds and calls a webhook when content arrives,  I stuff these into an Amazon SQS and then spool them out at my leisure.\nMy system requires a fairly high volume (1000's of articles) to train a machine learning model so I have been focusing on high volume feeds like preprints from the arXiv,  news from the Guardian, etc.\nNow Superfeedr charges 10¢ per feed per month,  my bill right now is $3 a month.  It's reasonable that I can subscribe to about 100 feeds on Superfeedr but subscribing to 1000 feeds seems pricey to me.\nThere are a lot of independent blogs out there that publish an article every week or every six months.  What they all have in common is that somebody has to poll an RSS file many many many times per article ingested.  W/ superfeedr it makes for high costs but it is a hassle even if I built my own RSS ingest system.\nOne thing that would help would be consolidated RSS feeds that aggregate posts from a large number of blogs.  Are there good ones out there?  Are there other answers to problem of polling hundreds or thousands of independent blogs?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34330134\nPoints: 11\n# Comments: 9",

          "description": "I wrote an RSS reader called RSS Brain recently. The motivate is the current RSS readers either don't sort articles by priority, which makes it hard to read posts from HackerNews and Reddit, or sort it with some \"smart\" algorithm which I don't trust. I also like the Google News feature that can show related story from different source, but the sources are not configurable and the algorithm is not transparent either. So with RSS Brain, I implemented these features:\n* Recommend related articles from the feeds of your choice. It's backed by ElasticSearch and the algorithm is described on RSS Brain's website.\n* Option to sort articles by upvotes and time. The algorithm is similar to the old Reddit and you can find it on the website as well.\n* Save search terms into folders so you can filter the articles.\nI've been using it for a while and found these features very helpful. So I want to share this on HackerNews. The frontend is written in Flutter so it has cross platform clients, even though the web version don't feel very \"web native\" because the level of Flutter web support. I guess only time can improve that.\nI don't have enough hardware to scale it up so it's currently in subscription mode to limit the users. I'm going to open source the code (maybe non-commercial license) once I think it's ready so you can host it by yourself. It's still in early stage and haven't been tested by a lot of people. So any feedback is helpful. Thanks!\nUpdate: Added a scroll down hint in the landing page. Thanks for the feedback.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34188734\nPoints: 66\n# Comments: 52",

After weeks of trying to get support to track down this bug, we finally got this response\n\"Thank you for your patience while my team looks at this. We were able to confirm that the best time range currently to space the blog posts is 10-12 hours before Mailchimp's sending time. There just isn't enough time between your posts and the feed to pull the new content.\nAs a best practice, I would plan your content releases a day in advance with this functionality in mind.\"\nIt started with 4 hours, now they are telling us 10-12 hours in advance? My client runs a news site and sends our daily news. It's not always possible to even publish content that far in advance. It's insane to me that this functionality was working fine, for years. That they have managed to break and instead of fixing are saying just publish an insane amount of time ahead of the newsletter being sent?\nI'm not sure what it takes to get someone's attention at MailChimp to actually fix this. Read the RSS feed before sending the scheduled post. Like it used to. Otherwise, what newsletter providers would people recommend replacing MailChimp with?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34102591\nPoints: 7\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "At one point during the construction of my house, we needed designs for the kitchen and bathroom cabinets and a bedroom wardrobe.\nI wanted full control of the design process. Doing it in vector illustration software was too painful and it was taking too long. But I didn't have the time to learn any complex CAD tool either.\nSo I developed a small HTML/JS/CSS tool for designing MDF furniture by writing my own little language that transpiles into a CSS grid layout.\nTake a look at the blog post for details:\nhttps://alnvdl.github.io/2023/01/07/designing-furniture-usin...\nOr go directly to the tool (works best on desktop or tablet): https://alnvdl.github.io/squareplanner/\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34290524\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I've came to deep realization that CSS is the most important  thing for building a website. It holds the key to becoming full stack developer or just a backend developer. It's everything in frontend.\nSooner or later, you'll need vanilla css. You can't depend on bootcrap or failwindcss. Your site looks like same if you do so. And many components aren't available there.\nThere are components like carousel, cards hover etc etc..How to polish all these skills?\nIs there a course for it?\nI try to practice it like randomly, but there are no tutorials. I'm not at a phase where I can read complex long code and  decode it.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34128451\nPoints: 10\n# Comments: 10",

That's all.\nThere are various components in a website though. I'd like to be able to build any of them whenever required if I'm in a job.\nI wanted to build a timeline using html and css but it's not entering my head at all. I've seen codes from multiple websites.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/L7c1Bkj\nThis is the timeline that I want to build. Looks pretty simple but I'm unable to build it. How do I deal with stuffs like this? How do I learn these stuffs?\nIs there a course that helps to deal with these stuffs? There's no point of having learn CSS if I can't build these stuffs with my visualization. Please guide me.\nThe scary thing here is that if I can't build these stuffs then there is 0 point of me learning css.

          "description": "Back in the day (late 90s), Microsoft had a format called \"HTML Application.\"\nIt was just an HTML page with a \".hta\" file extension. Opening such a file would open it in a chrome-less browser, and give the scripting in the page access to the file system.\nI used to love these things. I wrote a bunch of little apps in them.\nSome examples:\nhttps://medium.com/@anht_59851/html-application-hta-a-gui-for-your-scripting-on-windows-bfaacf2c3bdd\nThese still exist, but there are problems with them:\n1. Coding is a bear. They run in the mshta.exe process, and that spawns an instance of... IE9, I think? There's no \"inspect\" panel, for instance, and errors just pop a modal with no debugging information.\n2. Near as I can tell, they use an older version of ECMAScript. \"let\" doesn't seem to work, not does \"addEventListener,\" etc. I kept getting weird \"Syntax Errors\" for things that appeared to be valid, contemporary JavaScript.\n3. I'm quite sure some security software (like on my laptop, issued by employer), blocks these from executing.\nWhat's the current-day equivalent of these?  I want to write an HTML page complete with CSS and JS, double-click on it from my desktop, have it open in a browser instance of its own, and have access to the file system.\nI essentially want a way to create little GUI apps, without having to use WinForms.\nWhat am I looking for? Is it Electron?\n(Note: I'm on Windows)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34014642\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",
