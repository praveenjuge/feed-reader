To improve network performance, these tools compress the code into a single line, remove unnecessary characters, and shorten variables.\nMany tools can generate source maps to accompany your code.\nChrome DevTools reads both the deployed code and source maps and lets you debug your code as you normally would, even with breakpoints.\nTo better understand how source maps work, check out the source maps visualizer.\nAdditionally, source maps can have extensions. If you build tools and frameworks, consider supporting them. Check out this Case Study: Better Angular Debugging with DevTools, where the DevTools Team and Angular improved the debugging experience in DevTools by supporting the x_google_ignoreList extension.\nTo learn more, see:\nIntroduction to JavaScript Source Maps\nWhat are source maps?\nDebug your original code instead of deployed with source maps",

We will require a crowd of 50 users per creative within the past 7 days before the ad can be rendered.

It is then left to the receiving web server to determine if and how to use this information.\nWe want to protect the user's privacy by only sending this header on requests if the app developer explicitly opts in to share with services embedded within the WebView. To achieve this and let current online services that depend on this header migrate away from using it, we will run a Deprecation Origin Trial, while removing the header for general traffic. In parallel, we will be developing new privacy-preserving APIs (such as client attestation APIs) to match the use cases where the X-Requested-With header is being used today.\nYou can read more about why we're making this change and how it works over at the Android Developer's Blog in Improving user privacy by requiring opt-in to send X-Requested-With header from WebView.",

          "description": "At work, we recently discussed the issues arising from UX/UI designers using visual tools like Figma or Sketch to create mockups that front-end developers have to manually reverse-engineer into HTML/CSS. While these tools provide useful means of visual expression, they often lead to developers having to infer design vocabulary from the mockups themselves, causing a loss of value and potential misinterpretations.\nAs a community, how can we bridge the gap between visual and text-based web design to preserve design reasoning and intent? Are there better ways to communicate design requirements without relying solely on visual mockups? How can we emphasize the importance of a clear connection between description and visual presentation in modern web design tools to avoid costly mistakes and improve accessibility?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35386850\nPoints: 7\n# Comments: 5",

Here’s a video: https://player.vimeo.com/video/797476910.\nGetting from a product idea to a design is too hard. Wireframing tools (e.g. Balsamiq) are limited and their output is too low-fidelity to get people excited about the idea. On the other hand, high-fidelity design tools (e.g. Figma) require advanced skills and are better for tweaking fine details than hashing out a big picture. Meanwhile, companies have an insatiable need to make new screens and change existing ones, and hiring more designers is time-consuming and expensive.\nDavid and I were on the design tools team at Airbnb when we realized there’s another solution: let designers encode their knowledge (e.g. design rules …",

          "description": "Hi HN, I'm Chun Rapeepat.\nLast week I started playing with GPT-4 and tried different ways to use it to optimize my dev workflow. It was fun, and I was just blown away by what GPT-4 can do.\nThe idea of CodePrompt first came to mind when I read \"Show HN: GPT Repo Loader – load entire code repos into GPT prompts\" [1]. It was precisely what I wanted to do! So I tried it.\nThe GPT Repo Loader works pretty well on a small codebase; However, due to its limitations in loading all files and content into the prompt, I still ran into token context limit issues and needed to copy/edit the code myself.\nThat's when I started working on CodePrompt. Instead of loading the entire repo, why not just load only relevant files or portions of code (or function headers?) that need for the requirement?\nHow I designed the user journey of CodePrompt.xyz:\n1. Choose a GPT model.\n2. Select a repo that you want to work with.\n3. Pick the relevant files that you want to include in the prompt.\n4. Add specific instructions and remove irrelevant codes as needed.\n5. Copy the prompt to your chosen GPT model to generate the desired output. Chat & Iterate.\n6. If you want to do something else, just go to (3) again.\nThis allows me to easily generate prompts to do something like \n- Implement features that evolve edits on multiple files\n- Create new components while reusing existing codebase\n- Generate code with the same style as other files, etc.\nI would love to hear all your feedback and ideas on how I can improve it. Or if you want to chat, feel free to ping me on my Twitter @chunrapeepat.\nP.S. The project is 100% open-source and free to use. \nCheck it out: https://github.com/chunrapeepat/codeprompt\n[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35191303\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35370579\nPoints: 5\n# Comments: 2",

There are a couple of challenges that I can think of:\n- many bidders for a specific item requiring multiple nodes\n- accepting a bid is a transaction?\n- ordering of bids as they come in\n- invalidating bids once and reflecting that to a customer very quickly\nUsually systems that are distributed that also need to be fast choose eventual consistency, but I am not sure how that would work in a bidding environment.

          "description": "I'm thrilled to share with you all a personal milestone in my life that I feel compelled to celebrate. My girlfriend, Julia, has been pursuing her dream of becoming a UX/UI designer for almost a year now while working in logistics, and today she has finally published her first project!\nI can't express how proud I am of her for putting in the hard work to make her dream a reality. It's not easy to balance work and study (you know, sleepless nights to chase a dream), but she has done it with great determination.\nNow that Julia has completed her first project, she's excited to take the next step in her journey and is actively searching for job opportunities in UX/UI design. If any of you have any leads or know of any open positions in this field, we would be immensely grateful for any advice or guidance you can offer.\nI know some of you may think it's a small feat, but to us, it's a significant accomplishment worth toasting. As a community of innovators and dreamers, I hope we can all take inspiration from Julia's story and strive to follow our passions relentlessly.\nLet's raise a glass to Julia and all the aspiring designers out there who are working hard to turn their dreams into reality. Cheers!\nHer project published on Behance: https://www.behance.net/gallery/166920067/TagPalette-UXUI-Design\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35320207\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Like many people here, I have been using ChatGPT almost since its launch. Considering the massive adoption, I am a bit surprised that the interface hasn't evolved one bit in 3 months.\nMy issues:\n-  Why is there no shortcut to my account/profile settings from ChatGPT's left panel?\n-  Why are my DALL-E money and ChatGPT/API money kept separate? These are two products from the same company, asking twice for my CC number.\n-  Why do I have to refresh my page manually every time something went wrong? Couldn't the page either refresh itself or recreate a clean connexion?\n-  Why isn't there a \"log in\" button from OpenAI's landing page, plus a SSO detecting that I am already connected and linking (for instance) to my account, the products I use, etc.?\n-  Why are their URLs so confusing? DALL-E is living at \"labs.openai.com\" (for the actual product) or \"openai.com/product/dall-e-2\" (for the product presentation). For ChatGPT it's \"chat.openai.com/chat\" (why \"chat\" twice btw?), but it's \"platform.openai.com/playground\" for the playground. Of course no page links to the others so you have to go back to the landing to access any of them (or access them through Google).\n-  And finally, why is the search on their website so bad? I was looking for the playground, but \"openai.com/search?q=playground\" sucked so much that I had to use Google to find it. And we are talking about an AI company indexing its own pages.\nI understand OpenAI has other important things to do right now, but these are minor issues that would take a mediocre dev a few days to fix. This would easily make me 10% happier with a 1/1000000th of the resources needed to improve their models. Also, remember that Google got huge in the beginning by caring about stuff like this. So, why does nobody care?\nEDIT: formatting\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35236635\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Hi everyone!\nAron (@arondeparon) here, founder of Gistreader.com.\nI was an avid user of Google Reader back in the day, but for some reason, I silently rolled over when they decided to kill it and never looked at RSS again.\nLately, I am getting more and more frustrated by the fact that most of the content that I consume is being pushed at me by some kind of algorithm. I wanted more control over this process, so decided to build GistReader.\nIn its basic form, GistReader is an RSS reader that aims to make your reading experience as fast and pleasant as possible. In addition to that, it uses AI to automatically create summaries of your articles and uses text-to-speech to optionally read a condensed version of an article to you out loud.\nGistReader is my first-ever product launch, so as you might expect, I'm pretty nervous about that, especially when it comes to sharing it on HN :)\nPlease, feel free to let me know what you think. It's all very early-days (lots of things I want to fix/improve/build) and the only way I can improve is by getting solid feedback from people that might actually use it.\nThanks!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35516274\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

However, it seems the new owner has lost interest - more and more bugs keep showing up and there is no way to contact support. So I'm looking for a new reader. It would be great if it had a fast, minimalist web interface, mobile support, generous free tier (long enough for me to decide whether I like the service or not) and customer support.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35440641\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 3",

          "description": "I ask this because so often I see people recommending tools and techniques by saying things like \"this dramatically increased my productivity!\" or \"this sped up my workflow by an order of magnitude!\"\nHow can we take such claims seriously? Most things do not improve our productivity THAT much. However, some things truly do.\nLet me give some examples of things I think truly have \"dramatically improved\" my productivity.\n  - testing, specifically integration tests\n  - memory safety (garbage collection, borrow checker, etc.)\n  - version control (git, etc.)\n  - closures and lambdas\n  - unix pipes and the idea of composing larger programs out of smaller ones\n  - Chrome debugger when working with javascript\n    - I hesitate to say \"debuggers\" in general because I actually think GDB didn't \"dramatically\" improve my productivity back when I programmed in C. And I don't even use a debugger at all when I program in python. But the Chrome debugger has numerous features I use all the time.\n\n  - static type systems\n    - could be a small win but I don't find myself \"dramatically more productive\"\n  - TDD\n  - IDEs\n    - some IDEs are better than others, but I have yet to experience a dramatic increase in productivity simply by using a new IDE. Text editor + terminal is pretty strong tbh.\n  - serverless architecture\n    - I could see the argument for scaling concerns, but at a smaller scale I don't see a productivity boost compared to a monolith Rails/Django app\n  - classes and class-style OOP, inheritance\n    - I haven't written a class in a long time, and I haven't used inheritance in a REALLY long time. I just don't think these are huge wins in most cases. Note that I'm not even advocating for FP here. I program in a procedural style most of the time in all honesty.\n\nThanks! I look forward to seeing the replies.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35350969\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

I know it's a polarising topic and difficult to tackle. Usually the path of discussion goes to \"commits are not relevant\", \"my situation is unique\", \"requirements are changing\", and so forth. But in the same time, after so many projects delivered and considering the maturity of tooling we have today (acknowledging that this make it also very complex), there are many, many things which are kind of predictable and similar to other delivered products. Outside a small percentage of developers which work on innovations, r&d and areas which by nature are unpredictable, the vast majority are just doing the same stuff.\nSo what are your ways of understanding that someone is productive or not which is not based on gut, perception and other subjective factors?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35245329\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 8",

          "description": "Hi, I've been playing around with doc2.site which uses Google Docs to create web pages. I tried several Chat GPT plugins to enhance my doc content with semantics like headings, emphasised text etc.\nThe problem is I always get plain text responses from Chat GPT (and plugins) even if you ask for the HTML output and then if you copy paste the output into Google Docs, you get the HTML tags like \nblah\n.I found a script that does copy the output as HTML:\n\"const blob = new Blob([html], {type: 'text/html'});\" so it's super easy actually but I couldn't find a plugin that handles it nicely like a copy paste response as HTML button.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35449723\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "When I make applications on my own account that are server-side rendered I frequently use CSS to style things in a way similar to what I think CSS was intended for initially,  that is,  I apply styles to meaningful parts of the document (e.g. \"div.statusbar\", \"table.postlisting th\".)\nFrequently I work on these things on and off for months or years and eventually they become a hot mess.\nI'm looking for something that will help me have some discipline.  I do not like BEM, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and other frameworks that want to impose alien structures on CSS.  I like the intention of SASS/SCSS but don't like the idea of complicating my build system.  (I like the idea of CSS Nesting as it works in Chrome but Firefox doesn't have it yet unfortunately.  I want to use the latest features but I need support for Firefox and Mobile Safari with Chrome as a distant third.)  I would consider using a JS polyfill and I am using jinja2 template so anything I can bake into my python back end (maybe compile & cache compiled CSS) would be possible.\nAny advice for frameworks or other organizing principles?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35223553\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

There was also some gunk inside the device, which again, just needed cleaning.\nThe touch screen, after testing, was fine too.

But in future, there's easier contact points to jump to.\nOtherwise, now all the buttons work, and TIL: mash the shoulder buttons can equate to a totalled joycon!",
