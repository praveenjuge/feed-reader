          "description": "WebPageTest is a great tool for measuring your website’s performance, providing detailed metrics and actionable advice. They’ve just released a brand new add-on, Carbon Capture, which measures the CO2 emissions generated by a website. It includes detailed breakdowns on which resources have the greatest carbon impact, as well as quantifying the total emissions. Read all about it in this blog post by Scott Jehl at WebPageTest.\nThis is awesome in terms of providing more visibility to developers on the environmental impact of the products we build. I hope it will help provide greater incentives for debt and their clients to prioritise performance and sustainability. Perhaps in the not too distant future we’ll see these metrics as a standard part of developer tools, making carbon awareness fully mainstream.\nWe should also remember these are estimated emissions, using our best available resources for measuring our websites carbon emissions right now, as Fershad writes in his excellent article Is data transfer the best proxy for website carbon emissions?. But hopefully it won’t be too long before we see these tools proving a more accurate picture.\nVideo: Building a Greener Web\nI gave a talk at All Day Hey conference recently about why this stuff matters, and some practical steps we as developers can take to reduce the environmental impact of the products we build. Watch it here to learn more.",

          "description": "There are lots of areas where better web performance and reducing carbon emissions overlap: faster websites are often less carbon-intensive ones. They transfer less data, cache efficiently, and make fewer requests, all of which reduce energy consumption.\nI’ve been consolidating a bunch of resources for an upcoming talk on Building a Greener Web. Here are a few resources you might find useful for building faster (and greener) websites.\nReducing the Site-Speed Impact of Third-Party Tags\nAn article by web performance consultant Andy Davies on the performance impact of third party scripts and tags, and what we can do to mitigate them. I’ve used many of the tips in the article, with very successful results.\nRead the article\nHow To Convert Variable TTF Font Files to WOFF2\nVariable fonts can be great for performance. They enable us to load multiple weights and styles of a particular font from a single font file. Unfortunately a lot of them are only available as TTF files, which tend to be significantly larger than WOFF2, despite WOFF2 being well-supported. Henry DesRoches details how to use Google’s WOFF2 converter library to convert variable fonts from TTF to WOFF2.\nRead the article\nCache Control for Civilians\nIf, like me, your knowledge of caching is pretty minimal, you could do worse than check out this article on cache-control headers by Harry Roberts. You’ll soon know your no-cache from your must-revalidate.\nRead the article",

I hadn’t realized View Transitions for multi-page apps (MPAs) and static sites are ready for testing behind a flag in Chrome 113+. View Transitions for MPAs are a feature that’s high on my CSS wishlist, so I got to it. It took less than an hour to do, requires zero JavaScript, and two lines of CSS. I’m pleased with the results.\n\n⚠️ At the time of writing this only work well in Chrome Canary 115+. I cannot fix this for you in other browsers. For browsers that don’t have multi-page View Transitions turned on by default (literally all of them) your pages will load like normal pages. This technique is a ✨ wonderful progressive enhancement.\nLet’s get started adding View Transitions to our site…\n1. Enabl…",

Lego is admittedly awesome, but for me the mental model of assembling Lego bricks in the required order until a Jira ticket can be marked as “done” feels too linear and too rigid for how I like to work.\nRobb’s post is a wonderful celebration of non-linear production flows. I’m a fan and agree that assembling LEGO bricks can be boring and a bit industrial, it certainly takes a different mindset. I have strong opinions that Big Agile is actually the wrong answer for most creative collaboration work, creative work is much better suited by a prototyping demo loop or a hot-potato process to overcome the tension between design and development, but that’s another topic…\nWhile I a…",

While the haunting drone sound it produces is enchanting, it strikes me as something a medieval software engineer would conjure up so they could play the viola without actually knowing how to play the viola.\nDrawing a bow is too difficult… let’s add a hand-cranked wheel\nFingering the strings is too difficult… let’s add some piano keys\nFiddles are too portable… let’s make it large and cumbersome\nThe “improvements” here create an object that couldn’t be more different in aesthetic and timbre than its relatives. One is sweet, nimble; it serenades. The other grinds like endlessly like a cat in a vice; a groaning wooden automaton.\nAs much as I dislike the hurdy-gurdy as a concept, history shows that the hurdy-gurdy democratized music and lowered the bar for people to create (loud) music.

          "description": "One of my favorite ideas for Twitter was by Oliver Reichenstein in a post called “Make Bots Identifiable”. Oliver makes the case that apps should notify users if the author of the post is a feed, a bot, or an actual human and the UI of the application should reflect that accordingly. The example Oliver gives is setting bot text into monospace and giving it an obvious 🤖 icon.\n\nIt’s a simple premise: “make bots identifiable”. Think of how this would neuter Russian disinformation worldwide. It would expose the underbelly of buying bot followers, exposing fake influencers and hustlers as social and political frauds. This, of course, depends on social media companies running bot analysis on their users, which they’d never do because it would pollute the New Users Chart Goes Brrrr metrics that Wall Street loves.\nOn Mastodon, however, you can self-identify your account as a human or a bot. Not every feed/bot account does this and not every Mastodon client reflects this option in their UI, but one that does is Elk. Bots in the main feed get a small 🤖 icon, like in Oliver’s dream! I decided to use Arc’s Boosts feature to add some custom CSS to make the text monospace for an even more obvious effect.\n\n/* Elk.zone */\ndiv[flex]:has([i-mdi\\:robot-outline]) .status-body {\n  font-family: monospace;\n}\n\n\nThe result is obvious and clear.\n\nSimple selector, not the cleanest, but got to use :has(). It’d be nice if more Mastodon clients (or Twitter, or YouTube, or Twitch, or Bluesky, or whatever’s next) surfaced this kind of information in the main feed. Anyways…\nArc Boosts are cool 😎\nAdd human-readable classnames and allow humans to change your site if they want (or need) to\nMake the Web more human",

          "description": "Videoconferencing brings us together, even when we're thousands of miles apart. Whether it's catching up with your best friend, or having a quick meeting with a coworker, video calls have become an integral part of our lives.\nState of the art video codecs such as AV1 can dramatically improve video call quality, while using less bandwidth to transmit higher quality video.  We're now seeing AV1 hardware encoders in desktops and laptops, but what about users who have older devices?\nThe Chrome Open Media team has worked for the last 18 months to make the AV1 software encoder (libaom) much faster, unlocking better quality AV1 video calling on all devices. Chrome 113 includes libaom v3.6.0, which greatly improves real-time communications performance—both speed and quality—for speeds 6 through 10. In particular we added a \"Speed 10\" setting for devices with limited CPU capabilities.\nGoogle Meet has tested AV1 successfully in extremely low bandwidth conditions—down to 40 kbps—which unlocks video calling to users whose poor Internet connections previously prevented them from making video calls.  Users with better Internet connectivity get improved video calls.  Compared to VP9 speed 7, AV1 Speed 10 provides 12% better quality at the same bandwidth, while running 25% faster on desktops.\nThe 3.6.0 release of libaom also includes improvements targeting screen sharing. Compared to VP9 speed 7, AV1 Speed 10 provides 45% better compression while running 35% faster.\nStarting with Chrome 113 any WebRTC app can take advantage of these AV1 improvements.\n# Resources\nThe full source code for libaom 3.6.0.\nThe Getting Started guide for WebRTC.\n# Acknowledgments\nMany thanks to the entire Chrome Open Media team for their work on AV1, especially Jerome Jiang, Marco Paniconi, Chi Yo Tsai, and Yunqing Wang.

          "description": "I'm seeing it's a common theme, especially in the Python community, to implement tightly coupled UIs and business logic. It's done in the name of convenience, but inevitably backfires once you go past trivial applications.\nI've lived the whole evolution of web-based applications, back when CSS didn't exist and PHP was something added to HTML to make it \"dynamic\". I'm glad web development has evolved; I think everyone is. But why do we have to go back to it, repackage it as something cool and make the same mistakes?\nI understand it's appealing to those whose title isn't \"software engineer\", because MVC can be a pain. Should it be though?\nI'm working in this space, building a state-driven half no-code/half Python framework , but rather than driving more attention to it I'd like to discuss the premise.\nIs this a battle worth fighting? Or am I making a big deal out of something no one cares about?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35977460\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hi HN! dyrector.io is an open-source container management platform with config & release management capabilities to your cloud, on-prem or hybrid infrastructure. You install the platform's agent to your infrastructure, add the registry you wanna deploy images from, and deploy them.\nWe made the platform to allow people who don't know anything about containers to set them up in dozens or hundreds of deployment targets. We thought it would be an interesting use case to engineers, too, who are uninterested or don't have the time to manage deployments and container maintenance in terminals.\nHope you find the platform useful and let us know if you have any feedback!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35960944\nPoints: 13\n# Comments: 1",

Design is incredibly subjective, but there's a sleek finesse to a lot of tech sites that really communicate a confidence and professionalism you don't see often otherwise.\nI'm talking about sites like Vercel, Stripe, Github (homepage), Gusto, Figma, Plaid, Podium, and so on.\nHow does one hire for that kind of thing. Does it really just boil down to finding designs you love and trying to poach? And how can one even know the personal contribution of a single designer when it could be diluted with a team?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35836732\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "I am looking for any insights or resources on best practices surrounding cli application design. There is a lot of variance out there in how tools use sub-commands, arguments, options, flags, etc. Some tools like git use nested sub-commands to distinguish between operations, while others like curl use options to accomplish the same purpose. Sometimes flags are mnemonic, but many times that's not possible because of the sheer number of flags. Some tools keep \"long option\" names short (\"--list\") while others may have multiple words (\"--list-software-updates\"). There's more but, I'll stop now to keep from rambling.\nI did a cursory search and found a few seemingly universal guidelines, though none of them spoke to how arguments and options should be used.\n* use stdout and stderr appropriately (i.e., don't write messages to the user to stdout)\n* use exit codes to indicate success / failure cases\n* ensure output is consistent and easily parsed by other cli tools\nWhat do you like? What do you hate? I would love to hear your thoughts on what style choices make for a more ergonomic cli tool.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35789781\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

I get it, you want new users, but your existing users need to log in too!\n2) auto play of video previews.\nNetflix, YouTube, Etc… they all do it. I don’t want the movie to start because I clicked to read the full description, or worse on the main screen just because I stop navigating for a second to read the blurb. I don’t want videos in my suggested feed on YouTube to play silently and then start 20 or 30 seconds into the video once I do click them. Does ANYBODY find these useful?  Why are they the default behaviors? Who do they benefit? Don’t they just end up costing unnecessary bandwidth?  I know that I can usually turn them off, but having to search for the setting is frustrating.\n…and don’t even get me started on form validators that are overly strict when they could just strip the unwanted delimiters or white space themselves, or password fields that cannot be pasted, or password rules that make it impossible to generate a random password.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35749631\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 6",

          "description": "Hey! Alexis and Tobi here. We built a native macOS client for ChatGPT API that is free to use (macOS Ventura).\nhttps://www.jamgpt.app/\nWe built and fine-tuned it to scratch our own specific text-processing itches, so we just wanted to share this with the community.\nIf you work with a lot of text or code like we do, check it out.\nIts core features include:\n- Instantly talk to ChatGPT from anywhere on your Mac by pressing a keyboard shortcut.\n- Avoid typing out repetitive prompts by saving prompts and accessing them quickly.\n- Just download and start typing as you would with ChatGPT. No need to learn anything new.\n- Comes with both dark and light mode options\nBatteries included: For the first 100 prompts, you can use our API key to try it out right away. After that, you can add your own OpenAI API key. The app is completely free to use and will remain so.\nWe may add additional pro features in the future, but we have no commercial intentions at the moment. Whatever you see now will remain free.\nThis is our first version, so things aren't perfect yet, and some features might be missing.\nGive it a spin and let’s talk! We’d love to hear your feedback.\nCheers! Tobi & Alexis\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35714731\nPoints: 7\n# Comments: 8",

I'm probably not the first to agree on this, and there are probably people who disagree.\nThis is how I would build a social media app as an example. But it works for a wide variety applications, from social to money to inventory tracking, and it's served me well each time.\n1. Make each table a logical collection of events that have occurred, not objects or state. This is not CRUD. One row means one event, for example a table `react` means \"a user reacted to some post.\" Keep these events as close as possible to the end user's intent.\n2. Never delete or update rows as a way to record events. This would mean forgetting that something happened. Only do that for manual corrections or spec…",

This is purely a thought experiment and design discussion on the feasibility of the idea that bothers me.\nI use Emacs most of the time. I do consider it a great piece of software purely due to its extensible nature. I can go on about how Emacs is fabulous, but that is not the point here.\nI use VSCODE too. And it is also a great text editor based on Electron.\nElectron is a great framework too.\nMost of us while doing software development, use a browser. Either for browsing documentation, finding answers, checking the meaning of the error messages, etc. We copy code from the editor, shell to the browser, and back to the editor, and shell.\nAlso using electron we can create almost any kind of desktop application. Currently what is happening is we create/ship the entire Chrome/JS run time to create an entirely new application for each specific case.\nNow let's try to put the pieces together.\nWhy can't there be a single editor that has a similar extensible nature as emacs but uses JavaScript as the scripting language, and develop extension using HTML and CSS unlike only a text-based extension using elisp in emacs, so that we can leverage the Chrome runtime efficiently?\nWhy can't we browse the web, edit text, and use the terminal all simultaneously?\nYes, anything is possible given that we solve the hurdles.\nBased on your expertise and experience what challenges do you consider one may face during the design and implementation of these requirements?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35683141\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 8",

          "description": "Im back on an intentional job search and unfortunately started going back on linkedin just to get a wider exposure to job postings. \nAm somewhat surprised by this but linkedin website on mobile (not the app) does not seem to have any way to log out from the account. I looked for a couple minutes and couldn’t find anything so it’s possible I missed it - but nothing is obvious.\nAdditionally, the expected place one would look for such a “feature” is the top right of the page - and that’s where the mobile site puts the link to messages. So it seems to be kind of an intentional loop into getting Users to view messages rather than leaving.\nAm somewhat dumbfounded by this but certainly seems like a dark pattern. Phuck you linkedin for this kind of stuff. I’ve always hated this platform and know others share similar feelings (and know there are advocates for it - fair enough).\nMy browser is set to not store cookies/cache anyway so after closing the mobile browser I was logged out. But good riddance.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35677411\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 7",

          "description": "This is an interface on top of the OpenAI API for GPT-3 and 4. It looks similar to ChatGPT, but has a few more features.\nIt does require you to have an API key for the GPT API. The API key is stored in your browser local storage , but a hash of it is used to make sure your history is unique to you. The hash is stored in the backend.\nThere are two main reasons why I created this for myself, you also might find it useful:\n- I would really wanted ChatGPT to have access get contents from websites\n- I don't like subscription fees and I don't like how slow the free ChatGPT is, I like to pay-as-I-go, and GPT API already allows me to do that\nP.S. There's also a Chrome extension for summarising pages, but it's my first time creating a Chrome extension. It's ugly and buggy, and the slow review process of the Chrome web app developer  console doesn't help.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35664563\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Do you ever feel like you're not making progress towards your life goals? Maybe you've set a goal to exercise more, read more books, or learn a new skill, but you struggle to stay motivated and on track. If this sounds familiar, habit tracking can be a powerful tool to help you achieve your goals.\nNotion is a versatile all-in-one workspace that can be customized to fit your specific needs. It's a great platform for tracking your habits and progress towards your life goals.\nHere's an example of a Notion system for tracking life goals and habits that allows you to track your life goals and habits on a daily basis, and provides a weekly summary to help you identify trends and areas for improvement. You can customize the template to fit your specific goals and habits, adding or removing items as necessary.\nHabit tracking in Notion has been a game-changer for me. It's helped me stay accountable, build momentum, and ultimately achieve my goals. By tracking my habits, I've been able to identify areas for improvement and adjust my strategies accordingly.\nIn addition to habit tracking, Notion also offers other features that can help you achieve your life goals. You can create a vision board to visualize your goals, track your progress towards them, and even break them down into smaller, more manageable tasks.\nIf you're looking for a way to achieve your life goals and build better habits, I highly recommend trying habit tracking in Notion. It's a powerful tool that can help you stay motivated and on track.\nLet me know if you have any questions or if you've found other helpful ways to track your life goals and habits!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35880510\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Saw this on a HN topic: https://justsimply.dev/ and it reminded me of a work habit I had, and how I changed it.\nIt talks about how we should avoid using words like “simply” and “it’s simple” when talking to users. This reminded me of how I had no idea how impactful this word could be for users. I’ll add the word “don’t worry” here as well when referring to their issues.\nI came to understand that they can come across as dismissive or condescending. Or, even worse, can make the person feel as though their problem is insignificant or that they are not intelligent enough to understand the solution.\nTo change this behaviour, I had a userscript that highlighted these words whenever I typed them, making me more aware of them and looking for ways to rewrite the sentence.\nCan you think of a work habit you had that you wanted to change, and what steps you took to change it?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35764181\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

For example, it has suggested that I create a schedule for myself that includes time for work, rest, and leisure activities, and to prioritize my tasks so that I'm focusing on the most important ones first.\nI created MonitUp because I was struggling with productivity and wanted a way to track my time and get recommendations on how to improve. It has been incredibly helpful for me, and I wanted to share it with the Hacker News community.\nI'm not here to advertise my product, but rather to share my experience and offer a recommendation for anyone who is looking for a tool to help them improve their productivity. If you're interested in trying MonitUp out, feel free to visit our website at https://timetracking.monitup.com/ and sign up for a free trial.\nI'm also here to ask for feedback from the community. What do you think about MonitUp? What other features would you like to see? How can I improve the tool to better serve our users?\nThank you for taking the time to read this, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.\nBest,\nFaruk Durak\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35679935\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hi HN! I created this lib in the need of a simple and tiny framework to easily do AJAX-style navigation / replacement of fragments in the page, in a web application.\nFor people who don't want to use client-side-rendering and complex frameworks à la React, there are nowadays a few \"HTML-over-the-wire\" libraries, like HTMX, Unpoly or this super-tiny one Swap.js :)\nOne other key thing is that no external tool is needed: no bundler, no webpack, no TypeScript compiler, no minification needed. Just write HTML, JS (+ your preferred server-side language: PHP, Python, etc.) and it works.\nThe framework makes use of fetch (of course) but also MutationObserver API to be able to launch actions when parts of the DOM change.\nLet me know what you think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35991783\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

Text is so small, and the light mode sucks (kind of like old reddit).\nIt's still kind of buggy, but (for me at least, I've seen lots of people complain about modern uis) it's more comfortable than regular HN, and maybe other people will find it useful.\nIK there's some mirrors of the website but they don't hit the same.

Without WASM, I would've either tried to port the docutils code or pre-compute the rendered HTML.\nIt's exciting to start to leverage these new tools, and I hope this small demo gives you inspiration when thinking about client-side libraries :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35904649\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Fir leverages Golang’s standard library html/template package and a bit of alpinejs to allow building reactive UIs. You start with plain old html and use alpinejs to enhance it to bring no-page-reload interactivity to web apps.\nThe Fir toolkit is designed for Go developers with moderate html/css & js skills who want to progressively build reactive web apps without mastering complex web frameworks. It includes a Go library and an Alpine.js plugin.\nHow it works ?\nOn receiving user-interactions the fir server re-renders html templates and sends it over the wire where the fir client library selectively updates the changed areas.\nWhen a user event is received by a Fir route, an array of html templates are rendered on the server and returned as an array of DOM events to the browser. The DOM events are consumed by the alpinejs plugin and dispatched within the DOM where listeners attached to elements can use the event to update the DOM.\nSee the demo and quickstart here: https://livefir.fly.dev/\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35881963\nPoints: 125\n# Comments: 39",

          "description": "Through the little Etsy store I've got, I offer Game Boy game repair mostly just so I get to \"play\" on different problems, and a different problem did arrive.\nThis Game Boy Advance game, although worked, requires a battery for the real time clock aspects of the game (i.e. timed events). The problem was that there was a repair attempt that had taken off the entire pad for the battery, and in fact had go through the pad, through the silk screen and had gone all the way into the fibre glass insulation layer (you might be able to see in the photo the woven pattern).\nBefore slapping a battery on and jumping the positive leg to the right component, I wanted to check that nothing else was missing. Thankfully the community have tried to preserve a lot of the history (in this case, the PCB traces) but also published it freely on the web.\nFrom this I also found a resistor had been lost in the previous repair. I don't think it's clear from my photo, but what I did was to bond the missing resistor in a completely different location (before it traces to a capacitor) and then use a jumper wire from the replaceable battery case. This was mostly in case the battery case was torn off again it wouldn't cause damage to the components on the board.\nOnce that was all done, the game happily had its clock and was returned to it's owner the same day.",
