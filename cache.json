Caring can range from “startup founder” level obsession to being completely checked out, and effectiveness will vary on that spectrum.\nCapacity - The amount of time and mental resources a team member can bring to a problem matters and will vary over time.  Illness, stress, a busy personal season or competing work priorities can reduce this temporarily for anyone.  Some people will have longer term lower capacity than others due to factors like life circumstances, health, and outside of work commitments.\nLeverage - People’s skills, experiences, tendencies, relationships a…",

Big meetings of more than 50 people will get shoehorned into a six-hour window on Thursdays, with a limit of one a week.\nThis is fascinating to me.  I get the desire to remove bloated meetings, but there are recurring meetings that I find genuinely valuable to have sync (project standups / staff meetings).

We have this card component that displays a health summary for the section of the app the user is currently inspecting (which could be a wind turbine, a system within that turbine, or the entire wind farm). Generally we want to show that towards the top left of the screen, with some other information on the right.

This post is for RSS subscribers only.\nRead more about RSS Club.\n\nAfter a good long hem n’ haw about Texas politics my friend Daniel filled a conversational pause by jokingly asking…\n“So what’s good?”\nA question made in jest, but it has stuck in me like a knife. I now see my ability to complain everywhere. On the walk to school with neighbors they ask how it’s going, “Ughck. I’m busy”, or “Ughck. It’s hot”, or “Ughck. Kids putting on shoes, amirite?!”\nI’m trying to figure this out. It’s starting to bother me because I don’t believe myself to be a negative or overly pessimistic person. But there are times I hear the vibe-killing “Debbie Downer” sludge pouring out of my mouth.\nThe best I can come up with is…\nI think it’s easier to complain? My negativity bias bubbling to the surface. Is it easier for humans to commiserate on bad circumstances rather than celebrate good ones?\nIt’s an attempt to self-deprecate? Life is going good but I don’t want you to think it’s going too good.\nMy engineering brain?

          "description": "Psst… I’ve been keeping a secret. As part of my Web Components course on Frontend Masters, I built an entire guidebook on how to get started with Web Components. A Web Components 101. I spent hundreds of hours preparing the materials for the course and I’m excited to announce that today I’m making the guidebook public for everyone to get started with Web Components.\nRead the Guidebook\nThis guidebook is different! Most Web Component resources drop you right into the JavaScript parts. Ughck. That’s fine, I guess, but seeing the markup for a <my-button> component doesn’t make my heart or brain sing. It also doesn’t help me understand one of Web Components’ biggest mental hurdles: The Shadow DOM. To overcome this, I’ve intentionally designed my course to build out layer-by-layer from HTML→CSS→JavaScript, like how old timers learned the web development in the past.\nStarting with <template> and <slot> –and most certainly with Web Component styling– you become familiar with the quirks of Shadow DOM first before writing your own from scratch. Following the navigation from left-to-right you’ll learn the ins-and-outs of Using → Styling → Writing the different flavors of Web Components. And because it’s part of the Web Platform, that knowledge will always be valuable.\nHTML-first may seem overly basic, but I find that lots of new and experienced developers alike have never even tried using a Web Component off the shelf. That’s my favorite part of Web Components! You can use lots of Web Components without a build process or any kind of Webpack sorcery. A script tag + HTML and you’re using them! Web Components make it easy to (dependably) use other people’s code.\nYou can of course still watch my Web Components course on Frontend Masters. I recommend it if you’re an visual or auditory learner like myself. There’s also a bit more back-and-forth with the live audience and their questions.",

          "description": "I watched the documentary General Magic (mentioned in Tony Fadell’s book Build) about the 1990s Apple spin-off company General Magic that built the iPhone before the iPhone. Ultimately the product was a commercial failure, but the documentary is a wonderful look at product design and what happens when you let talented engineers roam free range. They invented USB, created capacitive touch screen GUIs, and imagined the portable “Post-PC” world before Windows 95 and the Internet were ever popular. Ultimately the product was a failure, too early for its time. How did they build this product? Well the answer is… prototypes.\nMy favorite part of the documentary is Megan Smith beaming over her cabinet full of hardware prototypes. Her focus on making something people love, an intimate device, is infectious. Her eagerness to blend everyone’s wishes with the harsh reality of available and affordable hardware shows. Starting with off-the-shelf components and inventing if necessary. When describing the product, she’s not talking about megabytes, protocols, and pixels, but talking about the sound, the feeling, the touch of the product and software in people’s hands.\nI feel more vindicated than ever that prototypes, put in people’s hands, are the biggest opportunity to capture lightning in a bottle. These people are imagining and building the iPhone 17 years before the iPhone launched. Megan Smith talks like Steve Jobs, but Steve Jobs doesn’t work at Apple or General Magic. We often herald the invention of the iPhone or Android and these magic devices as invented out of thin air or our collective science fiction, but both of those products used by billions of people rose from the ashes of General Magic’s failure. That’s a lot to dwell on. The composting of failures produces rich and fertile soil.",

This early stable version will be released to a small percentage of users, with the majority of people getting the release a week later at the normal scheduled date, this will also be the date the new version is available from the Chrome download page.\nFor Chrome 110 the key dates will be:\nBeta: January 12, 2023\nEarly Stable: February 1, 2023\nStable: February 7, 2023\nYou can keep track of upcoming release dates and included features on the Chrome Status Roadmap, and on the Chromium Dashboard. The beta posts have more details of features, and any deprecations and removals for each release.\n# Why are we making this change?\nBy releasing stable to a small percentage of users early, we get a chance to monitor the release before it rolls out to all of our users. If any showstopping issue is discovered, it can be addressed while the impact is relatively small.\nFor most developers this change will have little impact. Keep following this blog for up to date information on features and any upcoming deprecations and removals. We aim to bring you any relevant information in good time for you to act upon it, before any change in Chrome.\nHero image by Simon Wilkes.",

          "description": "I'm normally someone who builds my core React components for a given project from scratch; it's not hard and I have maximum control if needs change (and don't have to go read a bunch of docs)\nBut right now I need to build a boring admin interface for somebody, with limited time to dedicate to it and it doesn't matter what the look and feel is or anything. So I'm considering pulling in a library like MUI so I can more quickly just bang out an interface and move forward\nQuestion is: does Material UI's convenience outweigh the extra complexity of adding a dependency, reading its docs, learning its conventions, etc? Especially for a relatively quick and simple thing\n(MUI-specific anecdotes only please; not interested in speculation or in discussions about the broader question of whether to add a dependency to a project)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34383168\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "What - I am working on a specification/language which can describe a traditional system design process for web-services.\nWhy - Having a language for system-design will improve design interviews and system documentation. It can also give rise to \"Competitive Designing\" industry same as \"Competetive Programming\" exists currently.\nHow - I am exploring existing specs (Docker-compose, OpenAPI and UML) and a way to merge them. They will define the system.\nFor the actual execution, I will use the spec to setup a sandbox environments and run blank instances of services in them. Then I would use custom defined API flows from the spec to simulate an actually running system.\nThis is not the hard part. The hard part is finding a way to benchmark these API flows which gives reliable scores for the effectiveness of the system for a given problem and API flows.\nHappy to discuss more.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34271635\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "As seen with things like open source software, many developer tools, Hacker News as a website and people's opinions on CSS and modern web design on places like Reddit?\nCause it feels like many people's tastes come from the 80s/early 90s, with the idea that any sort of visual flourish or attempt at readability is completely irrelevant.\nAnd it makes me wonder why this is. Why do so many... hacker type individuals seem to prefer very brutalist, utilitarian designs over anything more fancy? Where did this preference for plain text at the expense of all else come from anyway?\nBecause I don't think this happens quite as much in other fields, like architecture, cooking or construction.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34246340\nPoints: 35\n# Comments: 78",

In the beginning I thought something was messed up - only to realize what day it was today.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34124914\nPoints: 10\n# Comments: 5",

          "description": "As a software engineer, on my own I’ve been able to increase my efficiency and productivity at my current job over the years with the help of various programs such as command line interfaces (CLIs), GUI extensions (VS, VS Code, Chrome), software applications, and other shortcuts (aliases, etc.).  I know everyone has different preferences and work styles, but I can’t help but think what I’ve been able to apply would be useful for other developers at my company.\nUndoubtedly, there are other developers at my company have their own set of programs/workflows they use to increase their efficiency that I think could be useful to me and others.\nI'm curious to know what strategies other developers use or have used within their company to share productivity tips and programs with their colleagues. For example, is there a dedicated Teams/Slack channel, an internal wiki, or some other type of software where engineers can share/demo programs and shortcuts they use in their day-to-day work?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34330634\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I've been experimenting with a smart RSS reader and I've been using Superfeedr to ingest content.  Superfeedr monitors RSS feeds and calls a webhook when content arrives,  I stuff these into an Amazon SQS and then spool them out at my leisure.\nMy system requires a fairly high volume (1000's of articles) to train a machine learning model so I have been focusing on high volume feeds like preprints from the arXiv,  news from the Guardian, etc.\nNow Superfeedr charges 10¢ per feed per month,  my bill right now is $3 a month.  It's reasonable that I can subscribe to about 100 feeds on Superfeedr but subscribing to 1000 feeds seems pricey to me.\nThere are a lot of independent blogs out there that publish an article every week or every six months.  What they all have in common is that somebody has to poll an RSS file many many many times per article ingested.  W/ superfeedr it makes for high costs but it is a hassle even if I built my own RSS ingest system.\nOne thing that would help would be consolidated RSS feeds that aggregate posts from a large number of blogs.  Are there good ones out there?  Are there other answers to problem of polling hundreds or thousands of independent blogs?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34330134\nPoints: 11\n# Comments: 9",

          "description": "I wrote an RSS reader called RSS Brain recently. The motivate is the current RSS readers either don't sort articles by priority, which makes it hard to read posts from HackerNews and Reddit, or sort it with some \"smart\" algorithm which I don't trust. I also like the Google News feature that can show related story from different source, but the sources are not configurable and the algorithm is not transparent either. So with RSS Brain, I implemented these features:\n* Recommend related articles from the feeds of your choice. It's backed by ElasticSearch and the algorithm is described on RSS Brain's website.\n* Option to sort articles by upvotes and time. The algorithm is similar to the old Reddit and you can find it on the website as well.\n* Save search terms into folders so you can filter the articles.\nI've been using it for a while and found these features very helpful. So I want to share this on HackerNews. The frontend is written in Flutter so it has cross platform clients, even though the web version don't feel very \"web native\" because the level of Flutter web support. I guess only time can improve that.\nI don't have enough hardware to scale it up so it's currently in subscription mode to limit the users. I'm going to open source the code (maybe non-commercial license) once I think it's ready so you can host it by yourself. It's still in early stage and haven't been tested by a lot of people. So any feedback is helpful. Thanks!\nUpdate: Added a scroll down hint in the landing page.

          "description": "MailChimp used to send out a client's newsletters from RSS feed without issue. A few weeks ago, they started showing up a day later. After weeks of trying to get support to track down this bug, we finally got this response\n\"Thank you for your patience while my team looks at this. We were able to confirm that the best time range currently to space the blog posts is 10-12 hours before Mailchimp's sending time. There just isn't enough time between your posts and the feed to pull the new content.\nAs a best practice, I would plan your content releases a day in advance with this functionality in mind.\"\nIt started with 4 hours, now they are telling us 10-12 hours in advance? My client runs a news site and sends our daily news. It's not always possible to even publish content that far in advance. It's insane to me that this functionality was working fine, for years. That they have managed to break and instead of fixing are saying just publish an insane amount of time ahead of the newsletter being sent?\nI'm not sure what it takes to get someone's attention at MailChimp to actually fix this. Read the RSS feed before sending the scheduled post. Like it used to. Otherwise, what newsletter providers would people recommend replacing MailChimp with?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34102591\nPoints: 7\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "Hey HN, my name is Mokshit and I'm really interested in web-performance and web-development. At the time of writing this, I'm a junior in high school.\nMacaron is a typesafe CSS-in-JS library with zero runtime, colocation, maximum safety and productivity.\nThe motivation behind it is that runtime CSS-in-JS libraries, that is most of the CSS-in-JS libs, add alot of bloat to web apps and have a considerable performance drop with a bundle size increase. Alot of them also don't support more performant ways of building web apps like streaming markup. Most of the current compile-time CSS-in-JS libraries try to fix this, but have some or the other drawback like not offering colocation, or not being type-safe.\nToday, Macaron does all this with a compiler that extracts all the style declarations at compile-time and converts them to static css files while also letting you author the type-safe styles in the same file as your application code. It supports both - a vanilla styling API and a styled-component API with support for multiple frameworks like SolidJS and React and build tools like Vite and Esbuild. Macaron is currently missing a webpack plugin, but that will also be published soon, making it compatible with almost all bundlers.\nThere's a ton of room for improvement in this space, and I feel like macaron is a step in that direction.\nGithub - https://github.com/macaron-css/macaron\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34368626\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "At one point during the construction of my house, we needed designs for the kitchen and bathroom cabinets and a bedroom wardrobe.\nI wanted full control of the design process. Doing it in vector illustration software was too painful and it was taking too long. But I didn't have the time to learn any complex CAD tool either.\nSo I developed a small HTML/JS/CSS tool for designing MDF furniture by writing my own little language that transpiles into a CSS grid layout.\nTake a look at the blog post for details:\nhttps://alnvdl.github.io/2023/01/07/designing-furniture-usin...\nOr go directly to the tool (works best on desktop or tablet): https://alnvdl.github.io/squareplanner/\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34290524\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",
