          "description": "In 2010 I discovered input masks.\nThey seemed like a smart way to prevent errors. Because they help users follow a format. And they do so without taking up space.\nBut the truth is that this fancy pattern degrades UX.\nHere‚Äôs why:\nProblem #1: They‚Äôre confusing\nFor example, the cursor advances automatically to the next position. And placeholder characters can‚Äôt be deleted.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tTelephone input mask replacing characters and advancing to the next position automatically\n\t\n\nProblem #2: They may be mistaken for an actual answer\nThis is because the mask looks like an input causing using to submit the form with errors.\nInput masks make the input look like it‚Äôs been answered\n\t\n\nProblem #3: They make the interface feel broken\nThis is because typing a restricted character gets ignored.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRestricted characters get ignored without giving users any feedback\n\t\n\nProblem #4: The format may be unfamiliar\nFor example, a phone number may require a country code which isn‚Äôt always expected and makes users work harder.\nInput masks may use unfamiliar formats that don‚Äôt make sense to everyone\n\t\n\nProblem #5: They‚Äôre misleading and verbose in screen readers\nFor example, they announce placeholder characters which aren‚Äôt part of the answer. And they don‚Äôt announce characters that were typed but ignored.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tVoiceover announces placeholder characters. And fails to announce characters that were typed but ignored.\n\t\n\nWhat to do instead\nLeave the input empty to make it obvious where the answer goes\nLet users type what they like so the interface doesn‚Äôt feel unresponsive and broken\nAllow multiple formats so users don‚Äôt have to fix something unnecessarily\nAllow users to check their answers either on a separate page or just below the field",

          "description": "I‚Äôve previously written about the problems with regular sticky menus.\nIn response to those issues, some people suggest showing and hiding the menu as the user scrolls up and down.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tBondir‚Äôs sticky menu appears and disappears as the user scrolls\n\t\n\nThis seems smart because:\nthe menu gets out of the way to allow users to focus on the content\nit allows users to access the menu without having to scroll back to the top\nBut this approach is worse than regular sticky menus.\nHere‚Äôs why:\nProblem #1: They‚Äôre distracting\nThis is because as the user scrolls the content to fit in the viewport, the menu will suddenly appear.\nGood design doesn‚Äôt guess (wrongly) about what users need.\nProblem #2: They‚Äôre hard to control\nThis is because scrolling up too much reveals the menu when it‚Äôs not wanted. And scrolling down a bit by accident will hide it when it is wanted.\nGood design doesn‚Äôt take control away.\nProblem #3: They cause dizziness and nausea\nThis is because animation can cause dizziness, nausea, headaches and more.\nGood design avoids physical stress.\nProblem #4: They can impact performance\nThis is because JavaScript is needed to react to the scroll event which can drain the battery and degrade performance especially on low-powered devices.\nGood design is lightweight.\nWhat to do instead\nKeep pages short: Sticky menus are a symptom of long pages so fix the root cause.\nJust let users scroll: It‚Äôs a myth that scrolling is a problem. Even on mobile, the top of the page is a flick or 2 away mostly.\nPut relevant links in context: For example, add a subscribe form to the end of a post or add a CTA to a pricing section.\nUse a back-to-top link: They‚Äôre relatively unobtrusive (but only do this once you exhaust the other options).",

This can be a great way to keep users engaged and make your website more visually appealing.\n          \nIn the past, the only way to create scroll-driven animations was to respond to the scroll event on the main thread. This caused two major problems:\nScrolling is performed on a separate process and therefore delivers scroll events asynchronously.\nMain thread animations are subject to jank.\nThis makes creating performant scroll-driven animations that are in-sync with scrolling impossible or very difficult.\nWe are now introducing a new set of APIs to support scroll-driven animations, which you can‚Ä¶",

A PC board is an inexpensive way to connect all the wires at once. When Steve Jobs and I started, with a blue box and then the Apple I and Apple II computers, I did the digital design, connecting hundreds of wires myself on the prototypes. Steve Jobs took the role of getting PC boards made so that we could manufacture sellable products.\nAfter a short while we had outside companies create the PC boards according to my designs. I was extremely proud of one design that far exceeded what had been done before.

The Achilles heel of open source projects...\nSample size is low, but everyone whom I ask outside of my tech circle says that they prefer Twitter's UI because Mastodon looks kinda clunky or just ugly. And seems like some Mastodon users also agree[1]. As such, I wanted to see what the sentiment on HN is, that is, do you like Mastodon's UI?\n[1]: https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/19571\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36598199\nPoints: 6\n# Comments: 4",

          "description": "This is something I've been working on for a while. I've previously shared a video showing the designing and code exporting process of my web/mobile design tool[0]. I still felt at that point that there was a huge disconnect between development and design. I think I've solved that with these special components that allow:\n- developers to build their logic using zero effort, placeholder UI\n- designers to redesign these UI's while testing their work in its final form, in the full context of the application\n- developers to accept these ready-to-go designs in a way that doesn't clutter the codebase\nI oscillate between feeling ecstatic, because I feel like I'm on the edge of finally solving the back and forth handoff problem I've often dealt with, and some light despair, because I have a very small network (no decision makers) and would struggle to get something even perfect off the ground. I'm only saying this so someone reading is encouraged to either A) let me know that this is something they want or B) bring me back to reality, and explain why I'm wasting my time.\nCheers!\n[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36291173\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36491835\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Hey folks,\nI'm super excited to announce the release of a new UI for Apache Kafka, Confluent, Redpanda and Kinesis that focuses on Teams and Data Mesh. (Note: the desktop version is also very popular with individual developers!)\nWhy is this important? Because providing a solution that can be used by both IT and business (non-technical) users is essential when building applications that process business data.\nOf course, we are mainly developers working on Kadeck. So you won't miss any of the features you need to troubleshoot and monitor Kafka and your applications. In fact, we have put a lot of effort into making Kadeck the best UI for Apache Kafka on the market. This includes enterprise features such as fine-grained rights management, topic organisation with data owners, labels and topic (API) documentation, teams and roles as well as LDAP/AD connectivity, data policies and masking, audit log and much more.\nI hope you enjoy using Kadeck - either the free version or the Professional/Enterprise version - and please let me know your feedback. I always love to hear about your specific use case!\nHave a great day,\nBen\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36486868\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I don't even know where to start with this, but the UI/UX of Amazon Music is so incomprehensibly bad it's hard to believe it wasn't put together by first year interns. We're led to believe that FAANG hires the best of the best minds but it's increasingly obvious this can't be the case anymore. A short list of my experiences:\n* Infinite scroll is broken in the desktop browser. I can't access songs in my library beyond the letter A. Why infinite scroll is needed here or anywhere for that matter is an entire discussion unto itself.\n* Random music I've purchased is unavailable for streaming and has been reassigned to \"shuffle with other songs\" as I don't subscribe to unlimited. I can still download the songs and listen to them locally however. To put it another way, some stuff I've purchased looks like I haven't, perhaps in an attempt to get me to repurchase it.\n* Accessing a 30 second sample of a song is hidden behind a mess of dark patterns. Scrolling in this UI is broken as well with overlapping layers hiding text and graphics. In fact the whole purchasing of music has been deliberately obfuscated likely to encourage streaming.\n* Searching for music within your own library is nearly impossible.\nI could go on and on about this but my experiences have been so bad I'm left speechless as to how this made it to production. As a highly experienced technical user I can't help but feel how the average consumer forced to interact with this garbage feels.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36372298\nPoints: 6\n# Comments: 2",

But now with Reddit going dark and people looking for a new place to migrate to, I'm doing a quick launch today.\nA few quick things:\n1. I don't believe federated platforms will ever become mainstream. They have a whole host of problems, not the least of which is that they're too complicated for most people to use. This platform is not, therefore, federated.\n2. I don't know what the best way of monetizing a thing like this is. I see only two options: the Wikipedia model of running on donations, or being advertising supported (along with a paid ad-free tier). The Wikipedia model works quite well for small-scale and bandwidth li‚Ä¶",

          "description": "Hey hacker news\nI'm the founder and lead developer at Opine.cm, and we've just rolled out a new feature that hopefully will reduce the number iterations in your design or web-dev projects.\nI've always been a big fan of checklists. When checklists were introduced to hospitals prior to surgeries, the number of complications and deaths dropped by 35%. I use them a lot personally - but I know many designers and devs find it too much effort.\nThe reality is, we easily forget verbal feedback; the humble to-do list solves this. We've just taken the added step of using AI to turn any video feedback that you get into a to-do list.\nTo try it for yourself\n- Create an account at https://Opine.cm\n- Record some feedback on the design examples\n- Watch as the AI creates your to-do list.\nOr here's a demo\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/e7a6ccd0df0b4dfb8552bd08c7c8ab56\n(Quick note - The demo shows design work - but you can add also add websites in Opine.)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36353445\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hi everyone,\nI'm Joachim, and together with my co-founder, we're building Visoid - a tool for rendering architectural designs in an iterative manner.  We firmly believe that the future of this type of rendering, especially during the ideation stage of a project, will be heavily reliant on generative AI.\nTraditionally, you would send your designs to a professional and potentially wait several days for the renders to be ready, all the while going back and forth with consultations. With Visoid, you can now receive instant, beautiful renders at a fraction of the cost.\nOur platform is designed for architects and rendering professionals who work with visualizations of architectural designs. Visoid enables our users to iteratively modify the scene, materials, and elements in a sketch, 3D model or similar, controlled with a simple prompt.\nWe're still in the early stages, and while the output isn't always perfect, we've made significant strides in improving the quality and the control of the output images. We're confident that it's only a matter of time before we can consistently deliver higher quality images and with even more control.\nWe're still figuring out how to fit this product into the workflow of our users and would love to get your feedback. I will try to answer any questions you have.\nFor more example images, have a look at our Instagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/visoidai/\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36341692\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Am I the only one using Thunderbird strictly as an RSS client? I've seen countless RSS clients recommended here over the years but none ever have the features to make me switch, mainly due to lacking extension support (for things like uBlock Origin and Bypass Paywalls) or privacy concerns from not running on a local Linux desktop. (I haven't heavily used the e-mail functionality in Thunderbird in over two decades. I haven't tried the Chat or any other functionality at all.)\nIs there something I'm missing out on? Is there a client with all the same features and then some that I just haven't found yet? I've looked at Feedly, Inoreader, and many others through the years but none have risen to the level of replacement. It's not broken so I'm not looking to fix it but I'm open to hearing how others manage their feeds to see if there's any possible improvements I've overlooked.\nFull disclosure: I've donated in the past to Thunderbird/Mozilla, including company matches.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36691782\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 2",

High DPI, high resolution. Not excessively blurry, or retina-like. Good color representation.\n- Single monitor setup.\n- Be able to see 3 screens side by side comfortably, with my coding screen at minimum 16px font size\n- Around 1-1.5k.\n- Can be driven by a Macbook Pro\nI am currently comparing a Dell 43\" 4K Ultrasharp screen (dell u4323qe)  vs a LG 40\" Ultrawide 5kx2k (lg 40wp95c-w). I don't have any experience using an ultrawide vs a very large screen so feedback around that decision (or recommendations of other monitors) would be very useful.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36682537\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 16",

          "description": "Has anyone here tried using an oxygen concentrator to increase their productivity?  I can get the CO2 level in my room to around 580 with a comfortable temperature, but I never feel quite as clear-headed as when I'm working outside.  I'm wondering if getting an oxygen concentrator that gets my effective CO2 level to ~400 would carry any risks or downsides that I should know about. For example, one thing I'm learning is that these machines can be loud, so I'd need to consider whether the productivity gain from increased oxygen would be offset by increased ambient noise.\nUpdate: Here are a list of things I think I'll try based on comments: 1. oxygen cylinder, 2. CO2 scrubber, 3. oxygen concentrator, 4. air exchanger.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36559258\nPoints: 24\n# Comments: 60",

          "description": "I'm curious what methods people here use to avoid distractions when working on a computer. Obviously computers are excellent tools, but simply having access to an internet browser can be a gateway to a massive time sink.\nSome things I have tried:\n- Set up a Pi-Hole with distracting websites on the blacklist so the DNS requests do not resolve. I disabled this to dork around on the web today, so clearly not an effective commitment device.\n- \"Cold Turkey Writer\" which locks down your PC giving only a text box essentially, until you write X words. I didn't find this useful for my writing style since I tend to look up additional references/sources as I write, and losing access to that hurt my flow.\n- Using a Raspberry Pi 4B as my desktop PC, with the idea being I couldn't play games and YouTube isn't entertaining when 30% of the frames are dropping. I ended up wasting a bunch of time messing with Linux trying to get stuff to work (oh Obsidian needs to be compiled and installed for ARM, oh there's no Google Drive installer for Linux, let's set up rclone, oh the audio driver broke). It was cool to have a fanless, low-power PC but I went back to my Windows desktop out of frustration and desire to have things \"just work\".\nIs it futile to use hardware/software to try and fix a self-discipline issue? What works for you?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36346043\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "For the longest time I hated how I could not easily make HTML tables that are showing nice excel like data (i.e. they are really correctly using table, tr, and td tags for data not layout) to look good on mobile.\nI finally have a solution I love. I keep using it over and over.\nheaders := []string{\"name\", \"age\", \"species\", \"home_planet\", \"language\", \"occupation\"}\nI define the headers and call:\nc.MakeCells(list, headers, \"_welcome\")\nThe list is an array of key values pairs, and _welcome is just the name of the view.\n{{ define \"_welcome_col1\" }}\n{{ $row := index . \"row\" }}\n{{ index $row \"name\" }}\n{{ end }}\n{{ define \"_welcome_col2\" }}\n{{ $row := index . \"row\" }}\n{{ index $row \"age\" }}\n{{ end }}\netc.\nThen with tailwindcss I have:\n\n    {{ template \"_table_large\" . }}\n\n\n    {{ template \"_table_small\" . }}\n\nSo I'm rendering both the tables on the page but only 1 will show depending on the size of the screen.\nAnd the logic in _table_small is the secret to the whole thing. Instead of displaying each row horizontally, it repeats the headers vertically as col1 and then col2 is each row value.\nYou can see demo at https://many.pw/\nJust make the window smaller if you are on desktop and it will jump to the small version.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36593583\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 3",

I have recently searched for a tool like that, but haven‚Äôt found any. So, I decided to create Bordiple.\nBordiple is a CSS Multiple Borders generator tool. It allows coders and no-coders to create beautiful borders and share the result with any person using a custom link.\nEvery feedback will be very welcome.

The problem was that there was a repair attempt that had taken off the entire pad for the battery, and in fact had go through the pad, through the silk screen and had gone all the way into the fibre glass insulation layer (you might be able to see in the photo the woven pattern).\nBefore slapping a battery on and jumping the positive leg to the right component, I wanted to check that nothing else was missing. Thankfully the community have tried to preserve a lot of the history (in this case, the PCB traces) but also published it freely on the web.\nFrom this I also found a resistor had been lost in the previous repair. I don't think it's clear from my photo, but what I did was to bond the missing resistor in a completely different location (before it traces to a capacitor) and then use a jumper wire from the replaceable battery case. This was mostly in case the battery case was torn off again it wouldn't cause damage to the components on the board.\nOnce that was all done, the game happily had its clock and was returned to it's owner the same day.",
