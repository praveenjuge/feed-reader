When used selectively and sparingly it can be a great way to help resources that the browser won’t discover in the HTML itself—a background image referenced in CSS, a JavaScript file injected by a script loader, etc—arrive much earlier.\nUnfortunately, like anything, it can also be misused and the consequen…",

I never felt attracted to these tools even though thousands of developers had success with them. I’m not sure why I never jumped in, but I’m sure verbosity and/or tooling fatigue played a part. Ultimately, I ended up settling on my own SMACSS/BEM hybrid that’s more of a .block--variant .generic {}  pattern with some global utilities mixed in.\nI’m not anti-BEM nor anti-roboclasses, but as we enter a new era for CSS I think we have an opportunity to rethink best practices aro…",

          "description": "I’m not dying, but before I do I want to share with you — future generations of rockers — what I know about putting on a live music rock show.\nThe audience’s energy will match your energy. If you stand like a turd on the stage, they audience will stand like a bunch of turds. If you bob your head, they’ll bob their heads. If you move around, they’ll move around. If you show low confidence, they’ll have low confidence in you and start checking out.\nDon’t let your band drama show on stage. Every band has drama, but don’t let it show on stage. The audience isn’t there for that.\nPractice setting up and tearing down efficiently. Don’t make the audience wait and don’t be “that guy” who drags out setup extra long as some weirdo passive-aggressive attention seeking move. See previous rule.\nNo matter how big the stage, setup as close to each other as possible. Look and feel like a combined unit of people making music. Trust me, it will be more impressive.\nThe bassist and the drummer should stand next to each other. It’s all about the bass guitar and the kick drum locking in together.\nNever leave the van unattended during load-in or load-out. If you haven’t had your gear stolen at this point, it’s a miracle.\nLead guitar gets the attention, but the bass guitar brings the sex. Flashy medleys get attention, but people feel the bass, no matter how boring.\nDon’t riff stage banter. It’s hard to be witty on the fly unless you are very, very witty. Have some prepared goofs or smalltalk.\nMake friends with the soundboard operator. This person ultimately controls how good you sound and can make or break you.\n“Come forward to the stage” is at best a one-time suggestion. You can’t control people, never ask more than once.",

They can go sideways. In most cases they go downwards. But never upwards. For years, we've fantasized about a \"Parent selector\". And now it's finally coming! In the shape of a :has() pseudo selector.\nThe :has() CSS pseudo-class represents an element if any of the selectors passed as parameters match at least one element.\nBut, it's more than a \"parent\" selector.

The following text provides context, but if you already understand what I am after, you can skip it.\n----------------------------\nIn 1992, when we saw Visio for the first time, we  hoped that one day we would be able to use it for creating software design documents visually, and then deploying them with the press of a button. Visio is a general-purpose diagram-drawing application, so it cannot do that, but it has always supported linking and embedding, so in theory it could be used for this purpose by a specialized software design tool. However, I have never head of any such tool.\nIn 1993 Microsoft a…",

          "description": "Hey HN, 10 years after the project began we have updated the UI for the cloud server comparison site known as EC2Instances.info. This refresh brings a sticky filter bar so you can scroll and see what filters are applied, a more compact navbar, and improved UX for comparing instances.\nI've also fixed numerous long standing UI bugs including: comparisons now load correctly on RDS and ElastiCache, sort by max ENI works, sort by RDS instance storage works, and all dropdowns have consistent behavior.\nFor maintainers and contributors, all the frontend libraries are upgraded to their latest versions, https://github.com/vantage-sh/ec2instances.info. Going forward, we are aware that the homepage size is quite large and have plans to address this.\nWe have tried to be good stewards of this project and evolve it carefully.

          "description": "Hey there..\nI have started writing a book on software design/architecture that provides a different perspective than existing books out there. The thesis of the book is that \"code is for humans\". The book explains how to write code that is optimal for our primitive monkey brains. The book describes how many of the best practices in software stem from deficiencies in our cognitive abilities. It expands on best practices such as (DRY, SSOT, etc) and brings new ideas on what is good code and how to write it.\nI am looking for someone to partner with on this book as it's a huge project and I would love to be able to split the work.\nI have written a rough outline and filled in about 40 pages of notes, examples and text. The project is still very much in it's infancy.\nA bit about me: I worked as the software architect of a 100+ person team at Mobileye/Intel and have many, many years of experience working on a variety of software from self driving cars to web apps.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32562332\nPoints: 26\n# Comments: 18",

The only accepted/understood direct reply to one of these forwards is \"block\", which will forever block Foo from sending to Bar.

          "description": "By seriously I mean both the theory and the practical. The theory of how to actually design and analyse algorithms. And also implement them in a language. The language shouldn't matter while thinking about algorithms.\nAt the moment I am not opting for something like leetcode. I want something that teach me the principles of how to actually design from the fundamentals.\nAlso I want to be as much language agnostic as possible. By that I mean the ability to think about algorithmic solutions to problems in terms of mental models that I can then translate to a low level language like C, or a dynamic imperative language like Python, or a functional language like Racket, SML or OCaml. Of course, the assumption here is that I must know the language I want to implement the algorithm in. So basically I want to learn about algorithms in a paradigm agnostic way so that I can implement them in any paradigm I want.\nHow to go about this? Do you have any book or course suggestions in mind?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32540102\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 3",

I don't consider myself a person that good at writing stories (or anything other than programming) and often find my games bland and boring pretty fast.\nSo, what I'm asking now is some advice.

          "description": "I'm at the point where I am starting to write shaders to do custom effects in WebGL,  such as combining a left and a right image to make an anaglyph image.\nWhat I'm thinking about next is about how to make \"game like\" UIs on the web for desktop and mobile.  Some things that I am inspired by are:\n(1) The Playstation 3 interface https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XrossMediaBar\n(2) Interfaces in video games for viewing a database or documentation about the game world.  I'd like to make something similar but for some part of the real world.\nThe Pokédex from Pokémon is a familiar example but it's not such a good one because Pokémon games mostly run on low-spec handhelds,  so I am thinking more about what you'd see on a PC or TV console games...  But instead of using a game controller you'd be using the touchscreen,  mouse or keyboard.\n(3) However I very much like how games for the Nintendo DS/3DS use the touchscreen such as peeling stickers in Paper Mario Sticker Star and how you can make Luigi fight in the boss battles in Mario and Luigi Dream Team.  So some advanced capability for touch gestures is wanted.\nI'd prefer programming in Javascript,  could accept Typescript but it would be a hard sell if it (say) compiled something else to WebAssembly unless that came with awesome capabilities.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32442496\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Howdy HN! Been working on a side project of mine for about a year called Gloutir. It's essentially an 'agency of one' design and development service using a subscription or retainer model for billing (Stripe + Memberstack).\nI primarily focus on WordPress and Webflow design and development as I realized long ago that there's a huge demand for these services  in the design / marketing agency space.\nI've had a lot of success the past year with this work, and surprisingly (or unsurprisingly) every single client of mine has been a larger agency needing additional help. That kind of makes sense because an agency can immediately see the value in what I offer without really having to be convinced.\nRecently I've introduced a weekly option for clients looking to launch fast and spend less ($1,000 a week, maybe not sustainable but we’ll see). I'd love to get more involved with startups needing landing page work / design services.\nThere are a number of people doing stuff like this, but I do want to clarify that this is never going to be an \"unlimited design\" style subscription service. I've intentionally set a hard cap on the number of clients because it's simply impossible to accommodate more than a certain number of clients while keeping the quality of work where it needs to be.\nAnywho, curious what you all think and if you have any suggestions on how to improve.\nhttps://gloutir.com/\nAbout me: full time designer and developer at an agency. Can see more of my work at https://zchry.org.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32440171\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "Hi! Genie Builder is a free VSCode plugin that makes it easy to build web GUIs for Julia applications (and in future, Python apps too). Users can simply drag & drop UI elements to create interactive dashboards and data apps, without writing any frontend code.\nThe tool is designed for data scientists and researchers who need to expose their data models to business users with an interactive web application, but lack the software development skills to build one.\nGenie Builder completely eliminates the need to learn frontend development to code the UI. And very soon, we’re also going to support one-click cloud deployments to make it easy to build AND deploy data apps - no frontend nor devops skills required.\nI’m Adrian, the creator of the open-source Genie web framework (https://genieframework.com/). Genie offers low-code libraries for building data applications - just like Streamlit or Dash, but for JuliaLang. We developed Genie Builder because of feedback from our open source community who needs more productive data tooling.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32355012\nPoints: 30\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "So, recently i started giving out interviews. I have 7+ years of experience so one or two design rounds are expected. \nKeeping that in mind i revised my concepts on distributed system and read few famous papers on distributed system. it was fun visiting those concepts again.\nAlso, as advised i watched few scaling videos on youtube (i.e Design Uber etc.)\nI have experience building system from scratch and depending upon the requirement i have scaled few services in my organization.\nSo, my expectations from the design round was to have open-ended discussion with interviewer on certain component and discussing drill-down component architecture, scaling issues, drawbacks etc.\nBut For me at least, reality is quite different. I was asked to design BookMyShow ( Movie booking system ) in full. I mean the interviewers expectation was to just draw the components, write the api and design schema. He will understand my work by looking into it.\nI have given 5+ interviews as of now ( got offer from some of them). But i feel like design round wasn't justified.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32353046\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

When you want to discuss tradeoffs of those options who do you talk that over with?\nI am one of two technical cofounders for a small software company. We have really good discussions about the design of our product. I am pretty good at searching. We are comfortable weighing alternatives and making a decision and living with the consequences. All that said, sometimes I want to discuss with other people some of the design challenges we face, or seek input on how people have approached the problem.\nAre there fora that you enjoy for such discussion? It seems that it does not fit with the theme of most Q&A sites. Most IRC channels I know of are pretty focused on their own specific topic.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32331825\nPoints: 148\n# Comments: 101",

All I find is courses that are either too low level with technicalities or top high levels.\nYeah I know there is the data intensive applications I read it and it's not dealing with these specific design decisions its more of 40 k feel look.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32287084\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "TapeMeasure is a utility class, written in Swift, for generating a visual tape measure, or any other graphical elements that need layout in a measured sequence.\nI created this class to help with a pet project I'm working on, where I needed to generate segmented, labeled lines to use as axes on charts and graphs. It occurred to me that this seems to be a pretty common task, involving a lot of boilerplate code and tedious calculations. Why not decouple the code and move it into a dedicated class? It's self-contained, nice and simple, and easy to unit test.\nIt can also handle a lot of tweaks to the \"tape measure\", such as boundary clipping and shifting offsets. It's especially good for animation, where you can just change a parameter or two during animation, and call for the re-calculated data to re-render your measured line. That makes it great for animated sliding and scaling effects.\nAnyway, enjoy!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32279795\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "So here we go, our rebranding is done. New logo, new domain, what could go wrong.\nWe provide a tool to convert design files between Figma, XD, Sketch, Figma, PDF and more and have recently rebranded it from \"XD2Sketch\" to \"Magicul\". We started out as a simple tool to allow users to import XD files in Sketch hence the name XD2Sketch but soon added more features. The name just didn't make sense anymore. Magicul initially seemed to be a great name, but turned out to be a bit of an interesting pick when translated to French.\nWe've sent out a newsletter to our customers to let them know about the changes and here's what one of our users replied:\nHey folks,\nWhile I understand that you guys probably hope to operate primarily in English, I think it needs to be mentioned that your brand name \"Magicul\" in french, literally means \"Magical ass\"... but the real kicker is the .io of the domain, which literally means input & output...\nSo here goes the bad news... The entire french community is reading your brand name - literally - as: Magical ass (dot) in & out.\nAnd then there's the logo itself... which is a hole with a hat.\nChrist. You can't make this stuff up. This is ugh, umm, a brutally unfortunate brand?...lol\nI'm in Quebec, Canada, where french is dominant and so I'm keenly aware of this - and so are my partners, colleagues and friends. We all had a good laugh.\nDon't know what else to say...?\nBonne chance mes amis!\nHave a good one,\n- A fan of your work in Montreal.\nYou can checkout our website here: https://magicul.io\nI just thought this was too hilarious to not share.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32276120\nPoints: 134\n# Comments: 81",

          "description": "Hello HN !\nI'm the founder of https://symfoz.com which is basically a RSS aggregator that allows people to partition the content they want to see in dedicated spaces called \"Playlists\", thus reducing the time needed to find the information they need.\nWhy Symfoz instead of other RSS aggregators ?\n- Create playlists of content, avoid mixing too many feeds in the same place. You know where everything is.\n- Follow people or playlists, people can create some playlists with AWESOME content, you may benefit from it.\n- We handle classic RSS feeds, but also Youtube channels, Twitter feeds, Spotify Podcasts, sub-reddits.\n- An easy UI interface (This is still WIP, UI is very hard haha)\n- Promote retention of information by allowing people to take notes (not highlighting but really take notes), instead of just consuming content and forget it. You'll be able to find your notes easily.\nA bit more about the project (you can skip this!), this is a side project that I've been working on for almost a year.\nI'm a back-end developer and the stack runs in Python. If you'd like more details, please feel free to ask, I'll be glad to answer !\nThanks for taking the time to read this, feel free to give any feedback, I would be really grateful :) !\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32622866\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

We’re excited to share what we’ve been working on, the Lumina Desk (https://getlumina.com/desk).\nLast January, we founded Lumina with the mission of building the next-generation workspace.\nWe started off by launching a product called the Lumina Webcam, essentially a modern webcam that uses software to make you look good.\nBuilding hardware is hard, and it’s been no different for us. We ran an Indiegogo campaign in September that raised ~$700k, scrambled to figure out hardware production (encountering every obstacle you can imagine - customs, supplier issues, parts incompatibilities), and chewed through enough glass in order to start shipping in December.

          "description": "Over the past few years several open source decentralized platforms have emerged. Most modeled after existing sites and social networks, others being new concepts entirely. In this writing, I have taken concepts from rank oriented forums like Reddit and Hacker News, but incorporated them with RSS to make something free of biased algorithms. I believe this could give users not just a personal reader for themselves, but one that allows users to connect through comments and relational feeds. Ones that display feeds by what all users of an instance follow and feeds among multiple instances of this platform design.\nHow the main feed ranking works\nEvery user has their own personal subscription list of RSS feeds. Obviously by default they can view their own feeds like any old traditional reader. …",

          "description": "Productivity timers needed to be triggered manually before each task, Making it a chore by itself, Often leading to us not using them after a while and They don't take health into consideration.\nHealth timers are intrusive, Even then they are not always accurate and They don't take productivity into consideration.\nButt Mover addresses those problems by using a butt trigger for automatically starting the productivity timer when we sit on the chair before our workstation and a break timer which reminds us to take a walk automatically when we get up.\nButt Mover also incentivizes its usage through a Game. When the health(tasks/breaks) reaches zero its game over.\nI've been iterating different forms of Butt Mover over past two years and released the web application earlier this year(After feedback from several HN users). Today I'm making the core application open-source as I've committed myself to make the Health & Education applications I build open-source.\nI hope you'd use Butt Mover for yourself and build Butt Trigger for others to improve productivity and health. Feedback and contributions to improve the project is appreciated.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32346878\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "It seems obvious to me that something like RSS would make a great events publication format, and I'm wondering if anyone has already thought of this.\nSay I would like to follow the events of my local art gallery and the local gigs of a certain musician. The gallery and musician could put out a feed which I could follow, with values including date-time, address, info-url, ticket-url, details. My event-feed reader would pull in the gallery's and musician's events from their website, and populate a calendar with them. Moreover, I could set the reader to only display events in the region I care about, so the only gigs of the musician that would appear would be the ones when they come to my town.\nThey seems a simple, decentralised way of following events, but I'm surprised nothing like this already exists?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32304474\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Hoping the collective wisdom of HN can help me with this one:\nI'm currently archiving a site for a client which was built in WordPress [I know! I know!] by creating a static version from it. So I've used `curl` to download the entire site and spent a few days stripping out the tangled mess of WordPress cruft.\nNext in my sites is the CSS. I've consolidated the eleventy billion CSS files strewn throughout WP into one central CSS file, which is about 3000 lines long. And now need to strip out all the unused selectors... of which I suspect there are many, because the site is mostly just plain text articles with occasional illustrations. No fancy-schmancy stuff at all.\nPlenty of advice on the web about using Chrome Dev tools to check for unused CSS against a single page. But this is a site of 500+ pages, so I need something that will crawl the entire project and compile a list of all the CSS used/unused across the entire site.\nOn the face of it this seems like one of those horribly repetitive tasks which would be a nightmare for a human to do, but trivial for a computer. A solution wouldn't even need to automagically strip the CSS out. Even just marking the used elements would allow me to see what was required or not and manually delete the rest. Pseudo-code-ually:\n  for HTML file in project \n  look for class=XXX or id=#YYY\n  look through project CSS file for .XXX or #YYY\n  insert comment /*this is used in file ZZZ.html*/\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32530595\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "My wife and I recently submitted to a mobile game jam on Newgrounds (yes, it's still around). What started as a question of whether we could do it somehow morphed into whether we could do without so many of the seemingly needless complications rampant in our respective industries. My wife thus did all the art as traditional frame-by-frame animation (no puppets or tweening) and I preceded without a game engine. I did use a pre-processor that gives JS a Lisp syntax (Parenscript), because C-syntax is gross. We hope the end result, while definitely of small scope, will serve to inspire some thought as to what is and isn't needed in your next project.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32517495\nPoints: 15\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Recently I was reading about fluid simulation and stumbled upon the Gauss Seidel method. I got interested in how it works and made a program that visualizes the method in action.\nI had the idea of making an interactive book-like thing for a while, so took this as a chance to do just that.\nNote that touch input doesn't work and the layout is targeted towards bigger screens, so it doesn't function properly on mobile.\nIt was fun to make and I wanted to share it. Maybe someone will find it useful. Corrections and feedback are welcome.\nTechnical Stuff\n- A single 1.7MB HTML file with embedded JavaScript and WebAssembly. You can save this single file and double click it to run.\n- A math typesetter from scratch in C that compiles/renders the equations in real-time (uses KaTex fonts and STB true type to rasterize the fonts).\n- Platform code is done using Sokol (tested on windows and web).\n- The UI is done using Dear ImGui (Most of the code is done in C++ to use ImGui without a wrapper except for the equations compiler).\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32371246\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",
