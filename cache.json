Apple products are my personal devices and habe a windows laptop from the company i work for.\nI saw obviously material design on my sites. But for the first time a task given me to remove Bootstrat from a project and use Vuetify (Matrial Design flavored) instead.\nMy experience is more than awful. Who think that the bounce effect on click can be a good thing? Why button texts have to be uppercase? Is the border at bottom really means something?\nI can’t really engage with this design system and i can’t really understand why is this thing so popular.

A common pattern is building something that already exists in much better form as open source software. I usually try to get them to realize the error themselves by asking questions like \"how does this compare to open source library X\" but it doesn't always work. How do you deal with things like this, keeping in mind that I'm not all knowing and could be wrong but also feel a responsibility to protect the larger organization from bad tech.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30955731\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "It seems that the tech community accepts certain dogma in releasing products \"MVP, agile, user-centered design, user studies, etc\".\nYet if these principles are being followed, why does the industry keep pumping low quality products, while Apple is the opposite?\nApple's secrecy does not help. The few articles on google were either outdated (Job's legacy) or blog with opinions and speculations.\nWhat are they doing right that most tech companies miss? Or is it not design, but a distinctive leadership and strategy that works?\nSome \"more verifiable\" sources:\n[1] https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/40448/how-does-apple-manage-to-deliver-its-user-experience\n[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3uR6IDSHSM\nWould love to hear from insiders if possible, thanks.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30928671\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hey, HN! When building user interfaces for smaller and mobile apps you've got quite a few tools to choose from. Figma and the like work great for them. But for the complex projects we do at our UX agency, those tools are a pain to use. Designing a control interface for an industrial machine in Figma doesn't make any fun. You often need to somehow hack the interactions you need into it.\nTo make prototyping complex interfaces easier, we built Antetype.\nWith layouts that really adapt to changing content and (hopefully) easy-to-understand interaction options. For us, it really helps creating complex and working UIs – to test and validate ideas.\nAntetype is also build on web concepts: \nThat means you can use any HTML/CSS tricks you know and also any JS framework you require. We often use that to embed interactive 3D models or working charts (instead of static images).\nVideo of Antetype's features + prototypes built with it: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUBpJlLJrdY\nWebsite with examples + demo videos:\nhttps://www.antetype.com\nRegister to download it (macOS only):\nhttps://cloud.antetype.com/register/\n(You can use it entirely free. No water marks or restrictions. Our paid plan just takes care of hosting if you don't want to do it yourself.)\nI would love to hear your thoughts – we released it to the public just a few weeks ago.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30852905\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "With every major release of Windows, MS seems to just add a new UI design language to the previous ones, making Windows ever more cluttered and inconsistent.\nWith Win11, there was room for MS to finally get rid of legacy designs that have plagued Windows for over 2 decades!! But unfortunately, Win11 is just a new skin on top of a pile of inconsistent design languages from before. Sure, there are improvements to the desktop and the settings app, but anything more serious and you're faced with windows dating back to Windows 95/98.\nThis doesn't seem like a problem that MS would be unaware of. But as much as I'd like to justify their actions by assuming that they still follow their backward compatibility philosophy, they have long crossed the line. Win11 design looks like a slap in the face of the customer. At the same time, MS could easily afford to hire better designers (which I think is not the main problem) or invest in consistent design across their Windows products, and yet they're not doing that.\nI'm happy that many are now switching to Linux just because the alternative (Win11) sucks so much. But frankly, I wish MS would fix this decades-old mess asap.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30817570\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 5",

          "description": "eBPF is an amazing technology that allows safely running user-supplied functions at pretty much arbitrary probe points in a kernel/user space context. Much has been written about how amazing this feature is for kernel observability. But as someone who writes user space code, what I find even more amazing is the support for tracing arbitrary user space programs, with no code changes and low overhead.\nHowever, doing in-depth analysis can get complicated and time-consuming. My goal with wachy was to make this debugging significantly easier/faster to use, by displaying traces in a TUI next to the source code and allowing for interactive drilldown analysis. If you get a chance, check out the start of the demo video since (AFAIK) it's quite unique and gives a much clearer idea than I can provide with just text.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30812988\nPoints: 112\n# Comments: 11",

          "description": "I need to get up from my chair and take a walk at regular intervals for medical reasons, But I often forget to do that when I'm immersed with work, So I wanted a solution which reminds me to take a walk at regular intervals automatically.\nHence I created Butt Mover to solve that problem, It has two parts;\n1. Butt Trigger: An ESP8266 based button switch which goes under a butt cushion on the chair and is connected to the computer.\n2. Butt Mover: The game which starts the task timer (25 minute interval) when we sit on the chair and reminds to take a walk when the timer ends(with audio). When we get up from the chair the break timer (5minutes for 5 tasks and a long break for 30 minutes) starts and reminds to get back to the seat when the timer ends.\nThose who cannot build the Butt Trigger, Can start the timers manually but that removes the major advantage of not having to focus explicitly on Butt Mover.\nI've been using a crude version of this setup for past two years with good improvement in my productivity and health; So I finally created a version which is more accessible to others upon suggestion from many including some from HN.\nI hope you can try Butt Mover, Especially with the Butt Trigger and if you liked what it does then you can also build and sell Butt Trigger for others who are interested.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30804893\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",
