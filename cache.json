It is then left to the receiving web server to determine if and how to use this information.\nWe want to protect the user's privacy by only sending this header on requests if the app developer explicitly opts in to share with services embedded within the WebView. To achieve this and let current online services that depend on this header migrate away from using it, we will run a Deprecation Origin Trial, while removing the header for general traffic. In parallel, we will be developing new privacy-preserving APIs (such as client attestation APIs) to match the use cases where the X-Requested-With header is being used today.\nYou can read more about why we're making this change and how it works over at the Android Developer's Blog in Improving user privacy by requiring opt-in to send X-Requested-With header from WebView.",

          "description": "At work, we recently discussed the issues arising from UX/UI designers using visual tools like Figma or Sketch to create mockups that front-end developers have to manually reverse-engineer into HTML/CSS. While these tools provide useful means of visual expression, they often lead to developers having to infer design vocabulary from the mockups themselves, causing a loss of value and potential misinterpretations.\nAs a community, how can we bridge the gap between visual and text-based web design to preserve design reasoning and intent? Are there better ways to communicate design requirements without relying solely on visual mockups? How can we emphasize the importance of a clear connection between description and visual presentation in modern web design tools to avoid costly mistakes and improve accessibility?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35386850\nPoints: 7\n# Comments: 5",

Here’s a video: https://player.vimeo.com/video/797476910.\nGetting from a product idea to a design is too hard. Wireframing tools (e.g. Balsamiq) are limited and their output is too low-fidelity to get people excited about the idea. On the other hand, high-fidelity design tools (e.g. Figma) require advanced skills and are better for tweaking fine details than hashing out a big picture. Meanwhile, companies have an insatiable need to make new screens and change existing ones, and hiring more designers is time-consuming and expensive.\nDavid and I were on the design tools team at Airbnb when we realized there’s another solution: let designers encode their knowledge (e.g. design rules …",

          "description": "Hi HN, I'm Chun Rapeepat.\nLast week I started playing with GPT-4 and tried different ways to use it to optimize my dev workflow. It was fun, and I was just blown away by what GPT-4 can do.\nThe idea of CodePrompt first came to mind when I read \"Show HN: GPT Repo Loader – load entire code repos into GPT prompts\" [1]. It was precisely what I wanted to do! So I tried it.\nThe GPT Repo Loader works pretty well on a small codebase; However, due to its limitations in loading all files and content into the prompt, I still ran into token context limit issues and needed to copy/edit the code myself.\nThat's when I started working on CodePrompt. Instead of loading the entire repo, why not just load only relevant files or portions of code (or function headers?) that need for the requirement?\nHow I designed the user journey of CodePrompt.xyz:\n1. Choose a GPT model.\n2. Select a repo that you want to work with.\n3. Pick the relevant files that you want to include in the prompt.\n4. Add specific instructions and remove irrelevant codes as needed.\n5. Copy the prompt to your chosen GPT model to generate the desired output. Chat & Iterate.\n6. If you want to do something else, just go to (3) again.\nThis allows me to easily generate prompts to do something like \n- Implement features that evolve edits on multiple files\n- Create new components while reusing existing codebase\n- Generate code with the same style as other files, etc.\nI would love to hear all your feedback and ideas on how I can improve it. Or if you want to chat, feel free to ping me on my Twitter @chunrapeepat.\nP.S. The project is 100% open-source and free to use. \nCheck it out: https://github.com/chunrapeepat/codeprompt\n[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35191303\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35370579\nPoints: 5\n# Comments: 2",

There are a couple of challenges that I can think of:\n- many bidders for a specific item requiring multiple nodes\n- accepting a bid is a transaction?\n- ordering of bids as they come in\n- invalidating bids once and reflecting that to a customer very quickly\nUsually systems that are distributed that also need to be fast choose eventual consistency, but I am not sure how that would work in a bidding environment.

          "description": "I'm thrilled to share with you all a personal milestone in my life that I feel compelled to celebrate. My girlfriend, Julia, has been pursuing her dream of becoming a UX/UI designer for almost a year now while working in logistics, and today she has finally published her first project!\nI can't express how proud I am of her for putting in the hard work to make her dream a reality. It's not easy to balance work and study (you know, sleepless nights to chase a dream), but she has done it with great determination.\nNow that Julia has completed her first project, she's excited to take the next step in her journey and is actively searching for job opportunities in UX/UI design. If any of you have any leads or know of any open positions in this field, we would be immensely grateful for any advice or guidance you can offer.\nI know some of you may think it's a small feat, but to us, it's a significant accomplishment worth toasting. As a community of innovators and dreamers, I hope we can all take inspiration from Julia's story and strive to follow our passions relentlessly.\nLet's raise a glass to Julia and all the aspiring designers out there who are working hard to turn their dreams into reality. Cheers!\nHer project published on Behance: https://www.behance.net/gallery/166920067/TagPalette-UXUI-Design\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35320207\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Like many people here, I have been using ChatGPT almost since its launch. Considering the massive adoption, I am a bit surprised that the interface hasn't evolved one bit in 3 months.\nMy issues:\n-  Why is there no shortcut to my account/profile settings from ChatGPT's left panel?\n-  Why are my DALL-E money and ChatGPT/API money kept separate? These are two products from the same company, asking twice for my CC number.\n-  Why do I have to refresh my page manually every time something went wrong? Couldn't the page either refresh itself or recreate a clean connexion?\n-  Why isn't there a \"log in\" button from OpenAI's landing page, plus a SSO detecting that I am already connected and linking (for instance) to my account, the products I use, etc.?\n-  Why are their URLs so confusing? DALL-E is living at \"labs.openai.com\" (for the actual product) or \"openai.com/product/dall-e-2\" (for the product presentation). For ChatGPT it's \"chat.openai.com/chat\" (why \"chat\" twice btw?), but it's \"platform.openai.com/playground\" for the playground. Of course no page links to the others so you have to go back to the landing to access any of them (or access them through Google).\n-  And finally, why is the search on their website so bad? I was looking for the playground, but \"openai.com/search?q=playground\" sucked so much that I had to use Google to find it. And we are talking about an AI company indexing its own pages.\nI understand OpenAI has other important things to do right now, but these are minor issues that would take a mediocre dev a few days to fix. This would easily make me 10% happier with a 1/1000000th of the resources needed to improve their models. Also, remember that Google got huge in the beginning by caring about stuff like this. So, why does nobody care?\nEDIT: formatting\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35236635\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Do I need to get an EE master’s (VLSI focus, interested in this field) to understand the field better so that I can use AI to improve chip design and manufacture life cycle (as a CS grad)?\nI am a cs grad, but I liked electronics since first year's summer break when I took a practical course in electronics, then I played around with embedded systems & ai & robotics and web dev's study materials for all of my college years and never got past any intro course in any of them. now after graduation I feel like I know nothing and interested in a lot of things and not being able to decide what to choose. now I am interested in both ai & vlsi and can't decide between:\n1.using ai to automate the build process of ic chips. or,\n2.using vlsi to design ai-specific chips to advance the field more and more.\nbeing ignorant about both fields, I can't make a decision. and I feel like I have to study both no matter what order of the two I pursue. so, I chose to start with ai as a tool for solving problems and then later in my career I pursue an MS in EE to understand the kind of problems in this field and how to solve it using ai. and this order is safer for me, giving my cs background, than to shift my career to EE as a fresh grad.\ndoes this make any sense, or I am just wasting my time for lack of experience to decide?\nand what is the job title for something like this? is it related to a VLSI CAD engineer?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35098130\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

There is a lack of standardization in the industry, some mention compensation, some mention hard requirements, some are more flexible in requirements.\nI'm curious if you were to build a job description standard, what types of fields would you want included? Some ideas of the top of my head:\n- Compensation Bands\n- If hard requirements are present, an explanation of why (i.e we don't have capacity for mentorship, so we are looking for X years of work experience)\n- LinkedIn of the hiring manager\n- LinkedIn of the existing team\n- A detailed over of the interview process\nWould love to know what others think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35082448\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

However, it seems the new owner has lost interest - more and more bugs keep showing up and there is no way to contact support. So I'm looking for a new reader. It would be great if it had a fast, minimalist web interface, mobile support, generous free tier (long enough for me to decide whether I like the service or not) and customer support.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35440641\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 3",

          "description": "I ask this because so often I see people recommending tools and techniques by saying things like \"this dramatically increased my productivity!\" or \"this sped up my workflow by an order of magnitude!\"\nHow can we take such claims seriously? Most things do not improve our productivity THAT much. However, some things truly do.\nLet me give some examples of things I think truly have \"dramatically improved\" my productivity.\n  - testing, specifically integration tests\n  - memory safety (garbage collection, borrow checker, etc.)\n  - version control (git, etc.)\n  - closures and lambdas\n  - unix pipes and the idea of composing larger programs out of smaller ones\n  - Chrome debugger when working with javascript\n    - I hesitate to say \"debuggers\" in general because I actually think GDB didn't \"dramatically\" improve my productivity back when I programmed in C. And I don't even use a debugger at all when I program in python. But the Chrome debugger has numerous features I use all the time.\n\n  - static type systems\n    - could be a small win but I don't find myself \"dramatically more productive\"\n  - TDD\n  - IDEs\n    - some IDEs are better than others, but I have yet to experience a dramatic increase in productivity simply by using a new IDE. Text editor + terminal is pretty strong tbh.\n  - serverless architecture\n    - I could see the argument for scaling concerns, but at a smaller scale I don't see a productivity boost compared to a monolith Rails/Django app\n  - classes and class-style OOP, inheritance\n    - I haven't written a class in a long time, and I haven't used inheritance in a REALLY long time. I just don't think these are huge wins in most cases. Note that I'm not even advocating for FP here. I program in a procedural style most of the time in all honesty.\n\nThanks! I look forward to seeing the replies.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35350969\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on ways to understand (intentional not saying measure) productivity of software engineers with metrics. I know it's a polarising topic and difficult to tackle. Usually the path of discussion goes to \"commits are not relevant\", \"my situation is unique\", \"requirements are changing\", and so forth. But in the same time, after so many projects delivered and considering the maturity of tooling we have today (acknowledging that this make it also very complex), there are many, many things which are kind of predictable and similar to other delivered products. Outside a small percentage of developers which work on innovations, r&d and areas which by nature are unpredictable, the vast majority are just doing the same stuff.\nSo what are your ways of understanding that someone is productive or not which is not based on gut, perception and other subjective factors?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35245329\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 8",

Personally, I use two and had been thinking it is annoying not to have a dedicated area for code, game engine, api, chatgpt. It seems like a difficult balance to see proper information at once.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35099075\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hi HN!\nI am quite excited as this is my second product, launched today: Versionfeeds.\nhttps://versionfeeds.com\nWhat is Versionfeeds? I was quite annoyed by the fact that I had no central place where I could see all the software releases. I use software a lot, be it at my job, to build my side projects, or tools hosted on my NAS at home. It's literally dozens, if not hundreds of tools, packages or even programming languages. And most of them receive updates regularly.\nThat is why I built Versionfeeds. It allows me to bundle all the releases for the software I need and love, into one dedicated feed. At the moment, all public repositories on Github and Gitlab are available. You can also search on npm (Javascript) and Packagist (PHP) for your software. More providers will come soon.\nThe feeds adhere to the Atom standard and can be consumed with any feed reader. If maintainers use markdown in their release notes, it will be converted to HTML.\nAny feedback, wishes and ideas are welcome. Please share your thoughts with me. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35069802\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "When I make applications on my own account that are server-side rendered I frequently use CSS to style things in a way similar to what I think CSS was intended for initially,  that is,  I apply styles to meaningful parts of the document (e.g. \"div.statusbar\", \"table.postlisting th\".)\nFrequently I work on these things on and off for months or years and eventually they become a hot mess.\nI'm looking for something that will help me have some discipline.  I do not like BEM, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and other frameworks that want to impose alien structures on CSS.  I like the intention of SASS/SCSS but don't like the idea of complicating my build system.  (I like the idea of CSS Nesting as it works in Chrome but Firefox doesn't have it yet unfortunately.  I want to use the latest features but I need support for Firefox and Mobile Safari with Chrome as a distant third.)  I would consider using a JS polyfill and I am using jinja2 template so anything I can bake into my python back end (maybe compile & cache compiled CSS) would be possible.\nAny advice for frameworks or other organizing principles?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35223553\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

I've never worked with compiled templates but they seem interesting, though I don't know their cost/benefit tradeoffs very well yet.\nYour choice of language, stack, syntax preference, what-have-you!

But in future, there's easier contact points to jump to.\nOtherwise, now all the buttons work, and TIL: mash the shoulder buttons can equate to a totalled joycon!",

          "description": "I have a little Etsy store for gameboy repair (though it's currently just carts at the moment), and I had a Pokémon Crystal come in. It didn't load at all and I found corrosion around the cart pins.\nCarefully scratching away the solder had it loading up again, but the far right contact (the ground) had solder under the gold finger and I was worried it'll eventually fall away. Originally I wanted to swap all the parts to a new PCB, but that requires actually purchasing another Pokémon Crystal (which sell for around £20-30) - which didn't make sense.\nUltimately I cleaned as much as I could under the pad and then used solder mask to secure the gold finger down and now it's secure and safe for a good many years of usage. Returned to a very happy customer :)",

I figured there was a broken trace in there somewhere and something that would be simple to fix.\nOr perhaps a build up of carbon on the silicon pads that \"just\" needed cleaning.\nIt turns out that these controllers, instead of bridging the pad when the buttons are pressed, use a resistor (the dark rectangles) that when pressed, the resistance increases (or decreases…though I'm fairly sure increases) and that is measured.\nThe problem is that over time, as they're pressed more and more, the resistance naturally builds up as the resistor fails under the physical pressure and eventually it can't tell when the button is depressed.\nThe only solution is to buy an entirely new membrane (seen in the photo). But now it works!",

If it's dirty it can prevent the device from starting or it can affect the \"quality\" of power, i.e. the power LED flashes from green to red.\nAlthough the board itself looked in good condition, once I lifted the whole thing out, it turned out a transformer (better known as T1) had cracked open and the coil of wires were all over the place. I replaced that and power returned.\nThe original GBA had a funny story attached, it was in an original pink shell and the (I assume) kid that owned it wanted something \"cooler\" (again, assume, but indulge me), so they used a black marker pen all over it.\nHowever, this board was destined for the teal(ish) shell and available to buy.",

The usual tech nonsense will resume (one day!).\n\nI hadn't written anything on my blog for a while, or at least nothing that had flowed naturally so my \"flavour of funk\" post did come easily and it was good.\nThe Monday before that post (the evening before) I attended a (nearly impromptu) meetup run under Beyond Tellerrand from Marc Thiele and Storyblok. I saw friends who I've not seen in, what felt like a long time. I felt physically sick the whole time, in my guts but seeing talks, hearing ideas, seeing my friends faces - it was overall positive.\nThe next day I finally returned to the gym. It was gentle and I wrote the aforementioned blog post on the treadmill. It flowed out of me and the responsive was warm and friendly (thank you).\nThat evening I also had dinner with a long standing friend. So long that we agreed that we'd meet on the same day every month - which makes making sure we see each other much easier. It was nice, and they'd read my post (and are probably reading this post too, so hey ❤️).\nFinally on the Thursday I started individual therapy (or counselling) properly (I'd had an introduction session the week before). I realised, and had to think carefully about it, that I had had a good week.\nIn the week that followed (last week), I've been trying to focus my thoughts on positive things to tell myself. I'm working on quietening down Bob's voice in my head, and when it's quiet, I'd like to begin to fill that emptiness with positive things, nice things, in my head.\nIt's still early days, like those early pages in a book, those first weeks on a diet or at the gym, but it's positive. I'm hopeful.",
