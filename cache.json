          "description": "Last year, Interop 2022, a collaborative cross-browser initiative, was hugely successful in getting 15 key features implemented interoperably. As developers, we can enjoy the fruits of this collaboration, with features like container queries, cascade layers and dynamic viewport units going from little or no browser support to almost full support in the space of a year.\nInterop 2023 has just been announced, expanding to 26 focus areas. Some exciting CSS features include the :has() pseudo-class, which is already supported in some browsers, as well as Level 4 media queries, math functions, and font palette features, which enable custom coloured fonts.\nRead the Interop teams’ write-ups here:\nWebKit\nGoogle\nIgalia\nMicrosoft\nMozilla\nBocoup",

That means there’s no server building the pages on demand. Instead, every time I write a blog post in markdown and commit the file to the Github repository, the site is re-built — with Eleventy generating a static HTML page from my markdown file — and deployed on Netlify’s servers. Pretty cool, right?\nIn order to set up automated deployments you need to link your Github repository to your Netlify account, then configure your build settings — including the build command you want to use (e.g. npm run build), and the directory to publish from. This isn’t a tutorial on how to deploy…",

Also, I was just sick of looking at it! So this design is a bit more stripped back visually, without to many unnecessary flourishes, while still keeping some nice little touches, like animated underlines on hover. Other improvements include a better mobile experience (via the expanding/collapsing tag menu), and the ability to filter by category of post (currently “articles”, “notes” or “quick tips”, which I might add to over time).\nIf I had any se…",

We have this card component that displays a health summary for the section of the app the user is currently inspecting (which could be a wind turbine, a system within that turbine, or the entire wind farm). Generally we want to show that towards the top left of the screen, with some other information on the right. On certain pages however, the information on the right will be absent, so we want the health summary component to go full width. Easy enough, but we also want to style the component differently when it takes up the entire width by aligning the text to the left and giving it a more horizontal layout.\nWhen we have two widgets to display, the left one should have center…",

          "description": "Last year I got into Gunpla, a hobby where you build little plastic model anime robots. What I like most about the hobby is that the models are “press-fit”, meaning you can build the entire model by pressing the parts together with your fingers. No gluing, no painting, just fingers. You can follow the directions and have a little plastic robot model in one sitting. That low-barrier of entry is a key part of what makes Gunpla fun.\nAlthough tools are not required, a handful of tools improve the experience and output. As I’ve been progressing at Gunpla, my modest toolset has evolved. This post is a half “how it started / how it’s going” post about my Gunpla tools and half a reflection about tools in general. What are tools for? Why do we choose them? Are the more expensive tools worth it? Let…",

          "description": "We are creating some How-To Videos for Luro. Exciting to be at that point in product development, but it would be nice if our videos had captions from day one to set a precedent. We could pay to have them all transcribed, or pay for some automated caption service, or even upload them all to YouTube and get transcriptions once those finish processing… but ughck, those options are extra work and not “lean” in spirit.\nThat’s when we noticed Slack started adding transcriptions for any video we upload. We had transcriptions! In the spirit of patching the Web, I wrote a one-liner console script to yoink those VTT transcriptions from Slack for Web with a little URL hacking.\nFind the uploaded video in Slack, click “View Transcript” in the caption below the video, then click the “Expand” button to see the video and the transcript side-by-side. Then put this in the console:\n\n$('video').poster.split('/').slice(0,-1).join('/') + '/file.vtt'\n\n\n⚠️ Warning: Auto-captions —what the deaf community lovingly refer to as “auto-craptions”— have limitations. For example, it transcribes our “Luro” as “Laura” and is entirely wrong and non-sensical at times. I point this out to show that you’ll need a human in the mix to proofread and fix captions. Be extra alert when dealing with technical content.\nAnyways, hope this is helpful.",

This change is already in\nFirefox, will land in Chrome from version 110,\nand is expected to land in\nSafari soon.\nThe Web Share API allows you to share\ntext, URLs, or files. In its simplest form, the share code looks something like this:\ntry {\n  await navigator.share({\n    title: 'Title',\n    text: 'Text',\n    url: location.href,\n  });\n} catch (err) {\n  console.error(`${err.name}: ${err.message}`);\n}\nIf a sharing action needs to happen in a third-party iframe, a\nrecent spec change requires you to explicitly allow the\noperation. Do this by adding an allow attribute\nto the <iframe> tag with a value of web-share. This tells the browser that the embedding site allows the embedded\nthird-party iframe to trigger the share action.\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <body>\n    <h1>Web Share in third-party iframes</h1>\n    <!-- The embedding page is hosted on https://example.com/index.html. -->\n    <iframe allow=\"web-share\" src=\"https://third-party.example.com/iframe.html\"></iframe>\n  </body>\n</html>\nYou can see this in action in a demo on Glitch\nand view the\nsource code.\nFailing to provide the attribute will result in a NotAllowedError with the message\nFailed to execute 'share' on 'Navigator': Permission denied. This limitation was agreed by all\nbrowser vendors to improve the privacy and security of users and to prevent bad actors, for example,\nabusive ads, from triggering unexpected share actions.",

Pairing great web design with performance ensures every site you build is both outstanding to the eye and seamless to use.\nAccording to Think With Google, your website’s bounce rate can increase by 32% as page load time increases from one to three seconds. This emphasizes how crucial usability is to your website’s success: Without quality visuals and quick loading times, visitors simply won’t have the chance or patience to engage with your design.\nWhile website imagery—such as product photos, artwork, or event videos—plays a big role in the story your web design relays to visitors, these visual elements have the potential to slow down your site if they’re not properly optimized.

This graphic design trend took the world by storm post-WWII for a good reason. The clean and straightforward lines did a lot to inspire future trends, including the minimalist movement that so many designers are so fond of.\nAnd although these designs definitely give off a “retro” vibe, mid-century modern elements in graphic design aren’t going anywhere any time soon. Playful, shape-based lettering is still prevalent throughout many modern designs, along with many geometric stylings.\nIn fact, the colors, more than anything else, tend to give most MCM graphic designs a “retro” feeling. Trade in the earthy browns, oranges, and greens for some greyscale and neons, and you have a more modern Mid-century Modern aesthetic that any Palm Springs resident would be ecstatic about.  ■\nMid-Century Modern Graphic Design Inspiration\n\n    \n      Shot Link\n\n    \n\n    \n      Shot Link\n\n    \nKyle Anthony Miller, \n      Ethan Silva, \n      Victoria Fernández. \n    Row 2:\n      Whitney Anderson, \n      Steve Wolf, \n      Whitney Anderson. \n    Row 3:\n      Zara Picken, \n      Lisa Engler, \n      Mia Ditmanson. \n    Row 4:\n      Justin Mezzell, \n      Justin Mezzell, \n      Nicola Broderick. \n    Row 5:\n      Tracy Niven, \n      Chad Gowey for Blindtiger Design, \n      Normform. \n\n\n\n\n\nMore design inspiration\nDesign by the Decades: Y2K graphic design trends\nDesign by the Decades: 80s graphic design trends\nGet inspired: Retro branding with a modern twist",

          "description": "I like below applications from UI/UX perspective \n1. Canva.com -- Really makes designing graphics pretty easy and has a easy to use, intuitive UI\n2. Trading view -- Shows the data heavy application in an easy way. No wonder it has become the go-to application for traders.      \nAlso what is final goal of UI/UX ? How would you measure UI/UX of an application.  Is it to look good ? Is it to have all the features ? Is it to help customer get the \"intended\" job done as quickly and efficiently as possible? Is it to be communicative ?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34656809\nPoints: 9\n# Comments: 10",

          "description": "Hello HN!\nJust shipped my first digital product, Design Navigator: https://navigator.designdisciplin.com/\nI've been designing, studying design, and teaching design for many years. One of the biggest challenges I faced was how my profession is divided into different \"worlds\". Designers employed at companies, freelancers, academics, creators... All seem to live in different worlds.\nI developed Design Navigator to help designers choose their world and excel in it.\nIt starts with a simple questionnaire and recommends to you one of four worlds, along with a set of resources to dive deep: employment, freelancing, founder, and creator. Of course, the best way to use it is to check out all four of the \"worlds\", get into some of the resources, and then make up your mind.\nBuilt using Next.js, TailwindCSS, Vercel, etc. – nothing fancy from a tech standpoint. But I'm particularly proud of the front end design, wanted to show off some of my skills, and it was received well.\nOver the years I've learned a lot from HN, and incorporated many YC resources into Design Navigator, especially for the Founder path. While it's mainly intended for designers (and particularly UI, UX, web designers, etc.), I'm sure many of us in tech can find some inspiration in it. I hope you enjoy it!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34640075\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

Designers know what they're signing up for and can still benefit greatly from the experience. They have the chance to learn and improve their skills, and may even end up with a one-on-one client project as a result.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34639554\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I've been working as a software engineer for a little over half a decade (2 jobs).\nIn my experience, every time I get specifications from a product manager (PM) or mock ups from a designer, they are very vague and incomplete. When I'm told to implement things based on these specifications, I often find myself going back to them to get missing details and ask about use cases not covered. Sometimes, I'll have partway implemented something only for the specs to suddenly change after asking about a different part!\nI'm aware many jobs list working with PMs and UI/UX designers as a requirement, but it has gone past an acceptable level for me - I do not want to use the word \"incompetent\" to describe how I view their work output, but that is how I've slowly grown to feel about it.\nSo a few questions:\n1. Are poor specifications a common occurrence in the industry?\n2. Is there a way to improve the initial and ongoing quality of specifications as a non-PM and non-designer?\n3. Should software engineers have a say in the specs or should they defer to PMs and designers and stick to technical implementation?\n4. What kinds of places will give software engineers control over these specifications?\n5. Is there a role which combines pm/designer/engineer into one?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34559063\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 8",

          "description": "I've been coming to Hacker News since 2005. Over that time it's grown by many orders of magnitude.\nThe quality of the links has fluctuated but on the whole have stayed strong and, if anything, improved over time. I don't know what the filtering process is but it works well - the articles feel pure and deeply interesting.\nBut the comments are trickier. As the size of the audience has grown, so have the number of comments. Which has the potential to be really interesting, except for the propensity of the UI to drive both readers and commenters deep into rabbitholes.\nI used to love seeing the breadth of reactions to an article (or a new company). I could scan the comments to see what Hacker News thought. I quickly could get an idea of different perspectives and opinions. I could absorb the reaction of the Silicon Valley Coding Diaspora.\nThese days though it feels, at best, a deep, cloistered exploration of one POV, and at worst a triggered cascade of pedantry.\nThere are still amazing people and amazing observations in there. But they're not easy to get to. There's no easy way to scan the comments to get a sense of the breadth of reaction - it's just a case of wading through all of them.\nBack when I was in my 20s and soaking up everything I possibly could, I would happily invest that time. These days it doesn't feel like such a good trade-off.\nAnd I fear that in turn that penalises the potential breadth of reaction that this remarkable audience posesses. And reduces the participation of others who have less time - many of whom are more senior (decide for yourself whether you value that perspective).\nIf I could wave a wand, I'd love to see the threads collapsed by default. I feel like there are lot of potential UI wins that could further broaden engagement.\nWould love to hear everyone else's thoughts...\n(Also... and I'm sure I'm thousandth person to ask this... how on earth is it that there is no dark mode to this dev-mecca?!)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34545536\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 3",

We’re building a tool that lets you design user state machines with an SDK so that you can run them in your product.\nWe offer a React SDK that lets you create instances of those machines for any user of your product and exposes methods for transitioning the state of the user—effectively moving them through the machine. Dopt then acts as a persistence layer for the users’ machine state. We call our machines “flows”. Dopt lets you send in data about your users (identify calls/properties) and lets non-devs define rules based on that data for which users should enter the flows. Non-devs can also update content and other custom properties that can be referenced via the SDK.\nFor example, with Dopt’s SDK you can build:\n- a multi-step, interactive product walkthr…",

          "description": "I'm pretty sure I originally found this on HN some years ago, maybe someone here can help me find it again.\nI remember a video of a very small hydro power demo, about a meter across, something along the lines of a gravitational water vortex power plant[0], but instead of the usual turbine they had a pretty big, uh, piece (\"runner\"?) in the middle of the chamber with the vortex, taking up most of the space. I believe the idea was to extract energy from very low flows. I seem to recall the people presenting it were Swiss, or something else vaguely germanic, but I'm not really sure.\nAnyway, I've thought about this thing for years, decided to try to find it again, and mostly failed in my google-fu. I don't remember anything of the specific language used to describe it, just the visual. If anyone knows good search terms for this, I'm happy to hear those as well.\nThanks!\n[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation_water_vortex_power_plant, discussed here https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16891441\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34448284\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "I've noticed that I'm design-blind. As long as something is functional, and I have an accurate conceptual model of how it works, I can deal with it. The important part (to me) is whether I can do the things I want done without the product getting in the way. For example, Jira does a terrible job of this, by getting in the way.\nWhat I've come to realise is that this is only a small part of the picture. There's a lot more that goes into design: a product helping you build an accurate model, showing you what's possible, getting out of your way, and the emotional positive response because of the sheer attention to detail.\nRecently reading Design of Everyday Things, and I _love_ it because it helped me formulate a model of what objectively good design looks like.\nI read RefactoringUI as well, and this felt a lot more 'here are some good rule of thumbs to follow'. Awesome, but I feel I'm still fumbling in the dark. I find myself falling back to these because I don't know better.\nSo, do you have any tips or resources for helping improve design sense?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34425693\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 2",

You can use Sheets for internal tools, BI, ad hoc analysis, you name it.\nHowever, it's extremely tricky to sync data between G sheets and NoSQL databases like MongoDB. This limits the usefulness of either tool.\nSo, what options are there? There are a few.\nMethod #1: Write your own script\nYou could build your own in-house solution using Google's API and MongoDB change streams.

          "description": "I'm normally someone who builds my core React components for a given project from scratch; it's not hard and I have maximum control if needs change (and don't have to go read a bunch of docs)\nBut right now I need to build a boring admin interface for somebody, with limited time to dedicate to it and it doesn't matter what the look and feel is or anything. So I'm considering pulling in a library like MUI so I can more quickly just bang out an interface and move forward\nQuestion is: does Material UI's convenience outweigh the extra complexity of adding a dependency, reading its docs, learning its conventions, etc? Especially for a relatively quick and simple thing\n(MUI-specific anecdotes only please; not interested in speculation or in discussions about the broader question of whether to add a dependency to a project)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34383168\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I hope it's not a too big can of worm I am opening here, and I can imagine it is quite subjective, but it would be nice to hear other people's opinions about this.\nI have programmed for quite a long time in both Python and Go and I also experimented with rewriting the same solution in each language - for smaller projects.\nPerformance Go of course beats Python in almost all aspects, but what about productivity?\nMy experience is in general Python is a lot more productive, with less code but if you don't take care of keeping things well-organized then the productivity falls for bigger projects.\nWhile on the other hand, Go seems to be more linear (similar) productivity even if you have a larger code base.\nWhat is your experience with productivity, especially as the project matures?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34552271\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "By combining a couple of open-source projects, I created a simple, personalised solution for consuming your favourite RSS feeds via email. I built it for myself, but after a few tweaks, I opened up the repository for anyone with a GitHub account to fork or clone. To use it, just configure your own favourite RSS feeds, set up a cron schedule, and provide your own SMTP server.\nThe email can be fully customised and is made with this great new library: react-email. The project includes a development server, which you can run locally to test any tweaks you want to make to the email template.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34518234\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

I downloaded archived RSS files in archive.org, like for http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml. Unfortunately I have noticed that some days are missing in the archive.org.\nI think it is a good idea, if you have a favorite site, which has a RSS source, to make a call to store it regularly in archive.org for 'the next generations'. https://help.archive.org/help/save-pages-in-the-wayback-machine/.\nI have updated my RSS client to make a such call everyday, even for my fav YouTube RSS sources.\nEven if 'link rot' gets in a way, this might be insightful to see at least link, or title, or description of the RSS entry. Historians might consider it useful some day.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34424957\nPoints: 16\n# Comments: 4",

I know everyone has different preferences and work styles, but I can’t help but think what I’ve been able to apply would be useful for other developers at my company.\nUndoubtedly, there are other developers at my company have their own set of programs/workflows they use to increase their efficiency that I think could be useful to me and others.\nI'm curious to know what strategies other developers use or have used within their company to share productivity tips and programs with their colleagues. For example, is there a dedicated Teams/Slack channel, an internal wiki, or some other type of software where engineers can share/demo programs and shortcuts they use in their day-to-day work?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34330634\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I've been experimenting with a smart RSS reader and I've been using Superfeedr to ingest content.  Superfeedr monitors RSS feeds and calls a webhook when content arrives,  I stuff these into an Amazon SQS and then spool them out at my leisure.\nMy system requires a fairly high volume (1000's of articles) to train a machine learning model so I have been focusing on high volume feeds like preprints from the arXiv,  news from the Guardian, etc.\nNow Superfeedr charges 10¢ per feed per month,  my bill right now is $3 a month.  It's reasonable that I can subscribe to about 100 feeds on Superfeedr but subscribing to 1000 feeds seems pricey to me.\nThere are a lot of independent blogs out there that publish an article every week or every six months.  What they all have in common is that somebody has to poll an RSS file many many many times per article ingested.  W/ superfeedr it makes for high costs but it is a hassle even if I built my own RSS ingest system.\nOne thing that would help would be consolidated RSS feeds that aggregate posts from a large number of blogs.  Are there good ones out there?  Are there other answers to problem of polling hundreds or thousands of independent blogs?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34330134\nPoints: 11\n# Comments: 9",

I´ve also developed several full stack applications with relatively complex backends (mainly Ruby/Ruby on Rails).\nI'm currently on a teaching non-tenure track (teaching web technologies), which I love, but the pay in my country is very low.\nI'm confident I have the creativity and formal knowledge to develop high quality static websites. So I'm looking for opportunities.\nThat said, I return to my initial question: is there still demand for semantic, performant, custom static websites?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34526584\nPoints: 16\n# Comments: 8",

          "description": "Hey HN, my name is Mokshit and I'm really interested in web-performance and web-development. At the time of writing this, I'm a junior in high school.\nMacaron is a typesafe CSS-in-JS library with zero runtime, colocation, maximum safety and productivity.\nThe motivation behind it is that runtime CSS-in-JS libraries, that is most of the CSS-in-JS libs, add alot of bloat to web apps and have a considerable performance drop with a bundle size increase. Alot of them also don't support more performant ways of building web apps like streaming markup. Most of the current compile-time CSS-in-JS libraries try to fix this, but have some or the other drawback like not offering colocation, or not being type-safe.\nToday, Macaron does all this with a compiler that extracts all the style declarations at compile-time and converts them to static css files while also letting you author the type-safe styles in the same file as your application code. It supports both - a vanilla styling API and a styled-component API with support for multiple frameworks like SolidJS and React and build tools like Vite and Esbuild. Macaron is currently missing a webpack plugin, but that will also be published soon, making it compatible with almost all bundlers.\nThere's a ton of room for improvement in this space, and I feel like macaron is a step in that direction.\nGithub - https://github.com/macaron-css/macaron\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34368626\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",
