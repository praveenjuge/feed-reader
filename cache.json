          "description": "I’ve previously written about the problems with regular sticky menus.\nIn response to those issues, some people suggest showing and hiding the menu as the user scrolls up and down.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tBondir’s sticky menu appears and disappears as the user scrolls\n\t\n\nThis seems smart because:\nthe menu gets out of the way to allow users to focus on the content\nit allows users to access the menu without having to scroll back to the top\nBut this approach is worse than regular sticky menus.\nHere’s why:\nProblem #1: They’re distracting\nThis is because as the user scrolls the content to fit in the viewport, the menu will suddenly appear.\nGood design doesn’t guess (wrongly) about what users need.\nProblem #2: They’re hard to control\nThis is because scrolling up too much reveals the menu when it’s not wanted. And scrolling down a bit by accident will hide it when it is wanted.\nGood design doesn’t take control away.\nProblem #3: They cause dizziness and nausea\nThis is because animation can cause dizziness, nausea, headaches and more.\nGood design avoids physical stress.\nProblem #4: They can impact performance\nThis is because JavaScript is needed to react to the scroll event which can drain the battery and degrade performance especially on low-powered devices.\nGood design is lightweight.\nWhat to do instead\nKeep pages short: Sticky menus are a symptom of long pages so fix the root cause.\nJust let users scroll: It’s a myth that scrolling is a problem. Even on mobile, the top of the page is a flick or 2 away mostly.\nPut relevant links in context: For example, add a subscribe form to the end of a post or add a CTA to a pricing section.\nUse a back-to-top link: They’re relatively unobtrusive (but only do this once you exhaust the other options).",

          "description": "In 2009 I was working on the Argos checkout flow.\nWe were considering focusing the first input when the page loads. The idea was to save users a click (never a good sign). Back then we had to use JS, but now we have the HTML5 autofocus attribute.\nEither way, automatically focusing the first input causes 5 specific problems that degrade UX.\nHere they are:\nProblem #1: it makes the page jump unexpectedly\nWhen any normal web page loads, focus remains at the top.\nWith autofocus, focus jumps suddenly to the first input.\nBut this is disorientating and may cause users to think something has gone wrong.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAutomatically focusing the input makes the page jump\n\t\n\nProblem #2: it stops users scrolling with the keyboard\nUsers often scroll a web page after page load by pressing ↑ and ↓.\nWith autofocus, the keys are ignored because the input is focused.\nThis makes the interface feel broken.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe up and down keys get ignored as focus is inside the input\n\t\n\nProblem #3: it stops users going back with the keyboard\nSome users navigate back by keyboard using #+← for example.\nWith autofocus, the shortcut is ignored because the input is focused.\nThis slows users down.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe keyboard shortcut to go back is ignored as focus is inside the input\n\t\n\nProblem #4: it’s unexpected for screen reader users\nWhen a web page loads, a screen reader announces the page title.\nWith autofocus, the input’s label is announced instead.\nThis is disorientating and causes users to lose context.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe screen reader announces the input instead of the page\n\t\n\nProblem #5: it works badly on mobile\nOn mobile, focusing an input usually opens the keyboard.\nWith autofocus this doesn’t happen. On Android, for example, the input is focused but the user has to tap again to open the keyboard.\nThis makes the interface feel broken.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tOn Android, the input is focused but the user needs to tap \n\t\n\nJust let users focus the first input\nGood design puts users in control.",

          "description": "In 2016 I worked at the Department for Work and Pensions.\nI was working on a complex form field made up of nested fieldsets. It was inaccessible which surprised me because I was only using fieldsets, legends, labels and radio buttons. Nothing fancy.\nBut as I did more research, it became clearer that nested fieldsets can be problematic.\nHere’s why:\nProblem #1: screen readers only announce the inner legend\nLet’s say you have appointment times organised by day and period.\nA fieldset for each day and for morning and afternoon\n\t\n\nIf the user moves from 3:15pm on Tuesday to 9:55am on Wednesday, screen readers will announce ‘9:55am, morning’. They will not announce ‘Wednesday 23 October’.\nThis is confusing and may cause users to select the wrong date. Or it may cause them to traverse the page line by line because they don’t trust the interface.\nProblem #2: screen readers won’t announce the end of a fieldset\nLet’s say you have a question that says ‘Do you like chocolate?’ And selecting ‘Yes’ reveals a nested question that says ‘Do you prefer light or dark chocolate?’\nRadio buttons that reveal another question\n\t\n\nIf the user moves from ‘Dark chocolate’ to ‘No’, screen readers will not announce that they left the inner fieldset.\nThis is confusing because ‘No’ does not make sense as an answer for ‘Do you prefer light or dark chocolate?’\nAvoid nested fieldsets where possible\nFor appointment times the fieldset for morning and afternoon could be removed because each label already says ‘am’ or ‘pm’.\nFor the conditional reveal the nested question could be shown on the next page. This may sound long winded but it usually reduces cognitive load and speeds users up.\n(Note: Some nested fieldsets may be okay. For example, I often use them to reveal a date field with day, month and year inputs after selecting ‘Yes’ to knowing that date. This hasn’t raised issues in accessibility audits.)",

          "description": "I love Behind The Scenes style documentaries of animated films. It’s a niche genre but very fulfilling for me – a dad who watches almost exclusively animated TV and films with my children. Above is a playlist of ~20 short behind-the-scenes documentaries of some of the greatest animated films from some of the greatest animation studios. I rewatch all these from time to time and reference them frequently, so I thought I’d collect them in a playlist and share.\nThe obsession started before kids actually, as part of trying to learning how large creative projects are successful. I get a lot of inspiration from seeing how animated films come together. Animated films that take years to make are incredibly different from the work I do but share some principles that I feel apply to large software projects like websites.\nThere’s tons of gleanable insights from their processes and tools. Processes like “dailies” or a “brain trust” like they talked about in the book Creativity, Inc. seem apt for web development. I often wonder if a Producer/Director-model would be better for websites.\nI have some non-YouTube recommendations as well. I’ve posted some them before, but here’s a running list of documentaries and docu-series I’ve come across:\nBeyond Infinity (2022, Disney+)\nInto the Unknown: Making Frozen 2 (2020, Disney+)\nInside Pixar (2020, Disney+)\nI Know That Voice (2013, Prime Video)\nThe Kingdom of Dreams and Madness (2013, HBO Max)\nWaking Sleeping Beauty (2009, Disney+)\nThe Pixar Story (2007, Disney+)\nFrank and Ollie (1995, Disney+)\nAlways up for more YouTube and feature length documentaries, if you have any you liked send them my way.",

This is probably the biggest issue I’ve seen with design systems. They can lead to a feeling of visually generic sameness instead of a feeling of cohesion across an experience.\nWe’re all subtly influenced by the zeitgeist of the day but —in my experience— a lot of the look and feel of components in a design system get born out of a fear of variable content. On my first big design system project I remember someone telling me, “This component has to be able to exist in any context” and I felt the weight of the universe pressing on my shoulders.

          "description": "The shorthand for embedding an image in Markdown is the following:\n\n![descriptive text goes here](example.jpg)\n\n\nThis works for rendering an image in the same way a skateboard is a minimum viable replacement for car; it rolls, but not fast. To render an image responsibly in modern times you need a handful more properties than src and alt ; namely height, width, loading, and decoding attributes.\n\n<img src=\"example.jpg\" \n     alt=\"descriptive text goes here\" \n     height=\"400\" \n     width=\"300\" \n     decoding=\"async\"\n     loading=\"lazy\">\n\n\nHere’s a quick summary of what those other attributes do and why you should have them:\nheight + width - The HTML spec changed slightly and now setting a height and width draws an aspect-ratio’d box for the image to paints in. This prevents layout shift as the image loads.\ndecoding=\"async\" (Optional) - This prevents the browser from blocking other content and move image decoding  it decodes the image data to a bitmap. I feel like this should be the browser default?\nloading=\"lazy\" (Optional) - Recommended for any image below the fold.\nHonorable mentions\nsrcset + sizes - If you want the fastest images, you can offer different sizes and cuts of your images. I don’t do this and Lighthouse is always mad about it.\nfetchpriority - This is like driving a manual stick shift, but may be useful. I think loading=\"lazy|eager\" are easier to reason about than fetchpriority but I’m not your boss.\nSome Markdown formatters have a custom syntax that supports adding more attributes, like Kramdown…\n\n![descriptive text goes here](example.jpg){: height=\"36px\" width=\"36px\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" }\n\n\nThis makes your Markdown less readable and less portable to other engines. If you’re going to include all these attributes, you might as well use an HTML <img> tag. This will make your images consistent with the other (unsupported without plugins) media like <video>, <audio>, <picture>, and <svg> in your Markdown posts.",

          "description": "I don't even know where to start with this, but the UI/UX of Amazon Music is so incomprehensibly bad it's hard to believe it wasn't put together by first year interns. We're led to believe that FAANG hires the best of the best minds but it's increasingly obvious this can't be the case anymore. A short list of my experiences:\n* Infinite scroll is broken in the desktop browser. I can't access songs in my library beyond the letter A. Why infinite scroll is needed here or anywhere for that matter is an entire discussion unto itself.\n* Random music I've purchased is unavailable for streaming and has been reassigned to \"shuffle with other songs\" as I don't subscribe to unlimited. I can still download the songs and listen to them locally however. To put it another way, some stuff I've purchased looks like I haven't, perhaps in an attempt to get me to repurchase it.\n* Accessing a 30 second sample of a song is hidden behind a mess of dark patterns. Scrolling in this UI is broken as well with overlapping layers hiding text and graphics. In fact the whole purchasing of music has been deliberately obfuscated likely to encourage streaming.\n* Searching for music within your own library is nearly impossible.\nI could go on and on about this but my experiences have been so bad I'm left speechless as to how this made it to production. As a highly experienced technical user I can't help but feel how the average consumer forced to interact with this garbage feels.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36372298\nPoints: 6\n# Comments: 2",

But now with Reddit going dark and people looking for a new place to migrate to, I'm doing a quick launch today.\nA few quick things:\n1. I don't believe federated platforms will ever become mainstream. They have a whole host of problems, not the least of which is that they're too complicated for most people to use. This platform is not, therefore, federated.\n2. I don't know what the best way of monetizing a thing like this is.

          "description": "Hey hacker news\nI'm the founder and lead developer at Opine.cm, and we've just rolled out a new feature that hopefully will reduce the number iterations in your design or web-dev projects.\nI've always been a big fan of checklists. When checklists were introduced to hospitals prior to surgeries, the number of complications and deaths dropped by 35%. I use them a lot personally - but I know many designers and devs find it too much effort.\nThe reality is, we easily forget verbal feedback; the humble to-do list solves this. We've just taken the added step of using AI to turn any video feedback that you get into a to-do list.\nTo try it for yourself\n- Create an account at https://Opine.cm\n- Record some feedback on the design examples\n- Watch as the AI creates your to-do list.\nOr here's a demo\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/e7a6ccd0df0b4dfb8552bd08c7c8ab56\n(Quick note - The demo shows design work - but you can add also add websites in Opine.)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36353445\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hi everyone,\nI'm Joachim, and together with my co-founder, we're building Visoid - a tool for rendering architectural designs in an iterative manner.  We firmly believe that the future of this type of rendering, especially during the ideation stage of a project, will be heavily reliant on generative AI.\nTraditionally, you would send your designs to a professional and potentially wait several days for the renders to be ready, all the while going back and forth with consultations. With Visoid, you can now receive instant, beautiful renders at a fraction of the cost.\nOur platform is designed for architects and rendering professionals who work with visualizations of architectural designs. Visoid enables our users to iteratively modify the scene, materials, and elements in a sketch, 3D model or similar, controlled with a simple prompt.\nWe're still in the early stages, and while the output isn't always perfect, we've made significant strides in improving the quality and the control of the output images. We're confident that it's only a matter of time before we can consistently deliver higher quality images and with even more control.\nWe're still figuring out how to fit this product into the workflow of our users and would love to get your feedback. I will try to answer any questions you have.\nFor more example images, have a look at our Instagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/visoidai/\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36341692\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 2",

I'd love to know the pain points you encounter while working with your chosen UI library. Are there any specific challenges or limitations you've come across that hinder your development process?\n3. What features do you feel are missing from your favorite UI libraries? Are there any particular features or functionalities that you wish your favorite library offered?\n4.

          "description": "Hello, Co-Founder of Fab Ahead here.\nWe are trying a new angle to fight planned obsolescence and other anti-consumer practices by building an open design marketplace that solves the barrier to entry problems of other attempts.\nWe are doing this by:\n• Focusing the platform on physical products that could be substituted for manufactured goods.\n• Integrating parts not eligible for additive manufacturing or similar methods into the ecosystem.\n• Lowering the skill floor to participate by allowing customers the option to order all form molded parts rather than requiring them to 3D print themselves.\n• By lowering the skill floor to allow access to a wider market we can allow product designers to earn a substantial income off royalty style revenue.\nThe link   is a functional mockup in Shopify of how a customer would interact with the platform.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36216753\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

It came up with a design that seems plausible to me (a non-expert), essentially using gyroscopes to induce controllable spin, and uses the Magnus effect to allow the orb to bend through the air like a soccer ball. Wanted to get Hacker New's take on whether this design is possible.\nStructure and Composition: The orb's structure is a sphere composed of strong, lightweight materials akin to those used in modern aircraft or spacecraft. These materials are capable of withstanding the pressures and forces experienced during flight while also minimizing the orb's overall weight.\nBuoyancy: The orb is filled with a lighter-than-air gas su…",

          "description": "I recently needed to check a past transfer to confirm that I was sending some crypto to the same wallet address. In the past, the last few transactions showed up on the \"Pay\" page. They have since renamed \"Pay\" to Transfers or something like that. They no longer show past transactions, so I went down a rabbit hole of searching through the app, couldn't find it, then had to google it and found a help page for Coinbase. There is a link in the article to coinbase.com/reports (I can find no way to get to it from the web app except by following the link from the help article.) Once there, you can select the date ranges you want and generate a transaction report in PDF or CSV and then you have to wait a bit while it generates the report for you to download.\nWhat kind of UI craziness is this? A user's transaction history is such a basic feature, I can't imagine contributing the obfuscation of this history to just incompetence. There must be some dark pattern here. Perhaps the want to hide from user's how much real money they are putting into the system? It seems like a serious security risk anyway. Someone with unauthorized access to an account could easily siphon off crypto and it would be difficult to notice unless you are frequently generating and downloading transaction reports and going through them.\nI am not finding much talk of this. Am I in the minority thinking that this is a mission critical, absolutely bare bones feature that should be front and center of any finance related app?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36179175\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nI am assuming that most Software Engineers don’t get hands on System Design work in their day-to-day job, my questions are:\n1. How to prep for System Design Interviews, given that most resources out there are very superficial in their explanation of what technology to use, when to use it and why to use it?\n2. Will becoming good at prepping for System Design interviews actually help in designing large scale systems better?\n3. If not 2, then how do you become better at designing actual systems?\nI already know that DDIA is a good resource but it does not help you design concrete systems.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36115528\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "I'm curious what methods people here use to avoid distractions when working on a computer. Obviously computers are excellent tools, but simply having access to an internet browser can be a gateway to a massive time sink.\nSome things I have tried:\n- Set up a Pi-Hole with distracting websites on the blacklist so the DNS requests do not resolve. I disabled this to dork around on the web today, so clearly not an effective commitment device.\n- \"Cold Turkey Writer\" which locks down your PC giving only a text box essentially, until you write X words. I didn't find this useful for my writing style since I tend to look up additional references/sources as I write, and losing access to that hurt my flow.\n- Using a Raspberry Pi 4B as my desktop PC, with the idea being I couldn't play games and YouTube isn't entertaining when 30% of the frames are dropping. I ended up wasting a bunch of time messing with Linux trying to get stuff to work (oh Obsidian needs to be compiled and installed for ARM, oh there's no Google Drive installer for Linux, let's set up rclone, oh the audio driver broke). It was cool to have a fanless, low-power PC but I went back to my Windows desktop out of frustration and desire to have things \"just work\".\nIs it futile to use hardware/software to try and fix a self-discipline issue? What works for you?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36346043\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "I’ve been using RSS readers for decades, but they’ve started feeling more and more like a chore. Something about the inbox/to-do list design, counts of unread items, managing teams and complex filtering rules... I realized they add to my stress level instead of reducing it.\nI’ve also come to rely on social media for discovery – hearing about new ideas, tools, papers, people, etc., but I’m so tired of the ads, spam, addictiveness, and toxicity.\nApricot is my attempt to distill the best of both worlds. It’s a web app where users subscribe to feeds like an RSS reader then see new items as they come in, in a single, combined, social media-style feed.\nApricot goes beyond traditional RSS readers in a couple other ways:\n  * Users can follow TV shows (via TVmaze), Spotify podcasts, Substack newsletters, YouTube channels, and Subreddits (if/when they come back online) in addition to traditional RSS feeds. I’m open to adding other platforms if there’s demand and the content is programmatically accessible.\n\n  * Cross-platform feed search. I know search isn’t hot at the moment but it’s pretty useful in this context. Search for “Star Trek” and find not just the TV shows, but the podcasts and Subreddits too.\n\n  * Items can be sorted chronologically or with an ML-powered recommender system.\n\n  * Users can filter their feed by platform, which is helpful for specific use cases like finding a good podcast episode for a car ride or a good TV episode to watch after dinner.\n\n  * On-demand, GPT-powered content summaries help users see what an article is really about before clicking. (gotta sprinkle some gen AI on there!)\n\nIf you’ve got a few minutes (and come on, with Reddit offline, I know you do), check it out and let me know what you think!\nApp: https://app.theapricot.io\nHomepage: https://theapricot.io\nBlog: https://blog.theapricot.io\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36314857\nPoints: 11\n# Comments: 17",

          "description": "Am I the only one using Thunderbird strictly as an RSS client? I've seen countless RSS clients recommended here over the years but none ever have the features to make me switch, mainly due to lacking extension support (for things like uBlock Origin and Bypass Paywalls) or privacy concerns from not running on a local Linux desktop. (I haven't heavily used the e-mail functionality in Thunderbird in over two decades. I haven't tried the Chat or any other functionality at all.)\nIs there something I'm missing out on? Is there a client with all the same features and then some that I just haven't found yet? I've looked at Feedly, Inoreader, and many others through the years but none have risen to the level of replacement. It's not broken so I'm not looking to fix it but I'm open to hearing how others manage their feeds to see if there's any possible improvements I've overlooked.\nFull disclosure: I've donated in the past to Thunderbird/Mozilla, including company matches.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36256681\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

I am a chronic procrastinator and have tried everything to be more productive like lists, calendars, apps, etc. but I still can't seem to get things done. I want to study more, read more, and finish my coding projects. However, I end up not doing much and feel terribly guilty. I suspect I may have ADHD or some kind of dopamine addiction but I'm not sure. I do well in school even by studying at the last minute, and I attend a rather challenging school. In my free time though, I end up doing very little or nothing, not knowing where my time went. I try to remove all distractions but it doesn't seem to work.\nDoes anyone have any advice or strategies on how I can improve my productivity and focus? How have you overcome similar challenges to achieve your goals and stay focused?

          "description": "I've been thinking a lot recently about how technology, particularly AI, can play a role in personal productivity. One concept that's caught my attention is the idea of an 'AI conversation companion' for tracking thoughts, ideas, and progress in various areas of life. Imagine having an AI that you can converse with on a regular basis, where it asks you thoughtful questions about topics you're interested in or working on. Over time, it adapts its questions based on your responses and generates summaries, which can be reviewed and reflected upon at any time.\nSuch an AI companion could act as a kind of automated journal or diary, providing a space for reflection and self-improvement, but with the added benefits of interactivity and adaptability. It could also serve as an accountability tool, reminding you of your goals and progress, and prompting regular reflection.\nWhat do you all think about the potential of using AI to aid productivity? Have you used any similar tools or services? What methods do you use today to prep helping future AI companions understand your life/goals?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36129315\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

The main differentiator is that Yakread uses machine learning to rank the articles in your feed: as you click on articles from a particular RSS/newsletter subscription, other articles from that subscription will tend to be ranked higher in the future (via a bandit algorithm). Yakread also uses ML to recommend articles that other users have read, so your feed will have articles in it even before you sign up and add your own subscriptions.\nFor the recommendations, I'm using the collaborative filtering implementation from Spark MLlib[1]. I model RSS feeds instead of individual articles: when you click an article, that counts as a \"point\" for that article's RSS feed; at recommendation time, the algorithm first selects an RSS fe…",

          "description": "Hi,\nI really like HN and the simplicity of everything (from create/login workflow to submit links). Everything is fast, straight to the point, and clean/simple HTML.\nI've just a really minor complaint: on wide screen, reading comments is really painful (for me at least, I maximise all my windows...). It's not the size of the font, it's really the width of lines on wide screen. I've the impression that we're a lot of developers on HN, with huge screens, and the wide screens experience could be better in \"vanilla\" HN.\nI sometimes open a link in HackerWeb (for instance https://hackerweb.app/#/item/36238342) just to have a better reading experience...\nEvery thing else: don't change, it's perfect!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36238841\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Through the little Etsy store I've got, I offer Game Boy game repair mostly just so I get to \"play\" on different problems, and a different problem did arrive.\nThis Game Boy Advance game, although worked, requires a battery for the real time clock aspects of the game (i.e. timed events). The problem was that there was a repair attempt that had taken off the entire pad for the battery, and in fact had go through the pad, through the silk screen and had gone all the way into the fibre glass insulation layer (you might be able to see in the photo the woven pattern).\nBefore slapping a battery on and jumping the positive leg to the right component, I wanted to check that nothing else was missing. Thankfully the community have tried to preserve a lot of the history (in this case, the PCB traces) but also published it freely on the web.\nFrom this I also found a resistor had been lost in the previous repair. I don't think it's clear from my photo, but what I did was to bond the missing resistor in a completely different location (before it traces to a capacitor) and then use a jumper wire from the replaceable battery case. This was mostly in case the battery case was torn off again it wouldn't cause damage to the components on the board.\nOnce that was all done, the game happily had its clock and was returned to it's owner the same day.",

From my experience with Pokémon Mini handhelds, I was wondering if perhaps the power button wasn't getting the signal.\nSo I applied a slice of kitchen tin foil, some sticky tape and voilà, it powers up! I had to also apply it to the sound and start button (and I'll probably make this permanent with conductive paint one day), but otherwise it's all good.\n(And I snagged a flash cart so I was able to experience some translated romhacks too)",
