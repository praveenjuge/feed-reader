          "description": "I’m a fan of logical properties in CSS. As I wrote in the responsive design course on web.dev, they’re crucial for internationalisation.\nAlaa Abd El-Rahim has written articles on CSS tricks about building multi-directional layouts and controlling layout in a multi-directional website. Not having to write separate stylesheets—or even separate rules—for different writing modes is great!\nMore than that though, I think understanding logical properties is the best way to truly understand CSS layout tools like grid and flexbox.\nIt’s like when you’re learning a new language. At some point your brain goes from translating from your mother tongue into the other language, and instead starts thinking in that other language. Likewise with CSS, as some point you want to stop translating “left” and “rig…",

It’s from the HTML design principles. The priority of constituencies:\nIn case of conflict, consider users over authors over implementors over specifiers over theoretical purity.\nIt’s all about priorities, see?\nPrioritisation isn’t easy, and it gets harder the more factors come into play: user needs, business needs, technical constraints. But it’s worth investing the time to get agreement on the priority of your constituencies.

There was a line that really stood out to me:\nThe idea that it’s alright to do whatever unethical thing is currently the industry norm is widespread in tech, and dangerous.\nIt stood out to me because I had been thinking about certain practices that are widespread, accepted, and yet strike me as deeply problematic. These practices involve tracking users.\nThe first problem is that even the terminology I’m using would be rejected. When you track users on your website, it’s called analytics. Or maybe it’s stats. If you track users on a large enough scale, I guess you get to just call it data.\nThose words—“analytics”, “stats”, and “data”—are often used when the more accurate word would be “tracking.”\nOr to put it another way; …",

Actually, for a while there, I was working just two days a week while we took a “wait and see” attitude at Clearleft to see how The Situation was going to affect work. We weathered that storm, but rather than going back to a full five-day week I decided to try switching to four days instead.\nThis meant taking a pay cut. Time is literally money when it comes to work. But I decided it was worth it. That’s a privileged position to be in, I know. I managed to pay off the mortgage on our home last year so that reduced some financial pressure. But I also turned fifty, which made me think that I should really be padding some kind of theoretical nest egg. Still, the opportunity to reduce working hours looked good to me.\nThe ideal situ…",

          "description": "I just finished watching The Billion Dollar Code, a German languge miniseries on Netflix. It’s no Halt and Catch Fire, but it combines ’90s nostalgia, early web tech, and an opportunity for me to exercise my German comprehension.\nIt’s based on a true story, but with amalgamated characters. The plot, which centres around the preparation for a court case, inevitably invites comparison to The Social Network, although this time the viewpoint is from that of the underdogs trying to take on the incumbent. The incumbent is Google. The underdogs are ART+COM, artist-hackers who created the technology later used by Google Earth.\nEarly on, one of the characters says something about creating a one-to-one model of the whole world. That phrase struck me as familiar…\nI remember being at the inaugural Future Of Web Apps conference  in London back in 2006. Discussing the talks with friends afterwards, we all got a kick out of the speaker from Google, who happened to be German. His content and delivery was like a wonderfully Stranglovesque mad scientist. I’m sure I remember him saying something like “vee made a vun-to-vun model of the vurld.”\nHis name was Steffen Meschkat.  I liveblogged the talk at the time. Turns out he was indeed on the team at ART+COM when they created Terravision, the technology later appropriated by Google (he ended up working at Google, which doesn’t make for as exciting a story as the TV show).\nHis 2006 talk was all about Ajax, something he was very familiar with, being on the Google Maps team. The Internet Archive even has a copy of the original audio!\nIt’s easy to forget now just how much hype there was around Ajax back then.  It prompted me to write a book about combining Ajax and progressive enhancement.\nThese days, no one talks about Ajax. But that’s not because the technology went away. Quite the opposite. The technology became so ubiquituous that it no longer even needs a label.\nA web developer today might ask “what’s Ajax?” in the same way that a fish might ask “what’s water?”",

The opening keynote had its usual share of announcements.\nThere was quite a bit of talk about privacy, which sounds good in theory, but then we were told that Google would be partnering with “industry stakeholders.” That’s probably code for the kind of ad-tech sharks that have been making a concerted effort to infest W3C groups. Beware.\nBut once Una was on-screen, the topics shifted to the kind of design and development updates that don’t have sinister overtones.\nMy favourite moment was when Una said:\nWe’re also partnering with Jeremy Keith of Clearleft to launch Learn Responsive Design on web.dev.

          "description": "Back in April I gave a talk at An Event Apart Spring Summit. The talk was called The State Of The Web, and I’ve published the transcript. I’ve also published the video.\nI put a lot of work into this talk and I think it paid off. I wrote about preparing the talk. I also wrote about recording it. I also published links related to the talk. It was an intense process, but a rewarding one.\nI almost called the talk The Overview Effect. My main goal with the talk was to instil a sense of perspective. Hence the references to the famous Earthrise photograph.\nOn the one hand, I wanted the audience to grasp just how far the web has come. So the first half of the talk is a bit of a trip down memory lane, with a constant return to just how much we can accomplish in browsers today. It’s all very positive and upbeat.\nThen I twist the knife. Having shown just how far we’ve progressed technically, I switch gears the moment I say:\nThe biggest challenges facing the World Wide Web today are not technical challenges.\nThen I dive into those challenges, as I see them. It turns out that technical challenges would be preferable to the seemingly intractable problems of today’s web.\nI almost wish I could’ve flipped the order: talk about the negative stuff first but then finish with the positive. I worry that the talk could be a bit of a downer. Still, I tried to finish on an optimistic note.\nI won’t spoil it any more for you. Watch the video or have a read of The State Of The Web.",

It was also four days of ever-increasing risk assessment.\nIt began on Thursday morning with the first Salter Cane band practice in eighteen months. That was pretty safe—three of us in a room, reminding ourselves of how the songs go. I honestly thought it could’ve been a disaster and that I wouldn’t remember anything, but thanks to a little bit of last-minute revision the evening before, it actually went really well. And boy, did it feel good to plug in and play those songs again.\nLater that day, Jessica went up to London. We spent that evening in the Royal Opera House, watching a ballet, The Dante Project. We wore masks. Not everyone else did.\n\n\n\nThe next day, the indoor gatherings continued. We went to the …",

There are dozens of new computer related icons for parts, ports, and peripheral devices. There are also several new brand icons, including Meta, and some other fun icons like a new robot head and a boombox.\nLooking for more new icons? Head to the issue tracker to check for open requests or submit a new one.\nInstall\nTo get started, install or update via npm:\nnpm i bootstrap-icons\n\n\nOr Composer:\ncomposer require twbs/bootstrap-icons\n\n\nYou can also download the release from GitHub, or download just the SVGs and fonts (without the rest of the repository files).\nFigma\nThe Figma file is now published to the Figma Community! It’s the same Bootstrap Icons Figma file you’ve seen from previous releases, just a little more accessible to those using the app.",

It’s made it an unenjoyable place for me as more and more people I follow chase the money over to Web3. Everything is getting an NFT feature: Twitter, Discord, Reddit, Disney+, Star Trek; it’s exhausting.\nI spent a lot of time and emotional well-being last month thinking (aka “doing my own research”) about Web3 and NFTs. I’m not morally opposed to ledger-like problems that blockchain can solve and DAOs even sound great; but the surface area for criminal activity, unregulated markets, no consumer protection, fake scarcity to drive up values, low-quality art being cheaply made selling at inflated values, thousands of 500 watt GPUs glowing in a basement in Iowa destroying the environment for a profile picture… Ugh.\nNFTs are sucking the air out of everything… both literally and figuratively.\nTwo weeks ago I uninstalled Twitter from my devices. Waking up in the morning I’m no longer greeted with a million angry voices. No faux conservative outrage, no reactive liberal outrage. It can all be undone in an instant, but right now I’m unplugged from the infernal machine and it feels unsettingly quiet.",

It will apply to both the User-Agent request header and the Javascript\nAPIs (for example, navigator.userAgent).\nSimilar experiments\nare being run on Firefox as well.\nVisit\nIs Chrome 100 yet? to\ncheck if your browser is sending the major version 100 in the User-Agent\nstring.\nTo turn the flag on in Chrome and experiment, type chrome://flags in the address bar and enable\nthe #force-major-version-to-100 flag.\nVisiting\nIs Chrome 100 yet?\nafter enabling the flag reports that the User-Agent has major version number 100.\nThe goal is to uncover as many issues as possible ahead of time, so send your\nbug reports to\nWeb Compat\nand help prepare the web for three-digit major browser version numbers!",

          "description": "Ok so the high level breakdown:\n1. Read and do the problems for the first half of the book. Do not rush this part of the process.\n2. Skip the second half of the book when the chapters switch to being real world examples\n3. Having trouble on a particular section? Watch the youtube video to get a cleaner read: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22hwcnXIGgk&list=PLOtl7M3yp-DX6ic0HGT0PUX_wiNmkWkXx\n4. Don't spend too much time on NP/NP-Complete/NP-Hard topics\n5. Over learn chapter 2. This is arguably the most important chapter having a deep understanding of runtime analysis helps you in every other chapter and on the interview\n6. Don't spend too much time on writing proofs in Chapter 1. Understand them and be able to work through them and understand how the math comes together, but writing a specific proof isn't too valuable. \n7. Sometimes the interview problems at the end of the chapter are silly. If it feels dumb, example: 1.36. How much does the ice in a hockey rink weigh? Skip it. These are older school programming interview questions and have been largely phased out\nUltimately I feel like this book is the best resource for big tech interview prep, and I want to help my students spend their time as efficiently as possible. If anyone has additional advice or feedback on how I can improve this list, I'd love to hear it.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29369624\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 1",

I found myself not wanting things too wild or different from what we have today - just incremental improvements. Is that objectively true? What, if anything, is the next leap forward? Or are we close to them being \"good enough\" for the most part?\nMy top \"problems\", in some shape or form, from existing products:\n- Be faster to complete builds\n- Have fewer false positives (or do accurate self-healing magic)\n- Be easier to get started with (or be optionally codeless like Selenium IDE)\n- Don't be a walled garden (what if I want to run the same logical 'test' across Playwright and Cypress)\n- Help me write better tests (or be difficult to write bad tests within)\n- Emulate mobile devices better than just viewport modification\nWhat do the HN folks think?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29329713\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Roughly once a week, HN will feature a link to a new web-based UI framework/toolkit. These seem to build upon a history that, briefly stated, seems to go: HTML -> HTML5 -> JS -> Node -> React -> [ a lot of stuff ]. Obviously there are things that branched off at various points along the way.\nAs a purely native desktop application developer, whenever I read about these frameworks, they seem to contain almost no trace of any of the programming models/designs/lessons that were learned between (say) 1980 and 2005 in the domain of native GUI toolkits (both platform-specific and cross-platform). There's almost no trace of any of the vocabulary, but also very little sign of any of the fundamental concepts (widgets, \"classic\" MVC, etc.)\nSo I'm asking without (much) predjudice: what's so different about UI/UX in web-dev that justifies throwing away all these design lessons? Or are they really still in modern web frameworks and I'm just not seeing them?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29313055\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I'm really confused on this. My understanding on Golang's intentions and design is that it is an intentionally simple language lacking most of traditional OO features. The language is relying on interfaces (and Generics?) for doing most of the things you'd do with classic OO.\nYet I see job ads requiring and even classes teaching Design Pattterns with Golang. And by inquiry I see that they're not talking about Golang-specific DPs (that would make sense) but about fitting traditional OO DPs (and principles like SOLID) to Golang. Which in turn seems to me like bending the language to something it was not designed for in order to fit into models we developed for traditional OO languages like java and C++.\nUnsure what is going on here and what the consensus on best practice is (if any).\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29078533\nPoints: 12\n# Comments: 6",

          "description": "Are there any, or can we maybe come up with (i.e. suggestions please if it seems like a good idea), HTTP headers that browsers can send to sites that automatically instruct them in terms of:\n1. The kinds of cookies I'm willing to accept (e.g. strictly necessary). For example, `X-Prefer-Cookies: strictly-necessary` or `X-Prefer-Cookies: all`.\n2. The fact that I don't, and probably never will, care about your newsletter. (If your content really interests me, I'll find a way through your UI to subscribe.) For example: `X-Offer-Newsletter: no`, or `X-Offer-Newsletter: yes`.\nIf you wanted to facilitate more general UX preference indications from the client side, you could potentially come up with a scheme like `X-UX-Preferences: strictly-necessary-cookies; no-newsletters`.\nThis way I can set these preferences once in my browser and be done with your annoying cookie selection and newsletter popups (if your site honours those headers, of course).\nI think that, if most websites honoured those headers, it might just fix 80% of what I personally feel is wrong with the modern web. (The other 20% I think involves completely eradicating online advertising-driven business models from the face of the planet, which I think is quite a bit harder to achieve than this.)\nEDIT: grammar\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29052246\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 0",

I don't have much web dev experience though (mostly vanilla JS) but do have lots of mobile dev and backend dev experience in node js and bit of Rust.\nHave you switched from native to cross platform dev?\nHave you tried both flutter and react native?\nWhich one did you prefer and why?\nThanks!\nEdit: I did start learning flutter yesterday and it seems pretty decent so far. 2 problems I do have are:\n1. Too must nesting (which some say can be solved by breaking down everything into smaller widgets but seems like a lot of extra code work).\n2. Flutter for web dev is absolute trash and useless as it seems to just draw the content using canvas instead of actually creating the html tree.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29357432\nPoints: 15\n# Comments: 8",

Whilst I'm here in the real world, my blog will exist in the digital world, and every single post URL will work (404s are for the weak! 😏).\nBack in 2015 I set myself an goal to publish at least two posts a month, for the most part I've managed. I've always been a fan of \"easy goals\" - something that's achievable without it causing stress - so doing some writing twice a month definitely hit that sweet spot.\nThis particular blog has been active since 2006, but I had also toyed with more diary-like sites during the early-2000s but the URLs are so obscure not only has the web forgotten, but they're wiped clean from my own memory.\nWhen I starte…",

I mean that in a good way! I think Web3 has resonated powerfully with young people because it feels like something genuinely new, and it feels like it can be theirs. Who could argue with those feelings? Not me.\n\nThe notes go on and I come away with the same general sense that I've had so far of the crowd cheering on for Web3: it's about making money. Which is fine, the world runs on capitalism for the most part, it's just not entirely for me.\nAnd I think that's the rub, the stories I know of the creation and the spread of the web (and indeed the internet) came from those wanting to share and do good. The stories I've read were never about making money but instead creating a place for others.\nI will concede that I don't tend to read the \"got rich by selling X web start up\" - but it's that start in the web that's what drives me, and what I love about the web. It's what I love about the Open Web.\nWeb Zero if you will. It was about sharing, community, learning and finding a place in the world.\nSource: society.robinsloan.com",

However, sample efficiency remains a key challenge, with prominent methods requiring millions (or even billions) of environment steps to train. Recently, there has been significant progress in sample efficient image-based RL algorithms; however, consistent human-level performance on the Atari game benchmark remains an elusive goal.\nWe propose a sample efficient model-based visual RL algorithm built on MuZero, which we name EfficientZero. Our method achieves 190.4% mean human performance and 116.0% median performance on the Atari 100k benchmark with only two hours of real-time game experience and outperforms the state SAC in some tasks on the DMControl 100k benchmark. This is the first time an algorithm achieves super-human performance on Atari games with such little data. EfficientZero's performance is also close to DQN's performance at 200 million frames while we consume 500 times less data.\nEfficientZero's low sample complexity and high performance can bring RL closer to real-world applicability. We implement our algorithm in an easy-to-understand manner and it is available at this https URL. We hope it will accelerate the research of MCTS-based RL algorithms in the wider community.\nThis work is supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People’s Republic of China, the 2030 Innovation Megaprojects “Program on New Generation Artificial Intelligence” (Grant No. 2021AAA0150000).\nSome have said that poor sample-efficiency on ALE has been a reason to downplay DRL progress or implications. The primary boost in EfficientZero (table 3), pushing it past the human benchmark, is some simple self-supervised learning (SimSiam on predicted vs actual observations).\nDiscuss",

The mindset we have first thing in the morning is likely to be carried with us throughout the day. Unless we put forth a major amount of effort to change, which is incredibly hard as anyone who has been in the depths of a bad mood knows. \n\n\nUnderstanding how important our mood is in the morning can either be empowering or terrifying depending on your perspective. \n\n\nIf you hold onto the idea that you cannot control your emotions and the mood you’re in, then you’ll be waking up each day in hopes that today will be …",

But the truth is, it takes just a bit of effort in a few specific areas.\n\n\nHere’s the deal: I know it’s not easy to be confident at all times. I've been there. And I've made it to the other side.\n\n\nThe good news about confidence is that it can be learned. Yes, I had to do some work. But with practice, you can actually become a master at it.\n\n\nYou must be wondering, what are the steps? How does one gain confidence if they don’t have any of it built-in yet? \n\n\nEspecially for some personality types (MBTI or Big Five factors), the effort you need to reach full confidence will vary.

No matter where we’re going or what we’re doing, we allow our minds to run rampant and never stop. Recent research shows that humans tally more than 6,000 thoughts each day. Those thousands of thoughts are an irrefutable consequence of our society’s obsessive need to be busy and distracted. \n\n\nYet if we don’t stop, even occasionally, from our obsessive mental planning, rehashing and cataloguing, we become disconnected and removed from a source greater than us. Instead of busily looking for answers outside of ourselves, and relying on distractions, stimulants, materialism and other external influences that we believe will give us meaning, we all have the ability to become more awa…",

          "description": "In the course of designing user interfaces, and processing feedback about designs, one sometimes runs into a \"That's distracting\" comment about something specific in the design. You may even say it — or feel it — about something you're designing.\n\nWhat's distracting about it? Maybe something's too colorful. Maybe it's something regarding the layout. Maybe it's the ordering of elements, or the size or proportion of something related to something else. Maybe it's a specific animation. Maybe it's even a sound generated by a specific action, button press, or gesture.\nSo what do you do? You look, you consider. But when you're staring at the thing that prompted the feedback, it's common to narrow your focus until only the  offending element is in view. Essentially, when someone says \"it's this t…",

          "description": "This is the tenth post in a new series I'm calling Heard Something, Read Something, Saw Something. I'll post these periodically whenever I can fill up three slots — one for something interesting I recently listened to, one for something I read that I liked, and one for something I saw that caught my eye. Hope you enjoy these.\n—\nHeard Something\nReally enjoyed this conversation between Lex Fridman and Steve Viscelli. Steve is an economic sociologist who embedded as a long haul trucker for 6 months to go through the training, learn the ropes, get to know the people, absorb the stories, and understand the business — and the job — of trucking in America. It's a 3 hour conversation, and it's worth it.\nHear it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3Wpy6gE4So\nRead Something\nPeople often ask me if I know any good books on writing. One of my favorites is \"Revising Prose\" by Richard Lanham, but I may have a new favorite. It's called \"Several short sentences about writing\" by Verlyn Klinkenborg. It's all about the sentence, and it's written one sentence at a time, rather than in traditional paragraphs. It's smart, and it gets to creamy center of what makes certain writing so delicious.\nRead it: https://bookshop.org/books/several-short-sentences-about-writing/9780307279415\nSaw Something\nWe've all seen the periodic table, but do you know where each element originated? Here's Jennifer Johnson's novel take on the table that shows you where everything came from.\nSee it: http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~jaj/nucleo/\n  \n      \n        \n\n  \nUntil next time.\n\n\n-Jason",

          "description": "Designing products is one of my favorite things to do — period.\nThere's a lot to love. The twists and turns, the surprises, the creative explorations, the collaboration, and the moments when things really come together.\nBut it's the practical choices, the tough decisions, and the tradeoffs that really make the work challenging and interesting. I'm long for that kind of work.\nWhen building products you're occasionally reminded of a peculiar — somewhat magical — irony: That reducing options can create more optionality. And that you can actually do less work and get more out of it.\nCase in point. We're currently working on adding autoresponders to HEY. Since these are frequently used by people who are going out of town, we began the flow with specifying a start and end date. If anyone emails …",
