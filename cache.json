We can check whether a browser supports aspect-ratio, say, and provide a fallback in cases where lack of support would hamper the user experience.\n.some-element {\n  max-height: 200px;\n}\n@supports (aspect-ratio: 1) {\n  .some-element {\n    aspect-ratio: 1;\n    max-height: none;\n  }\n}\nThis particular block of code sets a max-height on an element, except when aspect-ratio is supported, when we’ll use that instead.\nWe could make this a bit more concis…",

Kids are going back to school and I’ve found myself stepping back from some commitments.\nRunning out of spoons\nThis month I ran out of spoons. Neck-deep into starting a company and feeling that ambient stress, I realized I’m running out of available bandwidth. This manifests in tiredness, grumpiness, back pain, etc. I made the tough decision to step back from some extracurricular activities: a podcast, Open UI, my DnD group, and a handful of other obligations.\nA lot of it comes down to something I mentioned in my post about PARA, the idea that projects have an end date.

I never felt attracted to these tools even though thousands of developers had success with them. I’m not sure why I never jumped in, but I’m sure verbosity and/or tooling fatigue played a part. Ultimately, I ended up settling on my own SMACSS/BEM hybrid that’s more of a .block--variant .generic {}  pattern with some global utilities mixed in.\nI’m not anti-BEM nor anti-roboclasses, but as we enter a new era for CSS I think we have an opportunity to rethink best practices aro…",

          "description": "A few weeks ago I bought a one month Disney+ subscription to check it out. I have all kinds of problems when using their web player compared to Netflix and YouTube:\n- subtitle settings get reset every time I close the website.\n- the button for changing subtitles is in the upper right corner. Once you open the menu the button for closing it appears in the upper left corner. You can't close the menu by clicking outside of it, despite the fact that you can still see the blurred video in the background.\n- pressing space doesn't pause the video, but repeats the last action you did. If you closed the subtitle menu by pressing esc, pressing space will open it again. If you entered the full screen mode, pressing space will close it.\n- there is no way (afaik) to open a list of all episodes from within the player. You have to go back to the show's main page, choose the season (because it always defaults to season 1) and scroll a horizontal list (which always defaults to the first episode) using a button that appears only once you hover it. Scrolling with a mouse scroll/touchpad doesn't work.\n- it is impossible to search for movies using a director's name. For example, I know that Disney+ has a lot of Charlie Kaufman's and Wes Anderson's movies available - they are my favorite directors - but I couldn't quickly check which specific movies there are.\nI know that it's possible that I have higher standards of UX because I'm a programmer, but I doubt that Disney+'s interface is intuitive to anyone.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32837397\nPoints: 43\n# Comments: 89",

          "description": "I recently purchased an old iPhone 11 Pro Max to try out, after being an Android user the last 12yrs, last phone being the Oneplus 7. I knew there would be big differences and I tried to be as accepting as possible along the way.\nIt's been a few weeks now and I would really like to hear from current or former iPhone users on their thoughts about iOS's maneuverability.\nMy thoughts:\nThe iOS UI thrives on having the user perform tedious steps to perform very simple actions [1], is difficult to use in one hand (I understand there are smaller models but I wanted a bigger battery, this should not excuse the lack of maneuverability), and THERE IS NO UNIVERSAL BACK BUTTON! When you need to go back, you have to figure out how the current app wants you to go backwards. Swipe from the left edge? anywhere on screen? or exit using the button at the top of the screen? It's a guessing game every time.\nI really want to like this phone, the hardware is incredible and the software support for years is terrific. Could long time users please chime in on how they got used to it?\n[1] Reaching to the top right corner to drag down the Control Panel. Having to press the 'Select' button in Photos instead of long pressing a photo. Having to tap a toggle icon exactly for it to change status.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32832474\nPoints: 13\n# Comments: 29",

          "description": "Disclaimer: Thought Experiment. Does not need to be \"practical\". Let your NIH flow and your imagination run wild\nWe've learned a lot about computers in the decades we've been producing. A lot of software assumes that computers work a certain way. See Go lang and how it handles file permissions. In the Linux Kernel drivers exist that supports the IBM 3270 Display System which at this point is over 50 years old. Terminal Emulators mimic the VT100. All of this makes sense given the context in which they were developed and created. But if you were developing an OS in 2022 without these constraints what would you remove and or change? Would you keep 32bit support? Arm, Risc and or x86?, monolithic or microkernel?, C, Rust, Zig, D, C++, or something else?, how would it talk to hardware?, what would your executable format look like?\nAlso if anyone has any interesting links to cutting edge research into Modern Operating Systems I'd love to browse them!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32813072\nPoints: 31\n# Comments: 26",

          "description": "Hey HN,\nI made this free browser extension that modernizes the Hacker News design.\nI previously launched Modern for Wikipedia [1] here back in December, and it seemed like the obvious next choice to build one for HN too!  So I've taken what I learned from building that, and have spent all my spare time this year building Modern for HN.\nI realize this won't be for everyone, but it was a fun project to work on, and I'm really happy with the result so far. Hope you like it too!\nLots more planned for future updates, and suggestions welcome :)\n[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29461735\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32768590\nPoints: 222\n# Comments: 142",

          "description": "I have only had around 2 YoE as a backend developer, but I already have a deep interest in system design.\nThat said, I have realistic expectations in that becoming a software architect requires field experience with different systems, patterns, making mistakes and learning some lessons the hard way.\nNonetheless, I already started learning at least the theoretical foundations thanks to:\n* Designing Data-Intensive Applications\n* System Design Primer\n* Web Scalability for Startup Engineers\n* System Design Interview by Alex Xu\n* Quastor subscription\n* Infoq talks, etc.\nMy interest is only increasing, and I try to participate as much as possible in architecture-related discussions at work with the more experienced developers.\nThanks to the learning resources, it's no longer a problem to understand the theory, but due to lack of experience, I understandably feel anxious and unconfident thinking about designing something myself.\nLet me make it clear, I understand that with that little experience under the belt, you can't suddenly become a software architect after having read a book.\nHowever, some day everyone should start. It would be really cool to find out how currently experienced software architects started their path, designed their first systems, what they would recommend to optimize and fasten the learning process.\nThanks!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32753619\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nLong story short - I'm looking around to see if there are any job boards that would be focused on finding UX people.\nMy friend has a degree in architecture, she was working for quite a few years in variety of building design shops. At some point in her life she moved to suburbs and had children, took a few years off to care for them. Now kids are in school and she is looking to go back to work life, she is craving for interaction with people. She decided to pivot her career and do UX since it is something she is familiar with from her previous jobs, the reason for doing this is that where she lives it would take her roughly 2 hours driving to get to the city and her previous industry is not very remote-friendly.\nShe is trying to get hired as junior UX, however with no success. It had been a couple of months now and she is reaching the point of being depressed for being rejected from every place shy is applying to. I have no experience with UX to give her advice on making her first steps.\nI know it's probably not the best time for juniors but life likes to write scenarios with no regard to economic situation... so any advice would be highly appreciated :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32694898\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I've been building products for many years and, most of the time, my \"admin UI\" would be some SQL GUI (currently Adminer with a custom plugin).\nThat's what I'd use to resolve support cases, change some data for the customers when it's absent from the real UI, etc.\nUsually, there's just no time to build internal admin apps when you're a solo founder or a small team.\nHowever, I'm not really happy with this way of doing things. There's no \"global search\", no place to attach notes, and often it's hard to jump to related records (e.g. client -> client's transactions) quickly.\nAs I'd run the SQL GUI locally, it's always hard to share links to some records with my team, other than in the form of screenshots.\nThe list of problems goes on and on.\n-----\nHence it prompted this question. What do you use? How do you debug data issues? How do you help customers? How do you share links (whatever form they take) to data with your team and collaborate?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32687949\nPoints: 6\n# Comments: 9",

It needs to pull calendar data or images from an API and render it so that customers always sees a latest monthly calendar.\nI once thought of contacting one of those manufacturer of the Photo Frames and ask them if they can do the necessary tweaks. But I'm not sure what details to give them.\nWhat is the prep work necessary for this? I've absolutely no idea where to start but it's one of the project ideas that I come back to again and again and want to get it done no matter what.\nWhere do I even start at this? Any pointers would help tremendously.\nThanks HN.\n[1] https://dakboard.com/site\n[2] https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Picture-Storage-Auto-Rotate-Remotely/dp/B09GF3HYM8\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32661398\nPoints: 7\n# Comments: 2",

Visio is a general-purpose diagram-drawing application, so it cannot do that, but it has always supported linking and embedding, so in theory it could be used for this purpose by a specialized software design tool.

          "description": "Hey HN, 10 years after the project began we have updated the UI for the cloud server comparison site known as EC2Instances.info. This refresh brings a sticky filter bar so you can scroll and see what filters are applied, a more compact navbar, and improved UX for comparing instances.\nI've also fixed numerous long standing UI bugs including: comparisons now load correctly on RDS and ElastiCache, sort by max ENI works, sort by RDS instance storage works, and all dropdowns have consistent behavior.\nFor maintainers and contributors, all the frontend libraries are upgraded to their latest versions, https://github.com/vantage-sh/ec2instances.info. Going forward, we are aware that the homepage size is quite large and have plans to address this.\nWe have tried to be good stewards of this project and evolve it carefully.

          "description": "Hey there..\nI have started writing a book on software design/architecture that provides a different perspective than existing books out there. The thesis of the book is that \"code is for humans\". The book explains how to write code that is optimal for our primitive monkey brains. The book describes how many of the best practices in software stem from deficiencies in our cognitive abilities. It expands on best practices such as (DRY, SSOT, etc) and brings new ideas on what is good code and how to write it.\nI am looking for someone to partner with on this book as it's a huge project and I would love to be able to split the work.\nI have written a rough outline and filled in about 40 pages of notes, examples and text. The project is still very much in it's infancy.\nA bit about me: I worked as the software architect of a 100+ person team at Mobileye/Intel and have many, many years of experience working on a variety of software from self driving cars to web apps.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32562332\nPoints: 26\n# Comments: 18",

          "description": "By seriously I mean both the theory and the practical. The theory of how to actually design and analyse algorithms. And also implement them in a language. The language shouldn't matter while thinking about algorithms.\nAt the moment I am not opting for something like leetcode. I want something that teach me the principles of how to actually design from the fundamentals.\nAlso I want to be as much language agnostic as possible. By that I mean the ability to think about algorithmic solutions to problems in terms of mental models that I can then translate to a low level language like C, or a dynamic imperative language like Python, or a functional language like Racket, SML or OCaml. Of course, the assumption here is that I must know the language I want to implement the algorithm in. So basically I want to learn about algorithms in a paradigm agnostic way so that I can implement them in any paradigm I want.\nHow to go about this? Do you have any book or course suggestions in mind?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32540102\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 3",

          "description": "I might be too 'junior' to grok what goes behind the curtains. When I did a quick survey amongst my software friends, all of their workplaces have been pushing for bringing people back in offices. Some are a bit soft and coy about it (\"From November, we will allow you to choose WFH for half the week!\"), And some are straightforward \"you have to\".\nIn my workplace, the management itself reported high remote productivity. Despite this, we will be asked to work remotely only half the time. They even have a big new building in city center location.\nIs it simply something cynical, e.g. Trying to hold on to prime real estate, or somplyyabout control? Or is there indeed legitimate net benefit to working in offices?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32741902\nPoints: 14\n# Comments: 22",

          "description": "Hello HN !\nI'm the founder of https://symfoz.com which is basically a RSS aggregator that allows people to partition the content they want to see in dedicated spaces called \"Playlists\", thus reducing the time needed to find the information they need.\nWhy Symfoz instead of other RSS aggregators ?\n- Create playlists of content, avoid mixing too many feeds in the same place. You know where everything is.\n- Follow people or playlists, people can create some playlists with AWESOME content, you may benefit from it.\n- We handle classic RSS feeds, but also Youtube channels, Twitter feeds, Spotify Podcasts, sub-reddits.\n- An easy UI interface (This is still WIP, UI is very hard haha)\n- Promote retention of information by allowing people to take notes (not highlighting but really take notes), instead of just consuming content and forget it. You'll be able to find your notes easily.\nA bit more about the project (you can skip this!), this is a side project that I've been working on for almost a year.\nI'm a back-end developer and the stack runs in Python. If you'd like more details, please feel free to ask, I'll be glad to answer !\nThanks for taking the time to read this, feel free to give any feedback, I would be really grateful :) !\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32622866\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I'm not a web developer, but I dabble in it because I find it interesting. I went through some courses like The Odin Project and others to learn the basics of HTML/CSS/JS, and I thought it made a lot of sense: HTML structures the page, CSS handles the style, and JS handles the functionality.\nHowever, after working for software companies for a few years, it seems like almost nobody uses these technologies in the way they're presented on websites like w3schools to make web applications. Instead, they use component-based frameworks like React. To me, these frameworks seem way more complicated than HTML/CSS/JS, and I don't understand what problem they're trying to solve. What makes the trade-off of all that extra complexity and abstraction worth it? Aren't HTML/CSS/JS perfectly fine and time-tested tools for web development on their own?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32780191\nPoints: 250\n# Comments: 316",

I recently tried Amazon and sold a few but was shocked by the 15% cut.\nI'm wondering if I can/should make an online shop using vanilla html and css with PayPal/Stripe API payment buttons. I only have 3 product models and don't need shopping carts as most people would just buy one item. Shipping fee will also be fixed. No need for SEO or analytics. I have made a few websites before and enjoy making simple lightweight ultra-fast websites, so time spent on developing the website wouldn't be a cost to me.\nAny security / legal / business aspects that I should consider?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32561349\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hoping the collective wisdom of HN can help me with this one:\nI'm currently archiving a site for a client which was built in WordPress [I know! I know!] by creating a static version from it. So I've used `curl` to download the entire site and spent a few days stripping out the tangled mess of WordPress cruft.\nNext in my sites is the CSS. I've consolidated the eleventy billion CSS files strewn throughout WP into one central CSS file, which is about 3000 lines long. And now need to strip out all the unused selectors... of which I suspect there are many, because the site is mostly just plain text articles with occasional illustrations. No fancy-schmancy stuff at all.\nPlenty of advice on the web about using Chrome Dev tools to check for unused CSS against a single page. But this is a site of 500+ pages, so I need something that will crawl the entire project and compile a list of all the CSS used/unused across the entire site.\nOn the face of it this seems like one of those horribly repetitive tasks which would be a nightmare for a human to do, but trivial for a computer. A solution wouldn't even need to automagically strip the CSS out. Even just marking the used elements would allow me to see what was required or not and manually delete the rest. Pseudo-code-ually:\n  for HTML file in project \n  look for class=XXX or id=#YYY\n  look through project CSS file for .XXX or #YYY\n  insert comment /*this is used in file ZZZ.html*/\n\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32530595\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",
