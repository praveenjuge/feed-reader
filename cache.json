There are a couple of useful (free) tools I reach for on these occasions.\nn:point\nn:point provides lightweight, publicly accessible API endpoints for your JSON data. It’s super easy to use: simply give it some JSON and it sets up an endpoint in seconds. No messing about with access tokens, it’s ideal if you just want to fetch some data. You can also define and lock the JSON schema. I’m using n:point for a Codrops article on creating an interactive line graph based on timeseries data.\nMockeroo\nIf you need to actually generate some data, Mockeroo is a tool that enables you to do just that. You can add rows of different types and Mockeroo will generate random data. There are configuration options, including setting ranges (for numbers and dates, for example), and including null values. If you’re happy writing Ruby, you can also include formulas and you can download the data in different formats.\nI’ve only used Mockeroo for generating JSON, but you can also create API endpoints. It’s not as quick as n:point to set up, but looks useful if you need to mock any more complex API requests.",

          "description": "The YouTube gods surfaced me a video of classical guitarist Brandon Acker comparing a $200 guitar, a $2,000 guitar, a $20,000 guitar, and a $200,000 guitar. As you step up in orders of magnitude in cost, you start to see what creates value: the materials, the resonance, the sustain, the ease of playability. I’ve played guitar all my life and I never even imagined $200,000 guitars existed. I won’t spoil which one is the best but the result is shocking! Every guitarist I’ve talked to that’s seen this video had the same reaction.\ntl;dr- I would love to see someone do this with websites.\nBonus: Building a classical guitar from scratch\n\nIf you want a behind the scenes look at what goes into making a $20,000 guitar, musician and YouTuber Rob Scallon spends a week+ building a classical guitar with the same classical guitar luthier from the previous video,  Marshall Bruné. It’s a two hour video and I gobbled up every minute. Planks of wood and chunks of bone transformed through bending, shaving, sanding, gluing, and polishing; a transfiguration into a masterpiece. Incredible.\nAs mentioned in other carpentry videos I’ve watched, I love the little glimpses into the bespoke tools experts create to do their job well; the benders, the shapers, the hole cutters. The processes too! The fretboards are aged a minimum of seven years in a humidity controlled environment! How would you even know to do that without centuries of institutional knowledge? It’s interesting to see where these masters of their craft draw the line on what to do bespoke (the body) and where to leverage prefabrication and modern machinery (the neck).\ntl;dr- I would love to see someone do this with websites.",

The tokens could then be redeemed for activity on other websites. Since then, we've received feedback that the name led to a misunderstanding that the API provided a signal of trust determined by the browser. The word \"trust\" has different meanings for different sites, and the website issuing the token determines the signal of trust.\nWe're renaming the Trust Token API to Private State Token API to better showcase its privacy and utility benefits.\nThe API provides a small amount of storage to allow organizations to convey information from one context (token issuance) to another (token redemption)  in a privacy-preserving manner.

No reading, searching, user profiles, or any other feature.\n+ Users too just want it to post. We can assume many users don't want any apps - including this one - to routinely examine their user profiles, followers, or protected memberships on the platform.\n+ However - and here's the problem IMO - the API's /post endpoint forces the app to have \"read readuser post\" scopes just to call this post-only API. (\"Scopes\" are OAuth terminology for broad permissions).\nWhy I think this is bad design:\n+ The API fails to differentiate between external access and internal  access.

We've recently hired a new development team, and I'd like to learn more technical skills in order to really understand the development side of the product, as well as to communicate ideas better and to understand our design constraints. I have a little bit of coding experience from school and am using some online tools to learn CSS/HTML/Javascript. I'm also using some online resources to learn about software architecture. Is this the best way to go about this? What would be some good resources for me to learn this skills?

I've been a software engineer for over a decade, but it wasn't until the pandemic that I decided to take a leap of faith and build an innovative solution to designing data models.\nMost applications & SDKs support more than one platform. And for each platform, software engineers write and maintain the same (or similar) data models.\nI thought that if I could design data models completely independent of a database or a programming language in a way that allows versioning and collaboration and then generate the model code for whatever the technology stack is, it would be pretty cool.\nOneGen doesn't work as a one-time code generator. Instead, you design and continuously maintain your data models right inside the app to achieve a single source of truth.\nWe're excited to announce our free beta release to you.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33533340\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "MakePlace is a PC app that lets you drag-and-drop furniture and edit floorplans. The goal is to make interior design easy and fun, like playing with Lego.\nIt started off as an app to simulate housing in an MMORPG, since the furniture system there was atrocious. I'm now trying to adapt it as a simulator for general interior design.\nLike many 3D design software, there are a bunch of tools and controls, and first-time users may feel somewhat lost. So I've made a starting tutorial to help ease users into the controls. Do you think the tutorial works well?\nLet me know what else can be improved!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33468495\nPoints: 14\n# Comments: 5",

The backend is in place, but I'm not quite comfortable with the UI part. I need to build a UI that is responsive. Are there any recommended drap/drop UI builders that can export the required HTML/CSS that I can just shove into my existing rails app?\nSites like wordpress will allow me to create a UI and some backend but it is a new backend that I'll need to learn.

          "description": "So much talk about Twitter alternatives in recent days, including people migrating to Mastodon and even Jack Dorsey announcing his new decentralized social media platform.\nI was thinking, if I was to build a new micro-blogging aka Twitter alternative, what technological choices would I make to get it quickly off the ground but allow for scale?\nWhat database technology or approach would you go for?\nWould you build a (mobile first) web application first or would you start straight away with a native iOS/Android app (maybe Flutter)?\nWould you go for a centralised or decentralized approach? If the latter, how would you decentralize it without sacrificing the \"public town square\" effect that Twitter currently has but is clearly lacking with the fragmentation of Mastodon?\nTo answer my own question, I would probably build a centralized platform like Twitter is now, probably opt for a fast NoSQL database like Google's Firestore in Datastore mode and to keep things simple I would probably even make sure that tweets would get automatically deleted after some years as I don't think it's needed to build a forever growing database of people's thoughts in that moment that persists for decades to come. Micro-blogging always felt to me as a thing right now, a thought in this moment but that thought could be different in a few days, months and definitely a few years, so why store it forever. Feels like I could save a huge operational cost and prevent abuse by not keeping tweets for beyond their relevancy.\nWhat are your thoughts?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33419574\nPoints: 137\n# Comments: 311",

I am specifically looking for actual implementation examples and architecture examples and not just covering the basic theory or use.\nBackground/context:\nI am working on an application where I need to share various datastructures between threads. I've been using atomics but as the complexity grows it becomes hard to review code for \"correctness\". My goal is to avoid holding locks for long periods of time. Since this is a realtime application I also want to avoid waiting. So lock-free, wait-free is preferred.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33390423\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

I searched for a widget that would show me upcoming events in some \"always visible\" way, but all apps showed the schedule in a separate window. So I decided to make a new app that would show a schedule right in a Dock icon.\nMore to this, My Upcoming Events shows a countdown in the same Dock icon several minutes before the start of the event, which is handy for me, so I can start right on time.\nLimitations: MacOS, Google Calendar only.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33371373\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

I'm pretty sure it was an article published after 2019.\nHopefully someone remembers this and can share the link with me in the comments.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33311156\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I'm working on an LED art project that combines a few realtime signals; audio and some other inputs to inform the visuals. I'm running things on an ESP32 right now and doing an FFT and some other sort of seat-of-the-pants DSP stuff on one core while the other handles bluetooth, LED control, etc. I've got some time to mess around and I'd like to get a broad strokes overview of the embedded DSP field to inform myself on where to explore next. I've got a fair bit of hands on experience but little formal training.\nUltimately the goal is to *make good art* so I'm not really looking for anything specific. In my head I'll get some good papers/textbooks/libraries/articles recommended to me and then I'll spend a few weeks to write toy implementations of whatever seems interesting in C to get a feel for the space.\nI'm particularly looking for the nitty-gritty type stuff, cool hacks that save cycles and improve latency, my goal here is visceral reactivity and I'd like to get some more tools in my toolkit that allow me to interpret and combine signals in realtime in interesting ways. Even info on cool math hacks like Carmack's fast inverse square root would be appreciated.\nP.S. Also of interest is material on debugging and modelling realtime code.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33294641\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

I used to dislike Graylog because of the clunky interface, but I just cannot extract anything from CloudWatch! My logs are there, I can view them but it's impossible to query them:\n- on the Log Streams page, the pagination doesn't work, I can only view page 1\n- if I do \"Search all streams\" with a basic filter (something like `foo = \"bar\"`) it doesn't return anything (I know there are some matches I can see them)\n- Logs Insights is limited to the last 3 hours of logs\nIs there an alternative CloudWatch interface somewhere that would allow me to finally query my logs?

I can find lots of resources such as video tutorial or the schematics for the power, adc, dac, etc.\nBut I cannot find any hands-on tutorial on SDRAM, neither software nor hardware connection. I don't know what those pins on SDRAM are for and how can I connect them to the MCU.\nIs there any book about this topic?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33225884\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

I started on this with [html2notion](https://github.com/Jeadie/html2notion), but it turned out to be alot of work.\nWith Notion already having a [Notion web clipper](https://www.notion.so/web-clipper), I was wondering if it was worth implementing? Personally I read a small fraction of the blog posts from my RSS feed, and I like the spare page to take notes. For me, notion-rss solves the one core problem I have, acquiring and filtering high quality RSS feeds.

          "description": "I'm fairly new to the field and relatively late to the party (because I'm old), but a recurring theme that I'm noticing in my current company (which is a small startup) is how the faster you deliver the better you look to the CEO and even CTO's eyes.\nIn hour fairly infrequent meetings other engineers have raised the point that we should start valuing code quality and proper testing to our codebase, only to be met with arguments such as \"the customer doesn't pay for good code\".\nFurthermore, most likely an anecdotal bias and nothing else but I want to mention it: Online elitism revolves around shipping speed too. Comments like \"I can build X in Y hours\", \"I can skim the docs and build what I want with Z library in less than a day\", and so on.\nHow does everyone feel about it? Maybe it's just me but it feels weird. It's kinda like everyone I mentioned feels like there are no trade-offs to be concerned in regards to speed over quality or people decided that there's no reason to bother ourselves with contemplating what we're trading off speed with. Also, I feel that because quality is subjective and perfect is the enemy of done, people rely on objective metrics like \"time taken\".\nIs there truth and merit to this observation?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33394730\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

If you encounter bugs or want to give feedback, you can drop a comment here or message me on Twitter at @kdamica.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33367338\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

You then get one RSS feed which combines all releases into one stream.\nCreating multiple streams that combine by topic, programming language or whatever would be great too.\nDoes something like this exist? Or something similar? I know that Github offers feeds for single projects, but it feels tedious to add like 50+ single feeds to the reader.\nThanks for any tips!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33209227\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

I'd like to keep a copy of the raw HTML files I'm scraping for historical purposes, and also in case there's a bug and I need to re-run the scrapers.\nThis sounds like a great usage for a forward proxy like Squid or Apache Traffic Server. However, I couldn't find in their docs a way to both:\n* Keep a permanent history of the cached pages\n* Access old versions of the cached pages (think Wayback Machine)\nDoes anyone know if this is possible? I could potentially mirror the pages using wget or httrack, but a forward cache is a better solution as the caching process is driven by the scraper itself.\nThanks!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33563016\nPoints: 23\n# Comments: 16",

It's especially well suited to try out changes quickly, but I've built most of the landing page with the help of the extension itself.\nYou can try it out in the landing page itself (no need to install anything).\nFeatures:\n- Click on any class (eg: px-4) and try out other values easily.\n-  Preview the website in responsive mode and quickly toggle between breakpoints. auto detects breakpoints set in the config.\n- Quickly try out new variants. Supports arbitrary variants too.\n- Lets you try out arbitrary and negative property values.\n- Add, remove or re-order elements.\n- Edit element attributes and text nodes\netc.\nI'm excited to share it here and would love to hear your feedback and suggestions.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33534806\nPoints: 7\n# Comments: 0",
