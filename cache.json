          "description": "I got some landscaping done this month and as a reward the YouTube algorithm brought me a new genre of video called “Tall Grass”. These are the lawns with shoulder high grass, filled with mice and snakes, endlessly consuming buildings, fences, and concrete. It’s complete and utter ASMR for me.\n\nMy favorite among them is Al Bladez. Al and his best friend AJ take one day a week and offer to mow someone-in-need’s yard for free. To be clear, there’s an economy here, the homeowner gets their yard mowed and Al gets a YouTube video out of the deal which garners a million views. But the homeowners — and more often than not, the neighbors — are incredibly thankful to see the transformations.\nThe circumstances differ from yard to yard. Sometimes the homeowner is elderly, ailing, deceased, or in the hospital; unable or unfit to mow their lawn. In those situations Al’s work is a simple act of charity.\nSometimes, the homeowner is perfectly able but hasn’t mowed their lawn. What I love about Al is that he doesn’t show an ounce of judgement. Al doesn’t care if you’ve been in jail, or if you’re too poor, your mower broke, you’re unemployed, you’re struggling with addiction, or you’re just plain lazy. He’s there to cut grass — tall grass — and bring a bit of pride back to his community and hopefully help people dodge citations from the city.\nTo top it off, Al’s personal slogan is “Impact Over Views” and whew, that’s a lot to think about. I love that outlook and wish I could embody it more.\nWhatever religion Al is peddling, I want to be a part of it.",

This weekend I started on my planned redesign, but as I started nudging my About section, I found myself in a fight with my typography. After some hemming and hawing, I made the drastic decision to nuke my stylesheets and start over.\n~81 file changes later, I made another decision to yeet my changes live and do an open redesign. Not my original plan, but it’ll be good blog fodder. One thing I want to avoid is killing blogging momentum by getting sunk in a redesign branch.\nWithout further ado, as with any redesign, let’s see what we’re dealing with first…\nWebsite feature inventory\nHere’s a list of all the features on my little website that I maintain:\n330+ blog posts\nArt-directed posts with custom CSS, JavaScript, and SV…",

PARA is a way to organize your digital life in to separate buckets: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives.\n\nAfter watching some videos, I started applying PARA to my second brain in Notion. The timing to choose to redo my entire Notion setup was horrible, of course. I was busy with work, writing a workshop, moving ShopTalk to its own YouTube channel… why not pick up another big project and redo my entire organization system?\nThe psychology checks out though. When large tasks loom you don’t feel in control over your schedule and doing something you can control (like organizing your organizer) helps you feel more in control. And it did help.

          "description": "Providing visibility into your work is one of the most underrated developer soft skills. Coworkers are often too busy to keep track of what’s going on with engineering work, even if it’s their job to know what’s going on with engineering work. It’s generally not out of malice or lack of interest, but a lack of time and energy to chase down every issue or conversation thread. And to be fair, engineering is an opaque process where we trick the rocks inside a computer to act like a business.\nStandups are a great tool for sharing visibility. Unfortunately, not everyone loves standups. I’ve personally experienced some extremely toxic scrum master situations. Impersonal bots can have the same effect. A daily status report can feel like micromangement leading to a loss of autonomy. Also, that vis…",

An organisation could have one or more sub organisations. \n3. An organisation (or sub organisation) would be subscribed to one or more products\n4.

The few articles on google were either outdated (Job's legacy) or blog with opinions and speculations.\nWhat are they doing right that most tech companies miss? Or is it not design, but a distinctive leadership and strategy that works?\nSome \"more verifiable\" sources:\n[1] https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/40448/how-does-apple-manage-to-deliver-its-user-experience\n[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3uR6IDSHSM\nWould love to hear from insiders if possible, thanks.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30928671\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hey, HN! When building user interfaces for smaller and mobile apps you've got quite a few tools to choose from. Figma and the like work great for them. But for the complex projects we do at our UX agency, those tools are a pain to use. Designing a control interface for an industrial machine in Figma doesn't make any fun. You often need to somehow hack the interactions you need into it.\nTo make prototyping complex interfaces easier, we built Antetype.\nWith layouts that really adapt to changing content and (hopefully) easy-to-understand interaction options. For us, it really helps creating complex and working UIs – to test and validate ideas.\nAntetype is also build on web concepts: \nThat means you can use any HTML/CSS tricks you know and also any JS framework you require. We often use that to embed interactive 3D models or working charts (instead of static images).\nVideo of Antetype's features + prototypes built with it: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUBpJlLJrdY\nWebsite with examples + demo videos:\nhttps://www.antetype.com\nRegister to download it (macOS only):\nhttps://cloud.antetype.com/register/\n(You can use it entirely free. No water marks or restrictions. Our paid plan just takes care of hosting if you don't want to do it yourself.)\nI would love to hear your thoughts – we released it to the public just a few weeks ago.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30852905\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I recently realized that certain kinds of knowledge allow one to be significantly more productive when solving a large class of problems.\nFor example,\n* Regular expressions for simple text processing.\n* Parser combinators for parsing.\n* Parser generators (esp. packrat variety) for parsing.\n* The concept of fuzzing and property testing for testing code.\n* Calculus for solving all sorts of problems.\n* MCMC for solving a huge class of probability problems.\n* Search algorithms for solving a variety of problems (e.g. all NP-hard problems, sudoku, HTNs, scheduling, planning).\n* Gradient descent for solving a variety of optimization problems.\n* Vector Space embedding as a conceptual tool for a variety of complex AI problems.\n* Effect composition (Haskell's IO or Scala's ZIO) as an incredibly powerful paradigm for concurrency and parallelism.\nWhat are some examples of 10x multipliers that come to your mind? Fundamental ideas without which you would be drastically less productive.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30853807\nPoints: 310\n# Comments: 355",
