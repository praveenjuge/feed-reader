Twitter was never without its problems, but the consequences of it being run by an actual psychopath are already being felt. I was reluctant to have yet another social network to manage, but witnessing the mass exodus from Twitter of so many of the people I care about hearing from has led to my feed no longer feeling like the place it once was, as those voices gradually disappear. I guess I’ll still post on Twitter, for now, albeit less often. It’s a bit of a shame to leave behind the following that I’ve built up over the years of posting on this blog, but it’s not like…",

We also had a small Friendsgiving the Sunday before; it’s a great feeling to have a house full of kids and friends around the kitchen island spinning stories. I’m thankful for my friends and family.\nI resurfaced my interest in Qawwali music this month enjoying Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and the Nooran Sisters. I love it. The mix of storytelling and improv which has the potential to produce something like this…\n\nIndistinguishable from a Fleet Foxes song if you ask me. Sitting on the floor with your buds, harmonium and tablas, singing and echoing phrases, and people throwing money at you; seems like a sustainable music business model…",

          "description": "I was reading about Akira the other day and stumbled across an interesting casual fact:\nPainstakingly animated by hand, the care that went into Akira can be seen in every frame; there’s 327 different colour shades in the film, 50 of which were invented for it.\nFifty colors! Invented! An incredulous claim, but here’s a clip from a contemporaneous behind-the-scenes VHS documentary of Akria explaining the situation with the invented colors.\n\nTo accommodate the dark themes of the film and the five-stage variations of character shading, they added 50 shades of color to the commonly-used animation color palette. You can see the physical color palette in a couple places in the clip.\nKimie Yamana adding more… ahem… color… to the topic.\nIf you look at the color chart you’ll see the tremendous variety of dark tones. Many colors you wouldn’t see in other animation. There’s such subtlety in the various tones, you wouldn’t notice them on a television screen. But in the theater the large variety of colors really makes a difference.\nAdding more, almost imperceptible, tones to the color palette allowed the neon-noir setting of a cyberpunk Neo Tokyo to thrive. Light plays a major role in the film and the use of color allowed the city itself to come alive as a character. A shadowy city that has light, life, and explosions.\nImpressive. If you watch the whole behind the scenes video, you get a sense of the massive undertaking that was Akira. Blockbuster budgets and all the big name studios pitching in to make something bigger than themselves. Something timeless. Something breathtaking.",

          "description": "Dragon’s Heaven is an eccentric anime directed by Makoto Hashimoto that —after hearing about it— I instantly dropped everything to watch it. It’s a giant robot mech anime with a Mœbius-”inspired” aesthetic. Actually, it’s a 100% rip-off of Mœbius, but it’s so well executed it stands on its own as something uniquely original (in a “great artists steal” kind of way). All the sand blowing and dimpled grunge effects that characterize Mœbius’s work were done by hand frame by frame… it’s a stunning work of art.\nThe sci-fi stands on its own as well. It’s the story of Ikuru, a girl in the year 3195 who awakens a robot named Shaian who has been dormant for 1,000 years. Shaian deactivated itself after a battle when its human copilot was killed in action. Shaian soon discovers his nemesis is still operational and doing battle in Brazil. It’s a Machines vs. Machines+Humans story with an assertive female protagonist. It makes you think about the relationships between humans and machines; will it be symbiotic or authoritarian? Also the notion that machines will outlive their human counterparts by millennia and hold on to centuries-long beef is interesting to think about as we feed machines with our biases in the present day.\nBut that’s not all! It gets weirder (beyond the awkward robot-human innuendo). The film is sandwiched between a poorly shot, ultra-smokey practical effects title sequence on the frontside and a documentary of how the director himself made the title sequence on the backside. It has the vibe of a gritty 1980s behind-the-scenes (like Alien or Star Wars) but also the air that no one could tell Hashimoto “No, this model thing isn’t good.” Some human quirks wrapped up in a film about two embattled robots.\nIf you’re curious about something called “Dragon’s Heaven” but has very little to do with actual dragons, I recommend it on the artwork alone. Feel free to skip all the non-anime parts.",

His interest waned fast (read: in minutes), but I still play it! I grew up with a piano in the house so I’ve always been able to noodle, and I took a class in college, but I’ve never been able to fluently read sheet music enough to enjoy playing the piano. That is until I found E-Z Play Today music books1.\n\nE-Z Play Today music books are beginner level books that take the mystery out of musical notation. Each note gets its corresponding letter inside it, no stacked notes, and bass chords written in a boxes above the staff. It’s guitar tabs but for piano and I love it.\nAre they the exact notes? No.\nAre the melodies just single notes? Yes.\nDoes it help me learn musical notation? Maybe.\nAre almost all the songs transposed to the Key of C so they’re easier to play? Yes.\nE-Z Play Today meets me where I am. It’s almost exactly what I want out of a song book; “Here’s the minimum viable version of this well-known song.” I have no dreams of becoming a concert pianist, I just want to enjoy playing the piano without feeling illiterate and uncoordinated. My left hand is playing a melody and my right hand is holding down a chord. Easy.\nAs dumbed down as this may be, I’m enjoying the approach and there’s a wide variety of genres and artists in their collection. I’m sure I’ll buy more. I broke out the Christmas song book in November and it’s been a small bit of joy to fill the house with some holiday spirit.\nNever change this website please. ↩",

I love this video because it reminds me of simpler times where we watched idle videos on the internet all day instead of the staring in abject horror at the endless timeline. A single man knocking down a silo, what a metaphor for our current times! The silo falling also reminds me of an old Texan-ism by former Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn:\nAny jackass can kick a barn down, but it took a carpenter to build it.\nNow we are barn-less.

          "description": "In recent weeks, a handful of people asked me what’s been happening in Web Components Land. Well, as President of Web Components, I have good news and the state of Web Components is pretty strong right now.\nI did my Frontend Masters course on Web Components in April and since then there’s even more positive momentum happening in the Web Components space. Here’s a high-level list of developments over the last 6 months or so:\nAccording to the 2022 Jamstack Survey “Web Components have arrived” (jamstack.org)\nBrad Frost talks about web components (bradfrost.com)\nSafari is prototyping Declarative Shadow DOM (github.com)\nElement Internals is under development in Safari (github.com)\nWebkit turned on Constructable/Adopted Stylesheets (github.com)\nEleventy introduced WebC … which isn’t capital-”WC” Web Components, but shares a similar ethos\nEnhance.dev is a whole framework built on web components\nWeb Components Community Group collected their list of top concerns for TPAC\nExciting times. When I filmed my course, these more advanced Web Component concepts (Declarative Shadow DOM, Element Internals, Adopted Stylesheets, etc) were a smidge depressing to talk about because of their unknown Safari status. I could say the technology existed, but provide no roadmap for when it would get better support. But, if I’m reading these standards positions right, hopefully the consumer branch of Safari will support them soon.\nOn top of more feature support, more tooling is also great news for Web Components. Alternate takes, different ideas, varied perspectives! While it can cause some confusion when navigating the Web Component waters, the more perspectives the better for these little building blocks.\nWatch my Frontend Masters Course",

This allows sites\nto build easy sign-in experiences that are more secure.\n# What is a passkey?\nA passkey is a digital credential, tied to a user account and a website or application. Passkeys are more secure than\npasswords because they enable users to sign in to apps and websites with a\nbiometric sensor (such as a fingerprint or facial recognition), PIN, or pattern,\nfreeing them from having to remember and manage passwords. Because they are\nWebAuthn credentials, they include the\nfollowing security features:\nPasskeys use public-key cryptography so sites don't have to store passwords or secrets.\nUsers can't be phished because a passkey can only be used with the website or app that created it.\nWebsites could create and use WebAuthn credentials on devices and\nsecurity keys via a modal UI in the browser. To do so, websites had to\nredesign their sign-in flow to let users select the WebAuthn flow using a\nseparate button. By allowing passkeys to enable autofill, websites can now\nprovide the same experience for both password and passkey users.\n# Conditional UI\nAllowing websites to make a WebAuthn request without triggering the modal UI is\ncalled \"conditional mediation\". This autofill integration is often referred to\nas a conditional\nUI.\n          \n  A user signing in with a condtional UI\n\n# How it works\nAs soon as the user taps on the username input field, an autofill suggestion\ndialog pops up with the stored passkeys and password autofill suggestions. The\nuser can then choose an account and use the device screen lock to sign in. This\nenables users to sign in to the website with the existing password form as if\nnothing has changed, but with the added security benefit of\npasskeys.\n# How to use conditional UI\nTo use the WebAuthn conditional UI, learn how to Create a passkey for\npasswordless logins and Sign in with a\npasskey through form autofill.\nPhoto by Scott Graham on Unsplash",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nDuring this year we have been building Depoxy, a tool for managing and optimizing data pipelines on AWS.\nThe main reasons for building Depoxy are:\nthe current UIs for managing data pipelines are inefficient\noptimizing data pipelines has a lot of potential both in CO2 and financial terms\nWhere is this inefficiency coming from and how much better we can get?\nThe UI and the tooling around data services are not integrated at the level it is optimal. This is the reason why having an integrated UI improves the workflows by 50% (22s vs 54s). You can check out the video we have about a simple workflow.\nHow much optimization?\nWe have 10 years experience with various clients in this space and based on the previous experiences the optimization potential is between 10 - 30% year over year infrastructure cost. This is a lot for many companies, especially nowadays.\nWhere are we with this product?\nThis is the first iteration of the product and we just got started. The next iteration is going to be metadata analytics engine for data that is stored on AWS S3. Based on the metadata we can get insight into the efficiency of the data set and provide guidance for optimizing it.\nThe second next iteration we are planning to implement a SQL parsing engine that provides automatic data lineage so that people can track how data flows through their system.\nDetailed blog post with a lot more:\nhttps://www.depoxy.dev/blog/2022-12-07-introducing-depoxy\nLet us know what you think. If you find any problems, issues (even security bugs) please let us know. Thank you in advance.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33896367\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 0",

I've also found myself doing my prototyping using plain JSON files on disk, and then \"productionizing\" to use a database when I need to deploy.\nSo: suppose I wanted to be able to have multiple web servers - it's nice to be able to create more servers as needed - read and write data to a disk. What would one do? What's the easiest way to share files across multiple servers? How do you ensure you have enough disk?

          "description": "I am willing to bet (inflation-adjusted) 1000$ that in the next decade, multiple teams will see the advent of Wasm and WebGPU as a perfect reason to have yet another go at a cross-plattform UI framework. These projects will claim to have \"native\" UI elements, but it will be obvious that the are really just rebuilding everything to look like the native counterparts (similar to Flutter). Especially on macOS and iOS, major interactions will be unsupported or implemented in wrong ways (problems will likely occur around the menu bar, keyboard navigation, and integration with OS services). Scrolling will feel off on touchscreen devices and text rendering will differ from the native look. Still, some of these frameworks will have tens of thousands of stars on GitHub and be used by major companies. I would not be surprised if these frameworks were built with Rust and be seen by many as the thing that would finally bring Rust to the mainstream. I see it as likely that in whatever language these frameworks will be written, they will introduce some weird new syntax and paradigms to accomodate a more \"intuitive\" (probably declarative) style of writing UI code. Meanwhile, little to no progress will be made developing techniques and frameworks to build apps that are actually better for the end user.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33730173\nPoints: 27\n# Comments: 11",

Withdraw money from wallet \n  4. Running audits to ensure all transactions are correct\non a Relational DB.

There are online lists of peoples favorite SID music, and online players, see [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]. Because I have different tastes, I had the motivation to make my own list and UX. So from january 2020 to september 2022, I listened through the HVSC having over 50k songs, resulting in a list of 600-700 favorites. I put together a UX so I can easily access them. This project is mostly for my own enjoyment, but I guess that many others here would also enjoy it. Please let me know if you have suggestions for songs I should reconsider adding, or some feedback on the UX.\n[1] Show HN: Online SID-Player with spectrum viewer (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6750701)\n[2] High Voltage SID Collection – Commodore 64 music for the masses (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28184104)\n[3] Dial-a-Sid (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27735256)\n[4] The Sid Collection (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32368634)\n[5] WebGL SID-emulator in C++ compiled to JavaScript with Emscripten (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7270025)\n[6] DeepSID: online SID (Commodore 64 music) player (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17055344)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33637292\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

I've been hired as a full-time UX designer and am currently leading a team of three design interns. I have no real experience running a design team, and am wondering how I should best proceed in managing the team. Things have been pretty disorganized, and we recently had a meeting in which most of our time was spent in pretty unproductive disagreement. As the person who is more or less running the design team I feel totally responsible for this, and would like to know how I could best run meetings and assign tasks in order to generate lots of ideas, while making sure discussion stays productive come decision making time. I'd also appreciate any tips on how to facilitate healthy discussion when discussing differences in opinions. I'm really new to all of this and a bit out of my element, but I really want to do my best and would appreciate any advice.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33616047\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 3",

These are your personal habits (and they stay on your phone). I want zero access to your data.\n- Minimal friction. Habit tracking requires dedication, so it should require almost no effort to stay on top of it.\n- No gimmicks. Really, no games, prizes, etc. Just want to build an effective tool.\n- No lock-in. Your data is yours. It is saved locally to a text file you can inspect or export at any time.\n- No sign-up or account. There really is no need for it. Period.\n- No social. Social really just gets in the way. These are your habits, focus on them.\n- No analytics. None of any kind. If you like the app or there's a bug, just report it.\n- Text-based. Not that it matters to many users, but all data is stored to a text file in org mode.\nI've used the app thoroghly and managed to rack up a decent year and a half of continuous running and meditation amongst other habits. The app has 114 ratings (across all countries) with a 4.8 score. But, the app hasn're really picked up many users (1-5 daily downloads) even as a free app.\nSo, what is this habit tracker missing? What do you actually want in a habit tracker?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33842599\nPoints: 11\n# Comments: 10",

          "description": "I built a habit tracker https://flathabits.com to scratch an itch. I really wanted to do the right thing for the users. The driving principles were as follows:\n- Privacy. These are your personal habits (and they stay on your phone). I want zero access to your data.\n- Minimal friction. Habit tracking requires dedication, so it should require almost no effort to stay on top of it.\n- No gimmicks. Really, no games, prizes, etc. Just want to build an effective tool.\n- No lock-in. Your data is yours. It is saved locally to a text file you can inspect or export at any time.\n- No sign-up or account. There really is no need for it. Period.\n- No social. Social really just gets in the way. These are your habits, focus on them.\n- No analytics. None of any kind. If you like the app or there's a bug, just report it.\n- Text-based. Not that it matters to many users, but all data is stored to a text file in org mode.\nI've used the app thoroghly and managed to rack up a decent year and a half of continuous running and meditation amongst other habits. The app has 114 ratings (across all countries) with a 4.8 score. But, the app hasn're really picked up many users (1-5 daily downloads) even as a free app.\nSo, what is this habit tracker missing? What do you actually want in a habit tracker?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33819202\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

Not sure how I would fit these\nHowever, I have been struggling with keeping my inbox clean and readable with the newsletters and am considering to switch to an RSS reader. I have several criteria:\n1. I need to be able to add one-off articles to the reader (such as finding an interesting article on Hackernews for later consumption).\n2. I would love to be able to add rules. For example, if I don't read an article for several days, I would like it to disappear from my inbox (archived) or be marked as read so it doesn't clog my reading.\n3. Needs to be accessible on computer (web/app) and  mobile (ideally via app).\nWould love to hear how other people manage this. I'm also happy to pay for a good solution here.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33613354\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 8",

          "description": "I have been using SideKick browser to manage multiple accounts in one place otherwise switching between Chrome profiles was a pain but recently I figured out SideKick automatically changes my WhatsApp status to \"Available (via SideKick browser). Not only this, they also change the status on Discord, Slack, Telegram and many other apps.\nThis is a Growth Hack for them but this was very frustrating for me to know and especially they don't have any authority over my WhatsApp Status.\nWhen I did some reverse engineering, I found SideKick is adding an extension that injects content script on web.whatsapp.com and it changes the WhatsApp status automatically every 3 days or so and then they also send the analytics events to their servers.\nThey may/may not be doing anything with my data but the bigger question is when people over Internet are using browsers like these, they get full access to what you browse and everything else like Cookies, Passwords, etc.\nEven they can stitch your sessions in Incognito if they want in the backend \\_(~_~)_/. Who knows.\nBrowser extensions are still vetted by respective vendors like Google & Mozilla but how do we ensure we are browsing the Internet safely?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33606176\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Web crawling in this day and age is loaded with caveats, and must be done carefully as to not put an unnecessary load on other people's infrastructure. I'd really like to try to make my own web search tool, so I'm trying to scope out something simple enough to get me started. Here's what I have so far.\n- I don't want to parse anything in the SimilarWeb Top 50.\n- I don't want to render JS\n- I'd like to keep a web index that is still measured in TBs\nI've done search engines for research papers in the past. The key difference was that I could collect that data very easily through a documented API. Now I need to either build or use a crawler and I'm not sure where to begin. Here are some thoughts that I have so far.\n- I'm probably going to write the crawler in Go. It seems like a good fit for this sort of software.\n- How do I start collecting lists of domains? Do I just start hitting public IPv4 addresses on Ports 80 and 443?\n- If I run something like this with proper rate limiting on a server, would Cloudflare inevitably just start blocking me?\n- If I were to run this from a machine connected to the Internet via a residential ISP, then would I get a nasty letter from my ISP?\nAny advice or feedback is appreciated. The goal of this project is to learn more about web crawling moreso than to build a product that would be sold.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33824222\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

It is more similar to selectorlib - where it defines the Selector definitions in YAML file, but with the difference, that it supports more than one selector per field, which in turn allows you to have one yaml definition per different HTML variations of a website. It also tries to validate the selector expressions before running the parsing. At this point I am looking for some feedback, so I can improve.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33812391\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Coming from WPF and Winform, I find web development to be unnecessarily complex, but I refuse to believe that’s true.\nI just want to make a simple web app, no React, Angular or any of that. That can’t be too hard right? I’m sure in large scale, that stuff has its place, but I don’t need it. To me, the browser is the UI framework.\nWhen I Google around to get started, I find obnoxious Medium articles. I don’t want to copy and paste instructions and throw something together without a clue what’s going on. Mozilla has good documentation, but I don’t know what’s a good source to actually get a web app running locally that I can eventually deploy online. Do I really need Node? Compared to WPF/Winform this is a mess, or so I hope not.\nI want to make a simple app where users can create and fill out a form. ATC test plans, to be exact.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33635218\nPoints: 170\n# Comments: 166",

I thought it’s a good quiz to ask my international friends here to find out how well these icons work. Now think about using only icons for an interface again. The idea of building these icons is to reduce friction in the user interface and to clean up endless text options but what is it worth if no one knows what the symbol really means? I myself struggle a lot when apps have text links for everything but the user login / registration or account link is a symbol that’s hard to identify (is it the login, the sign up, the logout icon?).\nBetter try to clean up interfaces so the text alone works well. If you then add icons in a subtle way to support users reading the text that’s fine. On this topic, Jim Nielsen has …",

It’s nice to see how web development evolves, cross-browser support is great for most of the things and we can focus on building great experiences. The result is for example Mastodon, a communication service built on web standard protocols, independent of big tech companies. Or Pixelfed, or PHP, the language that drives most of our server software. Web Components finally get some traction as more and more vendors of widgets build libraries around it. Thanks to all who help the web standards evolving, who help other people by creating open source solutions, to those who write how-to-use articles and to those who share them. Enjoy this week…",
