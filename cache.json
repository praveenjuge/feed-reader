          "description": "“Just whack a red asterisk next to each field and call it a day.”\nBack in 2008 I worked for a software house. We specialised in e-commerce sites for big organisations like Boots, Argos and Homebase.\nThey had the usual forms.\nRegistration, forgot password, sign in and checkout. We whacked little red asterisks next to each required field; added some text to the top to explain what it means; and called it a day.\nBut we never tested it.\nWe never even really thought about it.\nWe just followed what everyone else did.\nFast forward 15 years and the same thing happens today. Which is a shame as these little asterisks (and other techniques used to denote required) fields can be a real problem.\nSeeing as I get asked about this topic, I thought I’d cover it off so you can focus on more important probl…",

          "description": "In 2009 I was working on the Argos checkout flow.\nWe were considering focusing the first input when the page loads. The idea was to save users a click (never a good sign). Back then we had to use JS, but now we have the HTML5 autofocus attribute.\nEither way, automatically focusing the first input causes 5 specific problems that degrade UX.\nHere they are:\nProblem #1: it makes the page jump unexpectedly\nWhen any normal web page loads, focus remains at the top.\nWith autofocus, focus jumps suddenly to the first input.\nBut this is disorientating and may cause users to think something has gone wrong.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAutomatically focusing the input makes the page jump\n\t\n\nProblem #2: it stops users scrolling with the keyboard\nUsers often scroll a web page after page load by pressing ↑ and ↓.\nWith autofocus, the keys are ignored because the input is focused.\nThis makes the interface feel broken.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe up and down keys get ignored as focus is inside the input\n\t\n\nProblem #3: it stops users going back with the keyboard\nSome users navigate back by keyboard using #+← for example.\nWith autofocus, the shortcut is ignored because the input is focused.\nThis slows users down.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe keyboard shortcut to go back is ignored as focus is inside the input\n\t\n\nProblem #4: it’s unexpected for screen reader users\nWhen a web page loads, a screen reader announces the page title.\nWith autofocus, the input’s label is announced instead.\nThis is disorientating and causes users to lose context.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe screen reader announces the input instead of the page\n\t\n\nProblem #5: it works badly on mobile\nOn mobile, focusing an input usually opens the keyboard.\nWith autofocus this doesn’t happen. On Android, for example, the input is focused but the user has to tap again to open the keyboard.\nThis makes the interface feel broken.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tOn Android, the input is focused but the user needs to tap \n\t\n\nJust let users focus the first input\nGood design puts users in control.",

          "description": "In 2016 I worked at the Department for Work and Pensions.\nI was working on a complex form field made up of nested fieldsets. It was inaccessible which surprised me because I was only using fieldsets, legends, labels and radio buttons. Nothing fancy.\nBut as I did more research, it became clearer that nested fieldsets can be problematic.\nHere’s why:\nProblem #1: screen readers only announce the inner legend\nLet’s say you have appointment times organised by day and period.\nA fieldset for each day and for morning and afternoon\n\t\n\nIf the user moves from 3:15pm on Tuesday to 9:55am on Wednesday, screen readers will announce ‘9:55am, morning’. They will not announce ‘Wednesday 23 October’.\nThis is confusing and may cause users to select the wrong date. Or it may cause them to traverse the page line by line because they don’t trust the interface.\nProblem #2: screen readers won’t announce the end of a fieldset\nLet’s say you have a question that says ‘Do you like chocolate?’ And selecting ‘Yes’ reveals a nested question that says ‘Do you prefer light or dark chocolate?’\nRadio buttons that reveal another question\n\t\n\nIf the user moves from ‘Dark chocolate’ to ‘No’, screen readers will not announce that they left the inner fieldset.\nThis is confusing because ‘No’ does not make sense as an answer for ‘Do you prefer light or dark chocolate?’\nAvoid nested fieldsets where possible\nFor appointment times the fieldset for morning and afternoon could be removed because each label already says ‘am’ or ‘pm’.\nFor the conditional reveal the nested question could be shown on the next page. This may sound long winded but it usually reduces cognitive load and speeds users up.\n(Note: Some nested fieldsets may be okay. For example, I often use them to reveal a date field with day, month and year inputs after selecting ‘Yes’ to knowing that date. This hasn’t raised issues in accessibility audits.)",

          "description": "Last week I had the privilege of attending CSS Day for the second year in a row (and MCing the second day!). I have to say it’s pretty much the most inspiring conference I’ve ever been to.

As web applications grow larger, they inevitably fall prey to complexity, despite our best intentions. The prevalence of third-party libraries to solve everyday coding problems is both a blessing and a curse. It can be tempting to reach for an off-the-shelf solution to save time now, but what happens what happens when that dependency is no longer maintained, or when developer needs change?

          "description": "The Soviet Union had an engineering problem. Thousands of miles of remote frozen arctic coastline that needed lighthouses and radio towers which required power. But those places were too cold and too remote for human operators in the winter months, so the Soviets devised a plan to deploy small Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs). Radioactive strontium-90 heats an arrangement of metal fins, the fins cool, and a semiconductor turns that energy into electricity. The RTG’s design was the same tech the Soviet Union used to deploy radio to areas without power. What could go wrong?\nIt’s worth noting this was the advent of the nuclear era; the pre-Chernobyl era.

          "description": "I love Behind The Scenes style documentaries of animated films. It’s a niche genre but very fulfilling for me – a dad who watches almost exclusively animated TV and films with my children. Above is a playlist of ~20 short behind-the-scenes documentaries of some of the greatest animated films from some of the greatest animation studios. I rewatch all these from time to time and reference them frequently, so I thought I’d collect them in a playlist and share.\nThe obsession started before kids actually, as part of trying to learning how large creative projects are successful. I get a lot of inspiration from seeing how animated films come together. Animated films that take years to make are incredibly different from the work I do but share some principles that I feel apply to large software projects like websites.\nThere’s tons of gleanable insights from their processes and tools. Processes like “dailies” or a “brain trust” like they talked about in the book Creativity, Inc. seem apt for web development. I often wonder if a Producer/Director-model would be better for websites.\nI have some non-YouTube recommendations as well. I’ve posted some them before, but here’s a running list of documentaries and docu-series I’ve come across:\nBeyond Infinity (2022, Disney+)\nInto the Unknown: Making Frozen 2 (2020, Disney+)\nInside Pixar (2020, Disney+)\nI Know That Voice (2013, Prime Video)\nThe Kingdom of Dreams and Madness (2013, HBO Max)\nWaking Sleeping Beauty (2009, Disney+)\nThe Pixar Story (2007, Disney+)\nFrank and Ollie (1995, Disney+)\nAlways up for more YouTube and feature length documentaries, if you have any you liked send them my way.",

          "description": "The shorthand for embedding an image in Markdown is the following:\n\n![descriptive text goes here](example.jpg)\n\n\nThis works for rendering an image in the same way a skateboard is a minimum viable replacement for car; it rolls, but not fast. To render an image responsibly in modern times you need a handful more properties than src and alt ; namely height, width, loading, and decoding attributes.\n\n<img src=\"example.jpg\" \n     alt=\"descriptive text goes here\" \n     height=\"400\" \n     width=\"300\" \n     decoding=\"async\"\n     loading=\"lazy\">\n\n\nHere’s a quick summary of what those other attributes do and why you should have them:\nheight + width - The HTML spec changed slightly and now setting a height and width draws an aspect-ratio’d box for the image to paints in. This prevents layout shift as the image loads.\ndecoding=\"async\" (Optional) - This prevents the browser from blocking other content and move image decoding  it decodes the image data to a bitmap. I feel like this should be the browser default?\nloading=\"lazy\" (Optional) - Recommended for any image below the fold.\nHonorable mentions\nsrcset + sizes - If you want the fastest images, you can offer different sizes and cuts of your images. I don’t do this and Lighthouse is always mad about it.\nfetchpriority - This is like driving a manual stick shift, but may be useful. I think loading=\"lazy|eager\" are easier to reason about than fetchpriority but I’m not your boss.\nSome Markdown formatters have a custom syntax that supports adding more attributes, like Kramdown…\n\n![descriptive text goes here](example.jpg){: height=\"36px\" width=\"36px\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" }\n\n\nThis makes your Markdown less readable and less portable to other engines. If you’re going to include all these attributes, you might as well use an HTML <img> tag. This will make your images consistent with the other (unsupported without plugins) media like <video>, <audio>, <picture>, and <svg> in your Markdown posts.",

We firmly believe that the future of this type of rendering, especially during the ideation stage of a project, will be heavily reliant on generative AI.\nTraditionally, you would send your designs to a professional and potentially wait several days for the renders to be ready, all the while going back and forth with consultations. With Visoid, you can now receive instant, beautiful renders at a fraction of the cost.\nOur platform is designed for architects and rendering professionals who work with visualizations of architectural designs. Visoid enables our users to iteratively modify the scene, materials, and elements in a sketch, 3D model or similar, controlled with a simple prompt.\nWe're still in the early stages, and while the output isn't always perfect, we've made significant strides in improving the quality and the control of the output images. We're confident that it's only a matter of time before we can consistently deliver higher quality images and with even more control.\nWe're still figuring out how to fit this product into the workflow of our users and would love to get your feedback. I will try to answer any questions you have.\nFor more example images, have a look at our Instagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/visoidai/\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36341692\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "I recently decided to document and open-source the component library that I've been using internally on all my react-tailwindcss projects and share it.\nRewind-UI uses only TailwindCSS classes, which can be overridden using the className prop on each component or can be fully customized using a theme provider.\nIt is built on top of the CVA (class-variance-authority - https://cva.style/docs) library, so if anyone needs to adjust the theme, will just need to edit the CVA files.\nFurthermore it must be noted that you can add either all the style files in your tailwind.config.js file, or only those that you are going to use, so that you can avoid having a bloated css file.\nYou can check out the repository here: https://github.com/rewindui/rewindui\nEven though it is still in beta I would love to hear your feedback on it.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36254203\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

Which React UI libraries do you use?\n2. What are your biggest struggles with the UI libraries you use? Every library has its pros and cons. I'd love to know the pain points you encounter while working with your chosen UI library. Are there any specific challenges or limitations you've come across that hinder your development process?\n3. What features do you feel are missing from your favorite UI libraries? Are there any particular features or functionalities that you wish your favorite library offered?\n4. What do you enjoy most about your preferred UI library? What do you enjoy most about the library you use?\n5. What are the most important features you look for when choosing a React UI library? When evaluating different UI libraries, what factors do you prioritize?

It came up with a design that seems plausible to me (a non-expert), essentially using gyroscopes to induce controllable spin, and uses the Magnus effect to allow the orb to bend through the air like a soccer ball. Wanted to get Hacker New's take on whether this design is possible.\nStructure and Composition: The orb's structure is a sphere composed of strong, lightweight materials akin to those used in modern aircraft or spacecraft. These materials are capable of withstanding the pressures and forces experienced during flight while also minimizing the orb's overall weight.\nBuoyancy: The orb is filled with a lighter-than-air gas su…",

          "description": "I recently needed to check a past transfer to confirm that I was sending some crypto to the same wallet address. In the past, the last few transactions showed up on the \"Pay\" page. They have since renamed \"Pay\" to Transfers or something like that. They no longer show past transactions, so I went down a rabbit hole of searching through the app, couldn't find it, then had to google it and found a help page for Coinbase. There is a link in the article to coinbase.com/reports (I can find no way to get to it from the web app except by following the link from the help article.) Once there, you can select the date ranges you want and generate a transaction report in PDF or CSV and then you have to wait a bit while it generates the report for you to download.\nWhat kind of UI craziness is this? A user's transaction history is such a basic feature, I can't imagine contributing the obfuscation of this history to just incompetence. There must be some dark pattern here. Perhaps the want to hide from user's how much real money they are putting into the system? It seems like a serious security risk anyway. Someone with unauthorized access to an account could easily siphon off crypto and it would be difficult to notice unless you are frequently generating and downloading transaction reports and going through them.\nI am not finding much talk of this. Am I in the minority thinking that this is a mission critical, absolutely bare bones feature that should be front and center of any finance related app?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36179175\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 2",

How to prep for System Design Interviews, given that most resources out there are very superficial in their explanation of what technology to use, when to use it and why to use it?\n2. Will becoming good at prepping for System Design interviews actually help in designing large scale systems better?\n3. If not 2, then how do you become better at designing actual systems?\nI already know that DDIA is a good resource but it does not help you design concrete systems.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36115528\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "I'm seeing it's a common theme, especially in the Python community, to implement tightly coupled UIs and business logic. It's done in the name of convenience, but inevitably backfires once you go past trivial applications.\nI've lived the whole evolution of web-based applications, back when CSS didn't exist and PHP was something added to HTML to make it \"dynamic\". I'm glad web development has evolved; I think everyone is. But why do we have to go back to it, repackage it as something cool and make the same mistakes?\nI understand it's appealing to those whose title isn't \"software engineer\", because MVC can be a pain. Should it be though?\nI'm working in this space, building a state-driven half no-code/half Python framework , but rather than driving more attention to it I'd like to discuss the premise.\nIs this a battle worth fighting? Or am I making a big deal out of something no one cares about?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35977460\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I'm curious what methods people here use to avoid distractions when working on a computer. Obviously computers are excellent tools, but simply having access to an internet browser can be a gateway to a massive time sink.\nSome things I have tried:\n- Set up a Pi-Hole with distracting websites on the blacklist so the DNS requests do not resolve. I disabled this to dork around on the web today, so clearly not an effective commitment device.\n- \"Cold Turkey Writer\" which locks down your PC giving only a text box essentially, until you write X words. I didn't find this useful for my writing style since I tend to look up additional references/sources as I write, and losing access to that hurt my flow.\n- Using a Raspberry Pi 4B as my desktop PC, with the idea being I couldn't play games and YouTube isn't entertaining when 30% of the frames are dropping. I ended up wasting a bunch of time messing with Linux trying to get stuff to work (oh Obsidian needs to be compiled and installed for ARM, oh there's no Google Drive installer for Linux, let's set up rclone, oh the audio driver broke). It was cool to have a fanless, low-power PC but I went back to my Windows desktop out of frustration and desire to have things \"just work\".\nIs it futile to use hardware/software to try and fix a self-discipline issue? What works for you?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36346043\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "I’ve been using RSS readers for decades, but they’ve started feeling more and more like a chore. Something about the inbox/to-do list design, counts of unread items, managing teams and complex filtering rules... I realized they add to my stress level instead of reducing it.\nI’ve also come to rely on social media for discovery – hearing about new ideas, tools, papers, people, etc., but I’m so tired of the ads, spam, addictiveness, and toxicity.\nApricot is my attempt to distill the best of both worlds. It’s a web app where users subscribe to feeds like an RSS reader then see new items as they come in, in a single, combined, social media-style feed.\nApricot goes beyond traditional RSS readers in a couple other ways:\n  * Users can follow TV shows (via TVmaze), Spotify podcasts, Substack newsletters, YouTube channels, and Subreddits (if/when they come back online) in addition to traditional RSS feeds. I’m open to adding other platforms if there’s demand and the content is programmatically accessible.\n\n  * Cross-platform feed search. I know search isn’t hot at the moment but it’s pretty useful in this context. Search for “Star Trek” and find not just the TV shows, but the podcasts and Subreddits too.\n\n  * Items can be sorted chronologically or with an ML-powered recommender system.\n\n  * Users can filter their feed by platform, which is helpful for specific use cases like finding a good podcast episode for a car ride or a good TV episode to watch after dinner.\n\n  * On-demand, GPT-powered content summaries help users see what an article is really about before clicking. (gotta sprinkle some gen AI on there!)\n\nIf you’ve got a few minutes (and come on, with Reddit offline, I know you do), check it out and let me know what you think!\nApp: https://app.theapricot.io\nHomepage: https://theapricot.io\nBlog: https://blog.theapricot.io\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36314857\nPoints: 11\n# Comments: 17",

          "description": "Am I the only one using Thunderbird strictly as an RSS client? I've seen countless RSS clients recommended here over the years but none ever have the features to make me switch, mainly due to lacking extension support (for things like uBlock Origin and Bypass Paywalls) or privacy concerns from not running on a local Linux desktop. (I haven't heavily used the e-mail functionality in Thunderbird in over two decades. I haven't tried the Chat or any other functionality at all.)\nIs there something I'm missing out on? Is there a client with all the same features and then some that I just haven't found yet? I've looked at Feedly, Inoreader, and many others through the years but none have risen to the level of replacement. It's not broken so I'm not looking to fix it but I'm open to hearing how others manage their feeds to see if there's any possible improvements I've overlooked.\nFull disclosure: I've donated in the past to Thunderbird/Mozilla, including company matches.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36256681\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "I struggle with staying productive and organizing myself. I am a chronic procrastinator and have tried everything to be more productive like lists, calendars, apps, etc. but I still can't seem to get things done. I want to study more, read more, and finish my coding projects. However, I end up not doing much and feel terribly guilty. I suspect I may have ADHD or some kind of dopamine addiction but I'm not sure. I do well in school even by studying at the last minute, and I attend a rather challenging school. In my free time though, I end up doing very little or nothing, not knowing where my time went. I try to remove all distractions but it doesn't seem to work.\nDoes anyone have any advice or strategies on how I can improve my productivity and focus? How have you overcome similar challenges to achieve your goals and stay focused? I feel stuck in this cycle of procrastination and distraction and want to break free.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36184605\nPoints: 49\n# Comments: 62",

          "description": "I've been thinking a lot recently about how technology, particularly AI, can play a role in personal productivity. One concept that's caught my attention is the idea of an 'AI conversation companion' for tracking thoughts, ideas, and progress in various areas of life. Imagine having an AI that you can converse with on a regular basis, where it asks you thoughtful questions about topics you're interested in or working on. Over time, it adapts its questions based on your responses and generates summaries, which can be reviewed and reflected upon at any time.\nSuch an AI companion could act as a kind of automated journal or diary, providing a space for reflection and self-improvement, but with the added benefits of interactivity and adaptability. It could also serve as an accountability tool, reminding you of your goals and progress, and prompting regular reflection.\nWhat do you all think about the potential of using AI to aid productivity? Have you used any similar tools or services? What methods do you use today to prep helping future AI companions understand your life/goals?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36129315\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

The main differentiator is that Yakread uses machine learning to rank the articles in your feed: as you click on articles from a particular RSS/newsletter subscription, other articles from that subscription will tend to be ranked higher in the future (via a bandit algorithm). Yakread also uses ML to recommend articles that other users have read, so your feed will have articles in it even before you sign up and add your own subscriptions.\nFor the recommendations, I'm using the collaborative filtering implementation from Spark MLlib[1].

          "description": "I recently decided to document and open-source the component library that I've been using internally on all my react-tailwindcss projects and share it.\nRewind-UI uses only TailwindCSS classes, which can be overridden using the className prop on each component or can be fully customized using a theme provider.\nIt is built on top of the CVA (class-variance-authority - https://cva.style/docs) library, so if anyone needs to adjust the theme, will just need to edit the CVA files.\nFurthermore it must be noted that you can add either all the style files in your tailwind.config.js file, or only those that you are going to use, so that you can avoid having a bloated css file.\nYou can check out the repository here: https://github.com/rewindui/rewindui\nEven though it is still in beta I would love to hear your feedback on it.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36254203\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hi,\nI really like HN and the simplicity of everything (from create/login workflow to submit links). Everything is fast, straight to the point, and clean/simple HTML.\nI've just a really minor complaint: on wide screen, reading comments is really painful (for me at least, I maximise all my windows...). It's not the size of the font, it's really the width of lines on wide screen. I've the impression that we're a lot of developers on HN, with huge screens, and the wide screens experience could be better in \"vanilla\" HN.\nI sometimes open a link in HackerWeb (for instance https://hackerweb.app/#/item/36238342) just to have a better reading experience...\nEvery thing else: don't change, it's perfect!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36238841\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 2",

I created this lib in the need of a simple and tiny framework to easily do AJAX-style navigation / replacement of fragments in the page, in a web application.\nFor people who don't want to use client-side-rendering and complex frameworks à la React, there are nowadays a few \"HTML-over-the-wire\" libraries, like HTMX, Unpoly or this super-tiny one Swap.js :)\nOne other key thing is that no external tool is needed: no bundler, no webpack, no TypeScript compiler, no minification needed. Just write HTML, JS (+ your preferred server-side language: PHP, Python, etc.) and it works.\nThe framework makes use of fetch (of course) but also MutationObserver API to be able to launch actions when parts of the DOM change.\nLet me know what you think!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35991783\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Through the little Etsy store I've got, I offer Game Boy game repair mostly just so I get to \"play\" on different problems, and a different problem did arrive.\nThis Game Boy Advance game, although worked, requires a battery for the real time clock aspects of the game (i.e. timed events). The problem was that there was a repair attempt that had taken off the entire pad for the battery, and in fact had go through the pad, through the silk screen and had gone all the way into the fibre glass insulation layer (you might be able to see in the photo the woven pattern).\nBefore slapping a battery on and jumping the positive leg to the right component, I wanted to check that nothing else was missing. Thankfully the community have tried to preserve a lot of the history (in this case, the PCB traces) but also published it freely on the web.\nFrom this I also found a resistor had been lost in the previous repair. I don't think it's clear from my photo, but what I did was to bond the missing resistor in a completely different location (before it traces to a capacitor) and then use a jumper wire from the replaceable battery case. This was mostly in case the battery case was torn off again it wouldn't cause damage to the components on the board.\nOnce that was all done, the game happily had its clock and was returned to it's owner the same day.",

Then managed to pick up a faulty \"Color\" model for £40 on eBay listed as not working.\nOn inspection it looked, internally, very clean - no corrosion or damage. From my experience with Pokémon Mini handhelds, I was wondering if perhaps the power button wasn't getting the signal.\nSo I applied a slice of kitchen tin foil, some sticky tape and voilà, it powers up! I had to also apply it to the sound and start button (and I'll probably make this permanent with conductive paint one day), but otherwise it's all good.\n(And I snagged a flash cart so I was able to experience some translated romhacks too)",
