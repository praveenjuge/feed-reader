Illness, stress, a busy personal season or competing work priorities can reduce this temporarily for anyone.  Some people will have longer term lower capacity than others due to factors like life circumstances, health, and outside of work commitments.\nLeverage - People’s skills, experiences, tendencies, relationships a…",

Big meetings of more than 50 people will get shoehorned into a six-hour window on Thursdays, with a limit of one a week.\nThis is fascinating to me.  I get the desire to remove bloated meetings, but there are recurring meetings that I find genuinely valuable to have sync (project standups / staff meetings).

So this design is a bit more stripped back visually, without to many unnecessary flourishes, while still keeping some nice little touches, like animated underlines on hover.

Then you bring up a list of .env files to select from by clicking on a small button at the bottom of the window, and instantly switch to the desired environment. Nice!\nGet the extension →",

We have this card component that displays a health summary for the section of the app the user is currently inspecting (which could be a wind turbine, a system within that turbine, or the entire wind farm). Generally we want to show that towards the top left of the screen, with some other information on the right. On certain pages however, the information on the right will be absent, so we want the health summary component to go full width. Easy enough, but we also want to style the component differently when it takes up the entire width by aligning the text to the left and giving it a more horizontal layout.\nWhen we have two widgets to display, the left one should have center…",

          "description": "Psst… I’ve been keeping a secret. As part of my Web Components course on Frontend Masters, I built an entire guidebook on how to get started with Web Components. A Web Components 101. I spent hundreds of hours preparing the materials for the course and I’m excited to announce that today I’m making the guidebook public for everyone to get started with Web Components.\nRead the Guidebook\nThis guidebook is different! Most Web Component resources drop you right into the JavaScript parts. Ughck. That’s fine, I guess, but seeing the markup for a <my-button> component doesn’t make my heart or brain sing. It also doesn’t help me understand one of Web Components’ biggest mental hurdles: The Shadow DOM. To overcome this, I’ve intentionally designed my course to build out layer-by-layer from HTML→CSS→JavaScript, like how old timers learned the web development in the past.\nStarting with <template> and <slot> –and most certainly with Web Component styling– you become familiar with the quirks of Shadow DOM first before writing your own from scratch. Following the navigation from left-to-right you’ll learn the ins-and-outs of Using → Styling → Writing the different flavors of Web Components. And because it’s part of the Web Platform, that knowledge will always be valuable.\nHTML-first may seem overly basic, but I find that lots of new and experienced developers alike have never even tried using a Web Component off the shelf. That’s my favorite part of Web Components! You can use lots of Web Components without a build process or any kind of Webpack sorcery. A script tag + HTML and you’re using them! Web Components make it easy to (dependably) use other people’s code.\nYou can of course still watch my Web Components course on Frontend Masters. I recommend it if you’re an visual or auditory learner like myself. There’s also a bit more back-and-forth with the live audience and their questions.",

Some developers even create a full set of features that can be used while offline.\nWith web apps, the capability to work offline is more recent; it became possible with the launch of the Service Worker API. Also, when websites became installable, PWA added a requirement to register a service worker and implement its fetch() method in order for a web app to be installable.\nThe idea was to incentivize developers to provide their users at least a notice that the app couldn’t be used at the moment.\nNow developers won’t need to do anything to get a default offline page. From Chrome 109 on Android, the browser will automatically generate a page that lets the user know when they are offline.\nIf the app doesn’t implement a custom offline experience, when the user is offline, the default offline page uses the app’s icon and simple You are offline message. Like the example below.\nVisit this glitch to see the previous example in action.\nThe option to create your own custom offline page is still available.

The chrome.offscreen API documentation is now available in chrome extensions.\nIn Chromium, Manifest V3 extensions are service worker-based, but service workers don't provide support for the same APIs and mechanisms that full document-based pages (which include background and event pages) do.

Playful, shape-based lettering is still prevalent throughout many modern designs, along with many geometric stylings.\nIn fact, the colors, more than anything else, tend to give most MCM graphic designs a “retro” feeling.

          "description": "I'm pretty sure I originally found this on HN some years ago, maybe someone here can help me find it again.\nI remember a video of a very small hydro power demo, about a meter across, something along the lines of a gravitational water vortex power plant[0], but instead of the usual turbine they had a pretty big, uh, piece (\"runner\"?) in the middle of the chamber with the vortex, taking up most of the space. I believe the idea was to extract energy from very low flows. I seem to recall the people presenting it were Swiss, or something else vaguely germanic, but I'm not really sure.\nAnyway, I've thought about this thing for years, decided to try to find it again, and mostly failed in my google-fu. I don't remember anything of the specific language used to describe it, just the visual. If anyone knows good search terms for this, I'm happy to hear those as well.\nThanks!\n[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation_water_vortex_power_plant, discussed here https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16891441\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34448284\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "I've noticed that I'm design-blind. As long as something is functional, and I have an accurate conceptual model of how it works, I can deal with it. The important part (to me) is whether I can do the things I want done without the product getting in the way. For example, Jira does a terrible job of this, by getting in the way.\nWhat I've come to realise is that this is only a small part of the picture. There's a lot more that goes into design: a product helping you build an accurate model, showing you what's possible, getting out of your way, and the emotional positive response because of the sheer attention to detail.\nRecently reading Design of Everyday Things, and I _love_ it because it helped me formulate a model of what objectively good design looks like.\nI read RefactoringUI as well, and this felt a lot more 'here are some good rule of thumbs to follow'. Awesome, but I feel I'm still fumbling in the dark. I find myself falling back to these because I don't know better.\nSo, do you have any tips or resources for helping improve design sense?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34425693\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 2",

You can use Sheets for internal tools, BI, ad hoc analysis, you name it.\nHowever, it's extremely tricky to sync data between G sheets and NoSQL databases like MongoDB. This limits the usefulness of either tool.\nSo, what options are there? There are a few.\nMethod #1: Write your own script\nYou could build your own in-house solution using Google's API and MongoDB change streams.

          "description": "I'm normally someone who builds my core React components for a given project from scratch; it's not hard and I have maximum control if needs change (and don't have to go read a bunch of docs)\nBut right now I need to build a boring admin interface for somebody, with limited time to dedicate to it and it doesn't matter what the look and feel is or anything. So I'm considering pulling in a library like MUI so I can more quickly just bang out an interface and move forward\nQuestion is: does Material UI's convenience outweigh the extra complexity of adding a dependency, reading its docs, learning its conventions, etc? Especially for a relatively quick and simple thing\n(MUI-specific anecdotes only please; not interested in speculation or in discussions about the broader question of whether to add a dependency to a project)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34383168\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "What - I am working on a specification/language which can describe a traditional system design process for web-services.\nWhy - Having a language for system-design will improve design interviews and system documentation. It can also give rise to \"Competitive Designing\" industry same as \"Competetive Programming\" exists currently.\nHow - I am exploring existing specs (Docker-compose, OpenAPI and UML) and a way to merge them. They will define the system.\nFor the actual execution, I will use the spec to setup a sandbox environments and run blank instances of services in them. Then I would use custom defined API flows from the spec to simulate an actually running system.\nThis is not the hard part. The hard part is finding a way to benchmark these API flows which gives reliable scores for the effectiveness of the system for a given problem and API flows.\nHappy to discuss more.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34271635\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

Why do so many... hacker type individuals seem to prefer very brutalist, utilitarian designs over anything more fancy? Where did this preference for plain text at the expense of all else come from anyway?\nBecause I don't think this happens quite as much in other fields, like architecture, cooking or construction.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34246340\nPoints: 35\n# Comments: 78",

I built it for myself, but after a few tweaks, I opened up the repository for anyone with a GitHub account to fork or clone. To use it, just configure your own favourite RSS feeds, set up a cron schedule, and provide your own SMTP server.\nThe email can be fully customised and is made with this great new library: react-email. The project includes a development server, which you can run locally to test any tweaks you want to make to the email template.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34518234\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

I downloaded archived RSS files in archive.org, like for http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml. Unfortunately I have noticed that some days are missing in the archive.org.\nI think it is a good idea, if you have a favorite site, which has a RSS source, to make a call to store it regularly in archive.org for 'the next generations'. https://help.archive.org/help/save-pages-in-the-wayback-machine/.\nI have updated my RSS client to make a such call everyday, even for my fav YouTube RSS sources.\nEven if 'link rot' gets in a way, this might be insightful to see at least link, or title, or description of the RSS entry. Historians might consider it useful some day.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34424957\nPoints: 16\n# Comments: 4",

I know everyone has different preferences and work styles, but I can’t help but think what I’ve been able to apply would be useful for other developers at my company.\nUndoubtedly, there are other developers at my company have their own set of programs/workflows they use to increase their efficiency that I think could be useful to me and others.\nI'm curious to know what strategies other developers use or have used within their company to share productivity tips and programs with their colleagues. For example, is there a dedicated Teams/Slack channel, an internal wiki, or some other type of software where engineers can share/demo programs and shortcuts they use in their day-to-day work?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34330634\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I've been experimenting with a smart RSS reader and I've been using Superfeedr to ingest content.  Superfeedr monitors RSS feeds and calls a webhook when content arrives,  I stuff these into an Amazon SQS and then spool them out at my leisure.\nMy system requires a fairly high volume (1000's of articles) to train a machine learning model so I have been focusing on high volume feeds like preprints from the arXiv,  news from the Guardian, etc.\nNow Superfeedr charges 10¢ per feed per month,  my bill right now is $3 a month.  It's reasonable that I can subscribe to about 100 feeds on Superfeedr but subscribing to 1000 feeds seems pricey to me.\nThere are a lot of independent blogs out there that publish an article every week or every six months.  What they all have in common is that somebody has to poll an RSS file many many many times per article ingested.  W/ superfeedr it makes for high costs but it is a hassle even if I built my own RSS ingest system.\nOne thing that would help would be consolidated RSS feeds that aggregate posts from a large number of blogs.  Are there good ones out there?  Are there other answers to problem of polling hundreds or thousands of independent blogs?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34330134\nPoints: 11\n# Comments: 9",

          "description": "I wrote an RSS reader called RSS Brain recently. The motivate is the current RSS readers either don't sort articles by priority, which makes it hard to read posts from HackerNews and Reddit, or sort it with some \"smart\" algorithm which I don't trust. I also like the Google News feature that can show related story from different source, but the sources are not configurable and the algorithm is not transparent either. So with RSS Brain, I implemented these features:\n* Recommend related articles from the feeds of your choice. It's backed by ElasticSearch and the algorithm is described on RSS Brain's website.\n* Option to sort articles by upvotes and time. The algorithm is similar to the old Reddit and you can find it on the website as well.\n* Save search terms into folders so you can filter the articles.\nI've been using it for a while and found these features very helpful. So I want to share this on HackerNews. The frontend is written in Flutter so it has cross platform clients, even though the web version don't feel very \"web native\" because the level of Flutter web support. I guess only time can improve that.\nI don't have enough hardware to scale it up so it's currently in subscription mode to limit the users. I'm going to open source the code (maybe non-commercial license) once I think it's ready so you can host it by yourself. It's still in early stage and haven't been tested by a lot of people. So any feedback is helpful. Thanks!\nUpdate: Added a scroll down hint in the landing page. Thanks for the feedback.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34188734\nPoints: 66\n# Comments: 52",

          "description": "Hey HN, my name is Mokshit and I'm really interested in web-performance and web-development. At the time of writing this, I'm a junior in high school.\nMacaron is a typesafe CSS-in-JS library with zero runtime, colocation, maximum safety and productivity.\nThe motivation behind it is that runtime CSS-in-JS libraries, that is most of the CSS-in-JS libs, add alot of bloat to web apps and have a considerable performance drop with a bundle size increase. Alot of them also don't support more performant ways of building web apps like streaming markup. Most of the current compile-time CSS-in-JS libraries try to fix this, but have some or the other drawback like not offering colocation, or not being type-safe.\nToday, Macaron does all this with a compiler that extracts all the style declarations at compile-time and converts them to static css files while also letting you author the type-safe styles in the same file as your application code. It supports both - a vanilla styling API and a styled-component API with support for multiple frameworks like SolidJS and React and build tools like Vite and Esbuild. Macaron is currently missing a webpack plugin, but that will also be published soon, making it compatible with almost all bundlers.\nThere's a ton of room for improvement in this space, and I feel like macaron is a step in that direction.\nGithub - https://github.com/macaron-css/macaron\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34368626\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "At one point during the construction of my house, we needed designs for the kitchen and bathroom cabinets and a bedroom wardrobe.\nI wanted full control of the design process. Doing it in vector illustration software was too painful and it was taking too long. But I didn't have the time to learn any complex CAD tool either.\nSo I developed a small HTML/JS/CSS tool for designing MDF furniture by writing my own little language that transpiles into a CSS grid layout.\nTake a look at the blog post for details:\nhttps://alnvdl.github.io/2023/01/07/designing-furniture-usin...\nOr go directly to the tool (works best on desktop or tablet): https://alnvdl.github.io/squareplanner/\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34290524\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",
