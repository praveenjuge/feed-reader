Recently I noticed a handy feature in Firefox dev tools to make checking for sufficient colour contrast really easy.\nIf you inspect an element’s CSS in the dev tools inspector you’ll notice any colours are accompanied by a little colour swatch. Clicking on this brings up a colour picker — handy for trying out different colour options in the browser. For the color property, this colour picker also shows the contrast ratio of the text colour compared to the colour beneath (either the element’s background colour, or the background colour of an element beneath). It turns out Chrome has a very similar feature too. That’s super useful for experimenting with accessible colour combinations, without even leaving your browser tab!\nColour contrast simulator\nFirefox has another useful feature for checking our colours are accessible: the colour contrast simulator. Found in the “Accessibility” tab in the dev tools panel, this feature simulates different colour vision deficiencies. Check out the full write-up.",

As developers, we can enjoy the fruits of this collaboration, with features like container queries, cascade layers and dynamic viewport units going from little or no browser support to almost full support in the space of a year.\nInterop 2023 has just been announced, expanding to 26 focus areas. Some exciting CSS features include the :has() pseudo-class, which is already supported in some browsers, as well as Level 4 media queries, math functions, and font palette features, which enable custom coloured fonts.\nRead the Interop teams’ write-ups here:\nWebKit\nGoogle\nIgalia\nMicrosoft\nMozilla\nBocoup",

That means there’s no server building the pages on demand. Instead, every time I write a blog post in markdown and commit the file to the Github repository, the site is re-built — with Eleventy generating a static HTML page from my markdown file — and deployed on Netlify’s servers. Pretty cool, right?\nIn order to set up automated deployments you need to link your Github repository to your Netlify account, then configure your build settings — including the build command you want to use (e.g. npm run build), and the directory to publish from. This isn’t a tutorial on how to deploy…",

Also, I was just sick of looking at it! So this design is a bit more stripped back visually, without to many unnecessary flourishes, while still keeping some nice little touches, like animated underlines on hover. Other improvements include a better mobile experience (via the expanding/collapsing tag menu), and the ability to filter by category of post (currently “articles”, “notes” or “quick tips”, which I might add to over time).\nIf I had any se…",

Generally we want to show that towards the top left of the screen, with some other information on the right. On certain pages however, the information on the right will be absent, so we want the health summary component to go full width. Easy enough, but we also want to style the component differently when it takes up the entire width by aligning the text to the left and giving it a more horizontal layout.\nWhen we have two widgets to display, the left one should have center…",

This seemed urgent, so I shuffled in his office as quick as I could.\nOn the screen was a grey’ish looking website. Bryan made websites. I made websites. We had that in common. And playing guitar. He looked me in the eyes and said “This is Flex. It’s the future of websites and you need to learn it.”  And from what he was showing me, I was impressed and astounded. A fully rich internet application. XML-powered tables and lists with sorting and animations that you’d spend months building in Flash. I had never seen anything this professional before.\n\nFlex was the successor to Flash. Or a better way to put it, Flex was Flash but for app…",

His style is approachable and beginner friendly. If you’re getting started with web development or want to improve your HTML and CSS chops, I highly recommend you like and subscribe.\nKevin is like other talented web developers I know; knows about Web Components but hasn’t dug in and used them yet. We follow my course guidebook, starting with HTML → moving on to CSS → and then start to get into JavaScript towards the end but we ran out of time to go super deep on that topic. If you liked this livestream or want to know more about writing Web Components or building systems with Web Components, there’s more in my Frontend Masters course.",

My house lost power and internet on Wednesday morning as thick tree limbs snapped under the weight of ice, taking out power lines and transformers on their journey to the ground. Hurricane-like devastation. We took refuge at a friend’s house who had power, then lost power, but had a backup generator. I went back and forth to the house to saw branches and sleep with the animals in our cold, powerless house. In total, 125 hours without power, beating out the previous record of 75 hours set in 2021.\nLast week brought up a lot of trauma from the 2021 Freeze. My wife and I wonder how much of the off-grid prepper lifestyle we need to ado…",

What I like most about the hobby is that the models are “press-fit”, meaning you can build the entire model by pressing the parts together with your fingers. No gluing, no painting, just fingers. You can follow the directions and have a little plastic robot model in one sitting. That low-barrier of entry is a key part of what makes Gunpla fun.\nAlthough tools are not required, a handful of tools improve the experience and output. As I’ve been progressing at Gunpla, my modest toolset has evolved. This post is a half “how it started / how it’s going” post about my Gunpla tools and half a reflection about tools in general.

          "description": "We are creating some How-To Videos for Luro. Exciting to be at that point in product development, but it would be nice if our videos had captions from day one to set a precedent. We could pay to have them all transcribed, or pay for some automated caption service, or even upload them all to YouTube and get transcriptions once those finish processing… but ughck, those options are extra work and not “lean” in spirit.\nThat’s when we noticed Slack started adding transcriptions for any video we upload. We had transcriptions! In the spirit of patching the Web, I wrote a one-liner console script to yoink those VTT transcriptions from Slack for Web with a little URL hacking.\nFind the uploaded video in Slack, click “View Transcript” in the caption below the video, then click the “Expand” button to see the video and the transcript side-by-side. Then put this in the console:\n\n$('video').poster.split('/').slice(0,-1).join('/') + '/file.vtt'\n\n\n⚠️ Warning: Auto-captions —what the deaf community lovingly refer to as “auto-craptions”— have limitations. For example, it transcribes our “Luro” as “Laura” and is entirely wrong and non-sensical at times. I point this out to show that you’ll need a human in the mix to proofread and fix captions. Be extra alert when dealing with technical content.\nAnyways, hope this is helpful.",

This change is already in\nFirefox, will land in Chrome from version 110,\nand is expected to land in\nSafari soon.\nThe Web Share API allows you to share\ntext, URLs, or files. In its simplest form, the share code looks something like this:\ntry {\n  await navigator.share({\n    title: 'Title',\n    text: 'Text',\n    url: location.href,\n  });\n} catch (err) {\n  console.error(`${err.name}: ${err.message}`);\n}\nIf a sharing action needs to happen in a third-party iframe, a\nrecent spec change requires you to explicitly allow the\noperation. Do this by adding an allow attribute\nto the <iframe> tag with a value of web-share. This tells the browser that the embedding site allows the embedded\nthird-party iframe to trigger the share action.\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <body>\n    <h1>Web Share in third-party iframes</h1>\n    <!-- The embedding page is hosted on https://example.com/index.html. -->\n    <iframe allow=\"web-share\" src=\"https://third-party.example.com/iframe.html\"></iframe>\n  </body>\n</html>\nYou can see this in action in a demo on Glitch\nand view the\nsource code.\nFailing to provide the attribute will result in a NotAllowedError with the message\nFailed to execute 'share' on 'Navigator': Permission denied.

From Chrome 109 on Android, the browser will automatically generate a page that lets the user know when they are offline.\nIf the app doesn’t implement a custom offline experience, when the user is offline, the default offline page uses the app’s icon and simple You are offline message.

Requesting this permission allows for the creation of off-screen documents to use DOM APIs without obtrusively opening new windows or tabs that interrupt the user experience. The chrome.offscreen API documentation is now available in chrome extensions.\nIn Chromium, Manifest V3 extensions are service worker-based, but service workers don't provide support for the same APIs and mechanisms that full document-based pages (which include background and event pages) do.

This graphic design trend took the world by storm post-WWII for a good reason. The clean and straightforward lines did a lot to inspire future trends, including the minimalist movement that so many designers are so fond of.\nAnd although these designs definitely give off a “retro” vibe, mid-century modern elements in graphic design aren’t going anywhere any time soon. Playful, shape-based lettering is still prevalent throughout many modern designs, along with many geometric stylings.\nIn fact, the colors, more than anything else, tend to give most MCM graphic designs a “retro” feeling. Trade in the earthy browns, oranges, and greens for some greyscale and neons, and you have a more modern Mid-century Modern aesthetic that any Palm Springs resident would be ecstatic about.  ■\nMid-Century Modern Graphic Design Inspiration\n\n    \n      Shot Link\n\n    \n\n    \n      Shot Link\n\n    \nKyle Anthony Miller, \n      Ethan Silva, \n      Victoria Fernández. \n    Row 2:\n      Whitney Anderson, \n      Steve Wolf, \n      Whitney Anderson. \n    Row 3:\n      Zara Picken, \n      Lisa Engler, \n      Mia Ditmanson. \n    Row 4:\n      Justin Mezzell, \n      Justin Mezzell, \n      Nicola Broderick. \n    Row 5:\n      Tracy Niven, \n      Chad Gowey for Blindtiger Design, \n      Normform. \n\n\n\n\n\nMore design inspiration\nDesign by the Decades: Y2K graphic design trends\nDesign by the Decades: 80s graphic design trends\nGet inspired: Retro branding with a modern twist",

          "description": "Is there an (easy|simple|sane) [pick one from 3] way to automate animation tests that include User Interaction?\nI ask because earlier this evening I deployed an update/NPM version bump of my Canvas library, after spending much of the day reviewing all the demo tests in various browsers on various devices. Only to watch as the new version broke the library's associated website's build tools. A stupid bug (2 chars) which meant having to fix it, test essential demos in various browsers etc before doing another release on GitHub and publishing the new version on NPM.\nI know this process can be easier. But the thing that holds me back from automating the heck out of my test/release process is that I'm clueless about how to test the library's functionality. It's a library to make working with 2D Canvas elements \"more fun\", so I test manually because I need to *see* that things - in particular animations - are working as I expect them to work.\nThe test suite is here: https://scrawl-v8.rikweb.org.uk/demo/index.html\nAny advice is really welcome!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34767180\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "What:\nFeedgrid is a news aggregator for RSS and Atom feeds.\nIt lets you organize your feeds into related topics and view feed items in 2-dimensional grids, rather than a single infinite scroll column.\nThe goal is to have a highly configurable tool to organize diverse feeds in a visual way, and then easily check for new content with a bird's eye view.\nWhy:\n- there’s a lot of stuff on the web, but you want it in 1 place, organized by categories that make sense to you\n- RSS is nice in principle but most readers feel like an overloaded email inbox (i.e. kinda stressful—you already have other inboxes to deal with..)\n- you like breadth-first search rather than depth-first search when you’re on the john and looking for some infotainment, but TikTok is frenetic and unsettling to you because you still like reading\nHow:\n- we’re running a Django app with some minimal js in the frontend, and serve grid pages as a modest-sized html blob with enough content for one sitting, and offer old-school pagination to get more content\n- the backend web scraping is entirely separate from the server, and uses scrapy. Scrapers are deployed on VMs, launching scrapy crawler instances dynamically based on feed SLA data in the db; there is no “scheduler”, but rather long-running parent coordinators launching child subprocesses as needed, so SLAs (and other attributes) can be modified by site admins without touching spiders\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34746972\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hey HN,\nI’d like to introduce, our app, Mockup - the ideal design tool for sketching and creating blueprints for apps or web designs.\nOne of my end goals is to make the design process easy and intuitive and that's exactly what Mockup does with its 45+ templates, flexible canvas, Library to save your elements, and a range of other attributes. With features like the Lasso tool, text and image insertion, 4000 symbols from Apple's SF Symbols library, and a customizable grid, your design possibilities are endless.\nAnd, the best part? I've just released a brand new update, packed with features suggested by our users to make the design experience even better like arrange objects, copy & paste, and an enhanced toolbar. Not to mention, users can now publish their elements to the community and access elements created by others as well as create UI  for TV apps with the highly requested newly added TV template.\nI can't wait for you to try it out!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34741935\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Lately I have been learning Jetpack Compose (for Android). Its new and shiny, like its counterpart SwiftUI (Apple), but there are older frameworks that take this approach, like React.\nThe main problem being solved, according to the marketing materials, is that its easier to keep state in sync with UI by regenerating the UI as state changes. Lots of work goes into avoiding updating the tree of UI that hasn't changed. This sounds good.\nIs the declarative approach the way forward for all 2d UIs (even outside mobile)? Is there still merit with the older approach of stateful widget trees and mutating their state imperatively? Where will we see the traditional (imperative) way maintain its niche compared to declarative UIs?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34712664\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "Hello HN!\nJust shipped my first digital product, Design Navigator: https://navigator.designdisciplin.com/\nI've been designing, studying design, and teaching design for many years. One of the biggest challenges I faced was how my profession is divided into different \"worlds\". Designers employed at companies, freelancers, academics, creators... All seem to live in different worlds.\nI developed Design Navigator to help designers choose their world and excel in it.\nIt starts with a simple questionnaire and recommends to you one of four worlds, along with a set of resources to dive deep: employment, freelancing, founder, and creator. Of course, the best way to use it is to check out all four of the \"worlds\", get into some of the resources, and then make up your mind.\nBuilt using Next.js, TailwindCSS, Vercel, etc. – nothing fancy from a tech standpoint. But I'm particularly proud of the front end design, wanted to show off some of my skills, and it was received well.\nOver the years I've learned a lot from HN, and incorporated many YC resources into Design Navigator, especially for the Founder path. While it's mainly intended for designers (and particularly UI, UX, web designers, etc.), I'm sure many of us in tech can find some inspiration in it. I hope you enjoy it!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34640075\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

Designers know what they're signing up for and can still benefit greatly from the experience. They have the chance to learn and improve their skills, and may even end up with a one-on-one client project as a result.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34639554\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I've been working as a software engineer for a little over half a decade (2 jobs).\nIn my experience, every time I get specifications from a product manager (PM) or mock ups from a designer, they are very vague and incomplete. When I'm told to implement things based on these specifications, I often find myself going back to them to get missing details and ask about use cases not covered. Sometimes, I'll have partway implemented something only for the specs to suddenly change after asking about a different part!\nI'm aware many jobs list working with PMs and UI/UX designers as a requirement, but it has gone past an acceptable level for me - I do not want to use the word \"incompetent\" to describe how I view their work output, but that is how I've slowly grown to feel about it.\nSo a few questions:\n1. Are poor specifications a common occurrence in the industry?\n2. Is there a way to improve the initial and ongoing quality of specifications as a non-PM and non-designer?\n3. Should software engineers have a say in the specs or should they defer to PMs and designers and stick to technical implementation?\n4. What kinds of places will give software engineers control over these specifications?\n5. Is there a role which combines pm/designer/engineer into one?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34559063\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 8",

          "description": "I've been coming to Hacker News since 2005. Over that time it's grown by many orders of magnitude.\nThe quality of the links has fluctuated but on the whole have stayed strong and, if anything, improved over time. I don't know what the filtering process is but it works well - the articles feel pure and deeply interesting.\nBut the comments are trickier. As the size of the audience has grown, so have the number of comments. Which has the potential to be really interesting, except for the propensity of the UI to drive both readers and commenters deep into rabbitholes.\nI used to love seeing the breadth of reactions to an article (or a new company). I could scan the comments to see what Hacker News thought. I quickly could get an idea of different perspectives and opinions. I could absorb the reaction of the Silicon Valley Coding Diaspora.\nThese days though it feels, at best, a deep, cloistered exploration of one POV, and at worst a triggered cascade of pedantry.\nThere are still amazing people and amazing observations in there. But they're not easy to get to. There's no easy way to scan the comments to get a sense of the breadth of reaction - it's just a case of wading through all of them.\nBack when I was in my 20s and soaking up everything I possibly could, I would happily invest that time. These days it doesn't feel like such a good trade-off.\nAnd I fear that in turn that penalises the potential breadth of reaction that this remarkable audience posesses. And reduces the participation of others who have less time - many of whom are more senior (decide for yourself whether you value that perspective).\nIf I could wave a wand, I'd love to see the threads collapsed by default. I feel like there are lot of potential UI wins that could further broaden engagement.\nWould love to hear everyone else's thoughts...\n(Also... and I'm sure I'm thousandth person to ask this... how on earth is it that there is no dark mode to this dev-mecca?!)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34545536\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 3",

          "description": "I'm pretty sure I originally found this on HN some years ago, maybe someone here can help me find it again.\nI remember a video of a very small hydro power demo, about a meter across, something along the lines of a gravitational water vortex power plant[0], but instead of the usual turbine they had a pretty big, uh, piece (\"runner\"?) in the middle of the chamber with the vortex, taking up most of the space. I believe the idea was to extract energy from very low flows. I seem to recall the people presenting it were Swiss, or something else vaguely germanic, but I'm not really sure.\nAnyway, I've thought about this thing for years, decided to try to find it again, and mostly failed in my google-fu. I don't remember anything of the specific language used to describe it, just the visual. If anyone knows good search terms for this, I'm happy to hear those as well.\nThanks!\n[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation_water_vortex_power_plant, discussed here https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16891441\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34448284\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "I've noticed that I'm design-blind. As long as something is functional, and I have an accurate conceptual model of how it works, I can deal with it. The important part (to me) is whether I can do the things I want done without the product getting in the way. For example, Jira does a terrible job of this, by getting in the way.\nWhat I've come to realise is that this is only a small part of the picture. There's a lot more that goes into design: a product helping you build an accurate model, showing you what's possible, getting out of your way, and the emotional positive response because of the sheer attention to detail.\nRecently reading Design of Everyday Things, and I _love_ it because it helped me formulate a model of what objectively good design looks like.\nI read RefactoringUI as well, and this felt a lot more 'here are some good rule of thumbs to follow'. Awesome, but I feel I'm still fumbling in the dark. I find myself falling back to these because I don't know better.\nSo, do you have any tips or resources for helping improve design sense?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34425693\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 2",

You can use Sheets for internal tools, BI, ad hoc analysis, you name it.\nHowever, it's extremely tricky to sync data between G sheets and NoSQL databases like MongoDB. This limits the usefulness of either tool.\nSo, what options are there? There are a few.\nMethod #1: Write your own script\nYou could build your own in-house solution using Google's API and MongoDB change streams.

          "description": "I'm normally someone who builds my core React components for a given project from scratch; it's not hard and I have maximum control if needs change (and don't have to go read a bunch of docs)\nBut right now I need to build a boring admin interface for somebody, with limited time to dedicate to it and it doesn't matter what the look and feel is or anything. So I'm considering pulling in a library like MUI so I can more quickly just bang out an interface and move forward\nQuestion is: does Material UI's convenience outweigh the extra complexity of adding a dependency, reading its docs, learning its conventions, etc? Especially for a relatively quick and simple thing\n(MUI-specific anecdotes only please; not interested in speculation or in discussions about the broader question of whether to add a dependency to a project)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34383168\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "What:\nFeedgrid is a news aggregator for RSS and Atom feeds.\nIt lets you organize your feeds into related topics and view feed items in 2-dimensional grids, rather than a single infinite scroll column.\nThe goal is to have a highly configurable tool to organize diverse feeds in a visual way, and then easily check for new content with a bird's eye view.\nWhy:\n- there’s a lot of stuff on the web, but you want it in 1 place, organized by categories that make sense to you\n- RSS is nice in principle but most readers feel like an overloaded email inbox (i.e. kinda stressful—you already have other inboxes to deal with..)\n- you like breadth-first search rather than depth-first search when you’re on the john and looking for some infotainment, but TikTok is frenetic and unsettling to you because you still like reading\nHow:\n- we’re running a Django app with some minimal js in the frontend, and serve grid pages as a modest-sized html blob with enough content for one sitting, and offer old-school pagination to get more content\n- the backend web scraping is entirely separate from the server, and uses scrapy. Scrapers are deployed on VMs, launching scrapy crawler instances dynamically based on feed SLA data in the db; there is no “scheduler”, but rather long-running parent coordinators launching child subprocesses as needed, so SLAs (and other attributes) can be modified by site admins without touching spiders\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34746972\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "By combining a couple of open-source projects, I created a simple, personalised solution for consuming your favourite RSS feeds via email. I built it for myself, but after a few tweaks, I opened up the repository for anyone with a GitHub account to fork or clone. To use it, just configure your own favourite RSS feeds, set up a cron schedule, and provide your own SMTP server.\nThe email can be fully customised and is made with this great new library: react-email. The project includes a development server, which you can run locally to test any tweaks you want to make to the email template.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34518234\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

I downloaded archived RSS files in archive.org, like for http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml. Unfortunately I have noticed that some days are missing in the archive.org.\nI think it is a good idea, if you have a favorite site, which has a RSS source, to make a call to store it regularly in archive.org for 'the next generations'. https://help.archive.org/help/save-pages-in-the-wayback-machine/.\nI have updated my RSS client to make a such call everyday, even for my fav YouTube RSS sources.\nEven if 'link rot' gets in a way, this might be insightful to see at least link, or title, or description of the RSS entry. Historians might consider it useful some day.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34424957\nPoints: 16\n# Comments: 4",

          "description": "I have used rudimentary scrapers for years but always found that the process of training them doesn’t scale as well as I expect. In a scenario where one needs hundreds of scrapers all grabbing the same five or 10 pieces of information (dates, names, addresses, and ID numbers) is it possible to just grab the raw HTML and train an NLP model to find the relevant data rather than selecting specific selectors/paths?\nIt seems to me that finding these items in an HTML doc would be a trivial task for NLP and this would allow us to forgo scraper maintenance in the event that websites change. Assuming that I already have hundreds of thousands or millions of records in structured data that could be used for training, would modern tools make this a more efficient way of ingesting data?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34755877\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

As someone who has never enjoyed working with frontend JS frameworks (yes, I sucked it up and learned them and have worked with them professionally) I'm wondering who all the companies are who have embraced the semi-recent \"HTML over the wire\" movement (Can you imagine... using hyper text transfer protocol for transferring hyper text?  Seems nuts, I know).  It's a massive slog shifting through endless React/Vue/etc-focused jobs out there.  Even if you use React in small areas where it pulls its weight but generally try and stick to simplicity of sending plain ol' HTML, I'd love to know who you are.  Even if you aren't hiring, it's nice knowing you're out there fighting the good fight :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34744348\nPoints: 106\n# Comments: 139",

          "description": "Hi, I'm a web developer with several years of experience developing websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I´ve also developed several full stack applications with relatively complex backends (mainly Ruby/Ruby on Rails).\nI'm currently on a teaching non-tenure track (teaching web technologies), which I love, but the pay in my country is very low.\nI'm confident I have the creativity and formal knowledge to develop high quality static websites. So I'm looking for opportunities.\nThat said, I return to my initial question: is there still demand for semantic, performant, custom static websites?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34526584\nPoints: 16\n# Comments: 8",
